Inhibition
of
monoamine
oxidase
type
A
,
but
not
type
B
,
is
an
effective
means
of
inducing
anticonvulsant
activity
in
the
kindling
model
of
epilepsy
.

The
anticonvulsant
activity
of
inhibitors
of
monoamine
oxidase
(
MAO
)
was
reported
early
after
the
development
of
irreversible
MAO
inhibitors
such
as
tranylcypromine
,
but
was
never
clinically
used
because
of
the
adverse
effects
of
these
compounds
.

The
more
recently
developed
reversible
MAO
inhibitors
with
selectivity
for
either
the
MAO
-
A
or
MAO
-
B
isoenzyme
forms
have
not
been
studied
extensively
in
animal
models
of
epilepsy
,
so
it
is
not
known
which
type
of
MAO
inhibitor
is
particularly
effective
in
this
respect
.

We
compared
the
following
drugs
in
the
kindling
model
of
epilepsy
:
1
)
L
-
deprenyl
(
selegiline
)
,
i
.
e
.
,
an
irreversible
inhibitor
of
MAO
-
B
,
which
,
however
,
also
inhibits
MAO
-
A
at
higher
doses
,
2
)
the
novel
reversible
MAO
-
B
inhibitor
LU
53439
(
3
,
4
-
dimethyl
-
7
-
(
2
-
isopropyl
-
1
,
3
,
4
-
thiadiazol
-
5
-
yl
)
-
methoxy
-
coumarin
)
,
which
is
much
more
selective
for
MAO
-
B
than
L
-
deprenyl
,
3
)
the
novel
reversible
and
highly
selective
MAO
-
A
inhibitor
LU
43839
(
esuprone
;
7
-
hydroxy
-
3
,
4
-
dimethylcoumarin
ethanesulfonate
)
,
and
4
)
the
irreversible
nonselective
MAO
inhibitor
tranylcypromine
.

Esuprone
proved
to
be
an
effective
anticonvulsant
in
the
kindling
model
with
a
similar
potency
as
L
-
deprenyl
.

In
contrast
to
esuprone
and
L
-
deprenyl
,
the
selective
MAO
-
B
inhibitor
LU
53439
was
not
effective
in
the
kindling
model
;
this
substantiates
the
previous
notion
that
the
anticonvulsant
activity
of
L
-
deprenyl
is
not
related
to
MAO
-
B
inhibition
,
but
to
other
effects
of
this
drug
,
such
as
inhibition
of
MAO
-
A
.

Drugs
inhibiting
both
MAO
-
A
and
MAO
-
B
to
a
similar
extent
(
tranylcypromine
)
or
combinations
of
selective
MAO
-
A
and
MAO
-
B
inhibitors
(
esuprone
plus
LU
53439
)
had
no
advantage
over
MAO
-
A
inhibition
alone
,
but
were
less
well
tolerated
.

The
data
thus
suggest
that
selective
MAO
-
A
inhibitors
such
as
esuprone
may
be
an
interesting
new
approach
for
the
treatment
of
epilepsy
.

Effects
of
mCPP
on
the
extracellular
concentrations
of
serotonin
and
dopamine
in
rat
brain
.

Intravenous
administration
of
m
-
chloro
-
phenylpiperazine
(
mCPP
)
(
0
.
25
or
2
.
5
mg
/
kg
)
induced
a
marked
and
dose
-
related
increase
in
extracellular
concentrations
of
serotonin
in
hippocampus
(
300
-
1
,
400
%
of
baseline
)
as
measured
using
in
vivo
microdialysis
in
awake
male
Wistar
rats
of
the
spontaneously
hypertensive
(
SH
)
strain
.

Indicating
that
the
effect
of
mCPP
was
caused
by
a
reversal
of
the
serotonin
transporter
,
it
was
antagonized
by
pretreatment
with
the
serotonin
re
-
uptake
inhibitor
citalopram
(
10
mg
/
kg
)
but
was
unaffected
by
local
administration
of
the
sodium
channel
blocker
tetrodotoxin
(
TTX
;
1
microns
)
.

mCPP
was
also
shown
to
induce
an
increase
in
extracellular
concentrations
of
dopamine
in
the
nucleus
accumbens
and
the
striatum
of
SH
rats
and
in
the
nucleus
accumbens
of
rats
of
the
Sprague
-
Dawley
(
SD
)
strain
;
this
effect
of
mCPP
was
,
however
,
much
weaker
(
125
-
170
%
of
baseline
)
than
the
effect
on
serotonin
;
moreover
,
it
seems
to
be
TTX
-
sensitive
.

In
anesthetized
SD
rats
,
mCPP
induced
a
moderate
reduction
of
nigral
dopamine
cell
firing
rate
;
supporting
the
assumption
that
this
effect
is
secondary
to
the
observed
increase
in
dopamine
release
,
it
was
blocked
by
pretreatment
either
with
the
dopamine
synthesis
inhibitor
alpha
-
methyl
-
para
-
tyrosine
or
with
the
dopamine
D2
receptor
antagonist
haloperidol
.

In
conclusion
,
the
results
suggest
that
mCPP
induces
a
marked
,
TTX
-
insensitive
increase
in
serotonin
release
in
rat
brain
,
but
only
a
modest
and
TTX
-
sensitive
increase
in
the
extracellular
levels
of
dopamine
.

revealed
that

Participation
of
beta

adrenergic
receptors
on
macrophages
in
modulation
of
LPS
-
induced
cytokine
release
.

For
several
years
it
is
known
that
beta
-
adrenergic
receptor
agonists
have
anti
-
inflammatory
effects
.

However
,
little
is
known
about
the
role
of
beta
-
adrenergic
receptors
on
macrophages
in
the
modulation
of
cytokine
production
by
beta
-
agonists
during
inflammation
.

In
this
study
,
the
presence
of
beta
-
receptors
on
PMA
-
differentiated
U937
human
macrophages
,
and
the
participation
of
these
receptors
in
the
modulation
of
LPS
-
mediated
cytokine
production
by
beta
-
agonists
was
investigated
.

Total
beta
-
receptor
expression
on
undifferentiated
(
monocyte
)
and
PMA
-
differentiated
U937
cells
was
established
using
receptor
binding
studies
on
membrane
fractions
with
a
radio
ligand
.

The
expression
of
beta
-
receptors
proved
to
be
significantly
lower
on
monocytes
than
on
macrophages
,
additionally
a
predominant
expression
of
beta
2
-
receptors
was
found
.

Production

,
and
IL

by
LPS

U937
cells
was
measured
in
time
.

Peak
concentrations
for
TNF

alpha
,
IL
-
6
and
IL
-
10
occurred
at
3
,
12
and
9
hrs
,
respectively
.

When
differentiated
U937
cells
were
incubated
with
both
LPS
and
the
beta
-
agonist
clenbuterol
the
production
of
TNF
-
alpha
and
IL
-
6
was
significantly
reduced
.

However
the
production
of
IL
-
10
was
increased
.

To
study
the
mechanism
of
modulation
of
cytokine
production
in
more
detail
,
U937
macrophages
were
incubated
with
LPS
/
clenbuterol
in
combination
with
selective
beta
1
-
and
beta
2
-
antagonists
.

These
results
indicated
that
the
beta
2

and
not
the
beta

receptor
is
involved
in
the
anti
-
inflammatory
activity
of
clenbuterol
.

Androgen

In

observed

Exposure

The

resulted
in

Determinants

-
epoxide
in

We
have
used

,
based
on
the
crystal
structure
of
the
human
glutathione

(
GST
)

dimensional
structures
of
rat
GSTA3
and
rat
GSTA5
subunits
bound
to

aflatoxinyl
-
glutathione
.

The
resulting
models
highlight
two
residues
,
at
positions
208
and
108
,
that
could
be
important
for
determining
,
either
directly
or
indirectly
,
substrate
specificity
for
aflatoxin
-
exo

Residues
at
these

were

:

These
studies
show
clearly
that
,
in
all
three
GSTs
,
an
aspartate
residue
at
position
208
is
a
prerequisite
for

this
alone

;
other

are
important

Static
Laue
diffraction
studies
on
acetylcholinesterase
.

Acetylcholinesterase
(
AChE
)
is
one
of
nature
'
s
fastest
enzymes
,
despite
the
fact
that
its
three
-
dimensional
structure
reveals
its
active
site
to
be
deeply
sequestered
within
the
molecule
.

This
raises
questions
with
respect
to
traffic
of
substrate
to
,
and
products
from
,
the
active
site
,
which
may
be
investigated
by
time
-
resolved
crystallography
.

In
order
to
address
one
aspect
of
the
feasibility
of
performing
time
-
resolved
studies
on
AChE
,
a
data
set
has
been
collected
using
the
Laue
technique
on
a
trigonal

of
Torpedo

AChE
soaked
with
the
reversible

edrophonium
,
using
a

Electron

obtained
from
the
Laue
data
,
which
are
of
surprisingly
good
quality
compared
with
similar
maps
from
monochromatic
data
,
show
essentially
the
same
features
.

They
clearly
reveal
the

as
a

YAP1
confers
resistance
to
the
fatty
acid
synthase
inhibitor
cerulenin
through
the
transporter
Flr1p
in
Saccharomyces
cerevisiae
.

In
this
study
,
we
utilized
a
genetic
approach
to
identify
genes
which
render
yeast
cells
resistant
to
cerulenin
(
Cer
)
,
a
potent
and
noncompetitive
inhibitor
of
fatty
acid
synthase
(
FAS
)
.

Overexpression
of
the
yeast
transcription
factor
Yap1p
was
found
to
confer
Cer
resistance
(
CerR
)
.

This
resistance
was
shown
to
be
less
pronounced
in
a
strain
deleted
for
YCF1
,
a
multidrug
resistance
ABC
transporter
,
supporting
previous
observations
that
implicated
YCF1
in
mediating
CerR
.

However
,
isolation
of
YAP1
as
a
high
-
copy
CerR
gene
in
a
ycf1delta
strain
suggested
that
YAP1
-
induced
CerR
was
mediated
by
additional
downstream
effectors
.

Overexpression
of
neither
glutathione
reductase
nor
a
predicted
aryl
alcohol
dehydrogenase
(
the
products
of
two
YAP1
-
regulated
genes
involved
in
detoxification
)
conferred
CerR
.

Overexpression
of
ATR1
,
another
YAP1
-
regulated
gene
previously
implicated
in
conferring
resistance
to
a
number
of
cytotoxic
drugs
,
was
also
incapable
of
making
cells
resistant
to
Cer
.

In
contrast
,
overexpression
of
Flr1p
,
a
yeast
transporter
of
the
major
facilitator
superfamily
which
is
also
under
the
control
of
YAP1
,
was
sufficient
to
confer
CerR
in
an
otherwise
wild
-
type
background
.

Moreover
,
CerR
was
markedly
diminished
in
a
strain
deleted
for
FLR1
.

These
findings
implicate
members
of
both
of
the
transporter
superfamilies
involved
in
multiple
drug
resistance
(
MDR
)
in
the
acquisition
of
CerR
in
yeast
.

Furthermore
,
our
studies
indicate
that
yeast
may
be
a
useful
model
system
in
which

Mortality
risk
in
men
is
associated
with
a
common
mutation
in
the
methylene
-
tetrahydrofolate
reductase
gene
(
MTHFR
)
.

An
elevated
level
of
homocysteine
in
plasma
is
associated
with
the
occurrence
of
cardiovascular
disease
.

A
common
ala
-
to
-
val
mutation
in
the
methylenetetrahydrofolate
reductase
gene
(
MTHFR
)
is
associated
with
an
elevated
level
of
plasma
homocysteine
.

We
studied
the
possible
detrimental
effects
of
the
MTHFR
mutation
on
mortality
.

Within
a
population
-
based
study
in
the
city
of
Leiden
,
the
Netherlands
,
we
first
compared
the
MTHFR
genotype
distribution
among
365
elderly
subjects
aged
85
years
and
over
born
in
Leiden
,
and
250
young
subjects
aged
18
to
40
years
whose
families
originated
from
the
same
geographical
region
.

Second
,
the
complete
cohort
of
666
subjects
aged
85
years
and
over
was
followed
over
a
period
of
10
years
for
all
-
cause
and
cause
-
specific
mortality
and
stratified
according
to
MTHFR
genotype
.

The
frequency
of
the
MTHFR
mutation
was
significantly
lower
in
the
elderly
than
in
the
young
(
0
.
30
and
0
.
36
,
respectively
;
P
=
0
.
03
)
.

The
difference
in
genotype
distribution
was
only
present
in
men
.

The
estimated
mortality
risk
up
to
85
years
in
men
carrying
the
vallval
genotype
was
3
.
7
(
95
%
confidence
interval
(
CI
)
,
1
.
3
-
10
.
9
)
.

Over
the
age
of
85
,
mortality
in
men
with
the
vallval
genotype
was
increased
2
.
0
-
fold
(
95
%
CI
,
1
.
1
-
3
.
9
)
and
appeared
to
be
attributable
to
cancer
rather
than
cardiovascular
causes
of
death
.

Among
women
aged
85
years
and
over
,
no
deleterious
effect
of
the
MTHFR
mutation
was
observed
.

In
conclusion
,
the
MTHFR
mutation
is
associated
with
increased
mortality
in
men
in
middle
and
old
age
,
but
not
in
women
.

The
NDUFA1
gene
product
(
MWFE
protein
)
is
essential
for
activity
of
complex
I
in
mammalian
mitochondria
.

The
MWFE
polypeptide
of
mammalian
complex
I
(
the
proton
-
translocating
NADH
-
quinone
oxidoreductase
)
is
70
amino
acids
long
,
and
it
is
predicted
to
be
a
membrane
protein
.

The
NDUFA1
gene
encoding
the
MWFE
polypeptide
is
located
on
the
X
chromosome
.

This
polypeptide
is
1
of
approximately
28
"
accessory
proteins
"
identified
in
complex
I
,
which
is
composed
of
42
unlike
subunits
.

It
was
considered
accessory
,
because
it
is
not
one
of
the
14
polypeptides
making
up
the
core
complex
I
;
a
homologous
set
of
14
polypeptides
can
make
a
fully
functional
proton
-
translocating
NADH
-
quinone
oxidoreductase
in
prokaryotes
.

One
MWFE
mutant
has
been
identified
and
isolated
from
a
collection
of
respiration
-
deficient
Chinese
hamster
cell
mutants
.

The
CCL16
-
B2
mutant
has
suffered
a
deletion
that
would
produce
a
truncated
and
abnormal
MWFE
protein
.

In
these
mutant
cells
,
complex
I
activity
is
reduced
severely
(
<
10
%
)
.

Complementation
with
hamster
NDUFA1
cDNA
restored
the
rotenone
-
sensitive
complex
I
activity
of
these
mutant
cells
to
approximately
100
%
of
the
parent
cell
activity
.

Thus
,
it
is
established
that
the
MWFE
polypeptide
is
absolutely
essential
for
an
active
complex
I
in
mammals
.

Synthesis
of
thrombin
-
inhibiting
heparin
mimetics
without
side
effects
.

Unwanted
side
effects
of
pharmacologically
active
compounds
can
usually
be
eliminated
by
structural
modifications
.

But
the
complex
heterogeneous
structure
of
the
polysaccharide
heparin
has
limited
this
approach
to
fragmentation
,
leading
to
slightly
better
-
tolerated
heparin
preparations
of
low
molecular
mass
.

Despite
this
improvement
,
heparin
-
induced
thrombocytopaenia
(
HIT
)
,
related
to
an
interaction
with
platelet
factor
4
(
PF4
)
and
,
to
a
lesser
extent
,
haemorrhages
,
remain
significant
side
effects
of
heparinotherapy
.

Breakthroughs
in
oligosaccharide
chemistry
made
possible
the
total
synthesis
of
the
pentasaccharide
antithrombin
-
binding
site
of
heparin
.

This
pentasaccharide
represents
a
new
family
of
potential
antithrombotic
drugs
,
devoid
of
thrombin
inhibitory
properties
,
and
free
of
undesired
interactions
with
blood
and
vessel
components
.

To
obtain
more
potent
and
well
-
tolerated
antithrombotic
drugs
,
we
wished
to
synthesize
heparin
mimetics
able
to
inhibit
thrombin
,
that
is
,
longer
oligosaccharides
.

Like
thrombin
inhibition
,
undesired
interactions
are
directly
correlated
to
the
charge
and
the
size
of
the
molecules
,
so
we
had
to
design
structures
that
were
able
to
discriminate
between
thrombin
and
other
proteins
,
particularly
PF4
.

Here
we
describe
the
use
of
multistep
converging
synthesis
to
obtain
sulphated
oligosaccharides
that
meet
these
requirements
.

Effects
of
candesartan
and
cilazapril
on
rats
with
myocardial
infarction
assessed
by
echocardiography
.

The
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
compare
the
angiotensin
II
type
1
receptor
antagonist
candesartan
cilexitil
(
candesartan
)
and
the
angiotensin
-
converting
enzyme
inhibitor
cilazapril
on
cardiac
function
,
assessed
by
Doppler
echocardiography
and
cardiac
gene
expression
associated
with
cardiac
remodeling
,
in
rats
with
myocardial
infarction
.

Candesartan
or
cilazapril
was
administered
after
myocardial
infarction
.

At
1
and
4
weeks
after
myocardial
infarction
,
cardiac
function
and
mRNA
expression
in
noninfarcted
myocardium
were
analyzed
.

Candesartan
and
cilazapril
equally
prevented
increases
in
hypertrophy
in
noninfarcted
myocardium
,
left
ventricular
dilatation
,
and
ejection
fraction
at
4
weeks
.

The
E

ratio
and
the
rate
of

of

,
increased

at
1

after
myocardial
infarction
.

Candesartan
and
cilazapril
,
administered
at
a
dose
of
1
mg
/
kg
per
day
,
prevented
increases
in
E
-
wave
/
A
-
wave
velocity
ratio
and
E
-
wave
deceleration
at
1
and
4
weeks
.

Candesartan
and
cilazapril
significantly
suppressed
increased
mRNA
expression
of
beta
-
myosin
heavy
chain
,
alpha
-
skeletal
actin
,
and
atrial
natriuretic
peptide
in
noninfarcted
ventricle
at
1
and
4
weeks
and
expression
of
collagen
I
and
III
at
4
weeks
to
a
similar
extent
.

When
given
at
a
dose
of
10
mg
/
kg
per
day
,
both
candesartan
and
cilazapril
prevented
cardiac
dysfunction
and
gene
expression
to
the
same
extent
as
when
given
at
1
mg
/
kg
per
day
.

In
conclusion
,
Doppler
echocardiography
showed
that
candesartan
and
cilazapril
equally
improved
systolic
and
diastolic
function
and
that
ventricular
remodeling
accompanied
modulation
of
cardiac
gene
expression
.

Genetic
causes
of
mild
hyperhomocysteinemia
in
patients
with
premature
occlusive
coronary
artery
diseases
.

Elevated
plasma
homocysteine
is
increasingly
being
recognized
as
a
risk
factor
for
coronary
artery
disease
(
CAD
)
.

Although
there
is
general
agreement
on
the
importance
of
micronutrients
and
genetic
predisposition
to
elevated
plasma
homocysteine
,
the
exact
influence
of
the
known
prevalent
mutations
in
genes
which
regulate
homocysteine
metabolism
is
not
clear
.

We
studied
376
cases
of
individuals
with
premature
CAD
with
respect
to
their
fasting
and
post
-
methionine
load
(
PML
)
total
homocysteine
(
tHcy
)
concentrations
.

We
also
determined
the
presence
or
absence
of
the
T833C
and
G919A
mutations
of
the
cystathionine
-
beta
-
synthase
(
CBS
)
gene
,
the
C677T
mutation
of
the
methylene
tetrahydrofolate
reductase
(
MTHFR
)
gene
,
and
the
A2756G
transition
of
the
B12
dependent
methionine
synthase
(
MS
)
gene
.

Our
objectives
were
therefore
both
to
confirm
the
relationship
of
plasma
homocysteine
with
premature
CAD
and
to
examine
the
importance
of
genetic
influence
on
both
fasting
and
PML
homocysteine
.

Approximately
32
%
of
the
CAD
patients
had
fasting
hyperhomocysteinemia
and
16
%
had
PML
hyperhomocysteinemia
.

Of
these
,
8
.
5
%
had
both
forms
of
hyperhomocysteinemia
(
combined
hyperhomocysteinemia
)
.

The
T133C
mutation
in
the
CBS
gene
and
the
thermolabile
C677T
mutation
in
the
MTHFR
gene
seem
to
play
an
important
role
in
the
subset
of
individuals
with
combined
hyperhomocysteinemia
.

The
A2756G
transition
in
the
MS
gene
is
not
associated
with
elevated
plasma
tHcy
.

Many
cases
(
47
%
)
of
hyperhomocysteinemia
are
not
associated
with
micronutrient
deficiencies
,
impaired
renal
function
,
and
/
or
currently
known
genetic
mutations
.

Further
work
is
needed
to
study
whether
unknown
mutations
,
particularly
those
residing
in
the
intronic
sequences
of
the
genes
involved
in
homocysteine
metabolism
,
other
environmental
factors
,
or
interaction
of
gene
,
nutrient
,
and
environmental
factors
may
be
the
cause
of
currently
unexplained
cases
of
mild
hyperhomocysteinemia
.

Effects
of
bis
(
7
)
-
tacrine
,
a
novel
anti
-
Alzheimer
'
s
agent
,
on
rat
brain
AChE
.

The
anticholinesterase
effects
of
bis
(
7
)
-
tacrine
were
compared
with
tacrine
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
.

Based
on
IC50
ratios
,
the
dimeric
analog
bis
(
7
)
-
tacrine
was
,
in
a
reversible
manner
,
up
to
150
-
fold
more
potent
and
250
-
fold
more
selective
than
tacrine
for
acetylcholinesterase
(
AChE
)
over
butyrylcholinesterase
(
BChE
)
.

Following
a
single
oral
administration
,
both
bis
(
7
)
-
tacrine
and
tacrine
produced
dose
-
dependent
inhibitions
of
AChE
in
rat
brain
,
but
bis
(
7
)
-
tacrine
exhibited
higher
efficacy
and
AChE
/
BChE
selectivity
than
tacrine
.

The
anti
-
AChE
efficacy
of
bis
(
7
)
-
tacrine
was
quite
similar
following
an
oral
or
i
.
p
.
administration
,
but
tacrine
showed
much
lower
efficacy
when
administered
orally
than
when
given
i
.
p
.

These
findings
suggest
bis
(
7
)
-
tacrine
,
a
highly
potent
and
selective
inhibitor
of
AChE
,
can
probably
be
used
as
an
improved
drug
in
the
palliative
treatment
of
AD
.

Fibroblast
growth
factor

10
.

A
second
candidate
stromal
to
epithelial
cell
andromedin
in
prostate
.

Fibroblast
growth
factor
(
FGF
)
-
10
,
a
homologue
of
FGF
-
7
,
is
expressed
significantly
in
normal
rat
prostate
tissue
,
well
differentiated
rat
prostate
tumors
with
an
epithelial
and
stromal
compartment
and
only
in
derived
prostate
stromal
cells
in
culture
.

Similar
to
FGF
-
7
,
recombinant
rat
FGF
-
10
was
a
specific
mitogen
for
prostate
epithelial
cells
.

In
contrast
to
FGF
-
7
which
is
widely
expressed
among
stromal
cells
in
tissues
,
the
expression
of
FGF
-
10
correlated
with
the
presence
of
stromal
cells
of
muscle
origin
.

Radioreceptor
binding
assays
and
covalent
cross
-
linking
analysis
revealed
that
FGF
-
10
binds
with
an
affinity
equal
to
FGF
-
7
to
resident
epithelial
cell
receptor
,
FGFR2IIIb
,
but
unlike
FGF
-
7
also
binds
the
IIIb
splice
variant
of
FGFR1
.

Analysis
of
mRNA
expression
by
RNase
protection
revealed
that
,
similar
to
FGF
-
7
,
the
expression
of
FGF
-
10
was
responsive
to
androgen
in
stromal
cells
from
normal
prostate
and
non
-
malignant
differentiated
tumors
.

Although
FGF
-
10
cDNA
exhibits
a
signal
sequence
for
secretion
,
cultured
stromal
cells
exhibit
strictly
a
cell
-
associated
FGF
-
10
antigen
that
correlates
with
an
alternately
translated
intracellular
isoform
.

FGF
-
10
requires
1
.
4
times
higher
NaCl
for
elution
from
immobilized
heparin
than
does
FGF
-
7
and
binds
to
four
times
the
number
of
sites
on
the
pericellular
matrix
of
epithelial
cells
.

The
results
show
that
prostate
stromal
cell
-
derived
FGF
-
10
,
like
FGF
-
7
,
exhibits
the
properties
of
an
andromedin
which
may
indirectly
mediate
control
of
epithelial
cell
growth
and
function
by
androgen
.

Although
FGF
-
10
and
FGF
-
7
bind
and
activate
the
same
resident
epithelial
cell
receptor
(
FGFR2IIIb
)
,
differences
in
cell
type
of
origin
,
compartmentation
by
alternate
translation
,
the
affinity
for
FGFR1IIIb
,
and
access
to
FGFR
by
differential
interaction
with
pericellular
matrix
heparan
sulfate
suggest
they
may
play
both
independent
and
compensatory
roles
in
prostate
homeostasis
.

Pre

The
present
study
investigated
the
effect
of
buspirone
on
memory
formation
in
an
aversive

task
.

Male
Wistar
rats
were
trained
on
the

and
tested
for

They
received
peripheral

amygdala
administration
of
buspirone
or
other
5

HT1A
drugs
either
before
or
after

.

Results
indicated
that
pretraining
systemic
injections
of
buspirone
caused
a

.

0

had

and
1

.

Post

of
the
drug
caused
a
time

deficit
,
which
was
not
due

.

When
training
in
the
inhibitory
avoidance
task
was
divided
into
a
context

and
a

-
training
phase
,
buspirone
impaired

only
when

,
suggesting
that
the

influenced

These

through

Selective

of
cyclooxygenase
2
spares
renal
function
and

in
cirrhotic
rats

BACKGROUND
&
AIMS
:
The
critical
role
of
cyclooxygenase
(
COX
)
products
in
maintenance
of
renal
function
in
cirrhosis
with
ascites
discourages
the
use
of
nonsteroidal
anti
-
inflammatory
drugs
in
this
disease
.

The
recent
development
of
selective
COX
-
2
inhibitors
opens
new
avenues
for
the
use
of
these
compounds
in
decompensated

.

The
current

evaluates
the
effects
of
a

Protocol
2
was
aimed
at
assessing
the
effects
of
COX
inhibitors
on
renal
water
metabolism
in
28
cirrhotic
rats
.

RESULTS
:
Administration
of
SC
-
236
to
cirrhotic
animals
did
not
produce
significant
renal
effects
,
whereas
administration
of
the
nonselective
COX
-

/
COX
-
2
inhibitor
,
ketorolac
,
resulted
in
a
marked
reduction
in
urine
volume
,
urinary
excretion
of
prostaglandins
,
and
glomerular
filtration
rate
and
in
a
significant
impairment
in
renal
water
metabolism
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
These
findings
indicate
that
SC
-
236
does
not
significantly
impair
renal
function
in
rats
with
cirrhosis
.

[
Pharmacodynamic
and
pharmacokinetic
aspects
of
the
non
-
inflammatory
non
-
steroidal
agent
meloxicam
in
dogs
]
.

The
pharmacodynamics
of
non
-
steroidal
anti
-
inflammatory
drugs
(
NSAIDs
)
are
for
the
most
part
well
-
understood
.

All
NSAIDs
inhibit
the
enzyme
cyclooxygenase
(
COX
)
,
and
for
this
reason
prostaglandin
synthesis
.

Two
isoforms
of
COX
could
be
isolated
.

COX
-
1
is
detectable
in
most
tissues
on
a
constant
level
and
is
responsible
for
the
synthesis
of
prostaglandins
with
cytoprotective
effects
.

COX
-
2
is
induced
through
inflammation
and
supports
the
inflammatory
process
by
producing
pro
-
inflammatory
prostaglandins
.

The
desired
effects
of
NSAIDs
are
related
to
inhibition
of
COX
-
2
,
whereas
inhibition
of
COX
-
1
has
been
linked
to
the
typical
side
-
effects
of
NSAIDs
,
especially
in
the
stomach
and
kidney
.

The
great
differences
between
effects
and
side
-
effects
in
the
numerous
substances
can
be
explained
because
of
different
interactions
of
the
NSAIDs
on
COX
-
1
and
COX
-
2
.

In
various
test
systems
meloxicam
has
been
shown
to
be
a
preferential
inhibitor
of
COX
-
2
.

There
are
also
large
differences
between
the
individual
NSAIDs
with
regard
to
pharmacokinetics
.

Meloxicam
is
completely
absorbed
from
the
gastrointestinal
tract
and
has
an
elimination
half
-
life
of
24
hours
in
the
dog
.

It
is
excreted
in
faeces
and
urine
.

The
metabolites
,
detectable
in
urine
are
biologically
inactive
and
do
not
influence
the
prostaglandin
synthesis
in
the
kidney
.

In
the
underlying
study
,
plasma
concentration
of
meloxicam
was
determined
after
a
subcutaneous
injection
of
0
.
2
mg
/
kg
b
.

w
.

(
day
1
)
followed
by
oral
treatment
of
0
.
1
mg
/
kg
b
.

w
.

(
days
2
-
14
)
.

The
results
confirm
the
recommended
dosage
regime
of
meloxicam
with
its
initial
loading
dose
and
the
subsequent
maintenance
dose
.

This
dosing
regime
results
in
a
very
favourable
curve
of
concentrations
with
a
very
rapidly
attained
steady
state
after
roughly
two
days
,
without
accumulation
even
in
long
-
term
treatment
.

An

to

is
inactivation
by
beta

)
.

The
evolution
of
the

(

)
is
associated
with
extensive
use
of

,
and
is
a
serious
threat
to

In

,
this

was
associated
with
high

When

increasing
the

,
the

increased

.

By
comparison
,
similar
observations
were
made
with
meropenem
while
imipenem
MICs
were
usually
less
affected
.

Not
surprisingly
,
MIC
increases
with

beta

lactams
were
generally
substantially
greater
,
resulting
in
resistance
in
many

Molecular

.

A
cDNA
encoding
the

family
,
OAT3
,
was
isolated
by
the
reverse

method
.

Degenerate
primers
were
designed
based
on
the
sequences
conserved
among
OAT1
,

,
and
organic
cation
transporter

(

)
,
and
reverse
transcription
-
polymerase
chain
reaction
was
performed
using
rat

.

The
536

protein
sequence
encoded
by
OAT3
showed
49
,
39
,
and
36
%
identity
to
those
of
OAT1
,
OAT2
,
and
OCT1
,
respectively
.

Northern

analysis
revealed
that
rat
OAT3
mRNA
is
expressed
in
the
liver
,
brain
,
kidney
,
and
eye
.

When
expressed
in
Xenopus

,
OAT3
mediated

.

Organic
cations
such
as

not
interact
with

.

Acidic

derived
from
dopamine
,
epinephrine
,

inhibited
the

These
results
suggest
an

of
OAT3
in
the

of
endogenous

Influence
of
halothane
on
phospholipase
A2
and
enzymatic
methylations
in
the
rat
retinal
membranes
.

Phospholipase
A2
(
PLA2
)
and
phospholipid
methylases
(
PLM
)
play
significant
roles
in
transmitter
release
and
membrane
signal
transduction
,
respectively
.

Previous
studies
have
indicated
that
PLMs
occur
in
the
rat
brain
synaptosomal
and
retinal
membranes
,
and
they
are
activated
under
halothane
anesthesia
.

The
influence
of
halothane
on
PLA2
is
not
known
.

Therefore
,
we
have
investigated
the
effect
of
halothane
on
retinal
PLA2
activity
.

Rat
retinal
sonicates
were
assayed
for
PLA2
activity
using
1
-
palmitoyl

[

14C

arachidonyl

phosphatidylethanolamine
(

in

at
37
degrees

with
and
without
halothane
(
0
.
25
-

.
0
mM
)
in
the
assay
medium
.

These
studies
gave
the
following
results
:
(

)
Rat
retinal
sonicates
contained
PLA2
activity
of
4
.

;
(

)
Halothane
(
0

25

2
.
0
mM
)
increased
PLA2
activity
by
20
to
150
%
depending
upon
concentration
;
(
3
)
The
lower
concentration
of
halothane
(
0
.
25
mM
)
exhibited
high
activation
of
PLA2
(
150
%
)
;
(
4
)
High
concentrations
of
halothane
(
1
.
0
-
2
.
0
mM
)
caused
a
low
degree
of
activation
of
PLA2
(
20
%
)
;
and
(
5
)
During
phospholipid
methylation
of
retinal
membranes
with
S
-
adenosyl
-
L
-
methionine
in
the
presence
of
halothane
,
increased
amounts
of
fatty
acid
methyl
esters
(
FAME
)
were
formed
.

This
increase
in
FAME
(
45
%
)
was
possibly
due
to
the
hydrolysis
of
phospholipids
by
activated
PLA2
,
liberating
fatty
acids
which
were
methylated
.

This
increase
in
FAME
(
45
%
)
was
inhibited
by
mepacrine
(
quinacrine
)
(
10
microM
)
,
an
inhibitor
of
PLA2
.

These
observations
suggest
that
the
release
of
retinal
transmitters
(
dopamine
,
acetylcholine
and
others
)
is
affected
during
halothane
anesthesia
,
due
to
activation
of
PLA2
and
enhanced
fusogenic
activity
of
vesicular
membranes
with
plasma
membrane
and
depletion
of
vesicles
.

Atypical

,
and

.

Insulin
-
like
growth
factor
(
IGF
)
-
II
is
a
potent
growth
factor
,
normally
controlled
by
a
number
of
other
factors
,
including
IGF
binding
proteins
and
IGF
binding
protein
proteases
.

In
general
,
the
latter
increase
the
bioavailability
of
IGF
by
cleaving
IGF
binding
proteins
.

Cathepsin
D
(
an
IGF
binding
protein
protease
)
was
also
implicated
in
tumor
invasion
.

Although
IGF
-
II
was
implicated
in
the
pathogeneses
of
various
childhood
neoplasms
,
its
significance
in
the
pathogenesis
of
atypical
teratoid
/
rhabdoid
tumor
of
the
central
nervous
system
(
ATRT
-
CNS
)
was
not
studied
to
date
.

We
present
clinicopathologic
features
of
two
cases
of
ATRT
-
CNS
.

In
addition
,
formalin

fixed
,
paraffin
-
embedded
tissue
sections
were
stained
immunohistochemically
for
IGF
-
II
,
IGF
receptor
type
1
,
cathepsin
D
,
and
Ki
-
67
.

Both
tumors
demonstrated
diffuse
strong
cytoplasmic
positivity
for
IGF
-
II
,
diffuse
cytoplasmic
and
focal
membranous
positivity
for
IGF
receptor
type
I
,
and
diffuse
cytoplasmic
positivity
for
cathepsin
D
.

The
Ki
-
67
labeling
indices
were
10
.
0
%
and
1
.
4
%
.

We
conclude
that
ATRT
-
CNS
cells
express
both
IGF
-
II
and
IGF
receptor
type
1
,
supporting
the
hypothesis
that
autocrine
/
paracrine
stimulation
of
cell
growth
by
IGF
-
II
might
be
one
mechanism
involved
in
ATRT
-
CNS
tumorigenesis
.

Cathepsin
D
expressed
by
the
tumor
cells
might
also
be
involved
in
both
tumor
cell
invasion
and
growth
.

The
exact
pathogenesis
of
ATRT

CNS
remains
to
be
elucidated
.

Is
phentermine
an
inhibitor
of
monoamine
oxidase
?

A
critical
appraisal
.

Phentermine
produces
a
spectrum
of
concentration
-
dependent
biochemical
effects
.

It
interacts
with
NE
transporters
at
0
.
1
microM
,
DA
transporters
at
about
1
microM
,
5
-
HT
transporters
at
15
microM
and
MAO
-
A
at
about
100
microM
.

When
administered
at
typical
anorectic
doses
,
phentermine
primarily
interacts
with
DA
and
NE
transporters
and
does
not
produce
biochemical
or
neurochemical
effects
which
would
occur
if
it
were
inhibiting
MAO
-
A
.

Some
other
explanation
other
than
MAO
inhibition
must
be
sought
to
explain
how
oral
phentermine
increases
platelet
5
-
HT
,
since
platelet
MAO
-
B
does
not
metabolize
platelet
5
-
HT
,
and
since
amphetamine
-
type
drugs
are
even
weaker
inhibitors
of
MAO
-
B
than
MAO
-
A
.

Clinical
studies
in
humans
have
shown
that
amphetamine
,
which
is
a
more
potent
inhibitor
of
MAO
-
A
than
phentermine
,
does
not
inhibit
MAO
-
A
at
therapeutic
doses
.

Neither
phentermine
alone
,
fluoxetine
alone
or
their
combined
use
have
been
associated
with
cardiac
valvulopathy
,
and
clinical
experience
has
shown
their
combined
use
to
be
free
of
significant
adverse
effects
.

Viewed
collectively
,
there
appears
to
be
no
data
to
support
the
hypothesis
that
phentermine
inhibits
MAO
at
typical
therapeutic
doses
.

Identification
of
a
nuclear
receptor
for
bile
acids
.

Bile
acids
are
essential
for
the
solubilization
and
transport
of
dietary
lipids
and
are
the
major
products
of
cholesterol
catabolism
.

Results
presented
here
show
that
bile
acids
are
physiological
ligands
for
the
farnesoid
X
receptor
(
FXR
)
,
an
orphan
nuclear
receptor
.

When
bound
to
bile
acids
,
FXR
repressed
transcription
of
the
gene
encoding
cholesterol
7alpha
-
hydroxylase
,
which
is
the
rate
-
limiting
enzyme
in
bile
acid
synthesis
,
and
activated
the
gene
encoding
intestinal
bile
acid
-
binding
protein
,
which
is
a
candidate
bile
acid
transporter
.

These
results
demonstrate
a
mechanism
by
which
bile
acids
transcriptionally
regulate
their
biosynthesis
and
enterohepatic
transport
.

substantial
at
48
h
for
eosinophils
treated
with

)
10
M
FP
,
and
inhibition
of
LTC4
synthesis
was
reversed
by
exogenous
arachidonic
acid
(
AA
)
.

We
find
that
FP
causes
a
decrease
in
stimulated
eosinophil
secretion
of
LTC4
that
is
regulated
by
phospholipase
A2
(
PLA2
)
.

Inhibition
of
LTC4
synthesis
precedes
the
global
cytotoxic
effects
of
FP
as
indicated
by
the
simultaneous
upregulation
of
annexin
-
1
expression
.

Inhibited
stimulated
secretion
corresponds
to
inhibited
translocation
of
cPLA2
to
the
nuclear
envelope
during
cellular
activation
.

Hyperammonemia
:
regulation
of
argininosuccinate
synthetase
and
argininosuccinate
lyase
genes
in
aggregating
cell
cultures
of
fetal
rat
brain
.

Hyperammonemia
in
the
brain
leads
to
poorly
understood
alterations
of
nitric
oxide
(
NO
)
synthesis
.

Arginine
,
the
substrate
of
nitric
oxide
synthases
,
might
be
recycled
from
the
citrulline
produced
with
NO
by
argininosuccinate
synthetase
(
AS
)
and
argininosuccinate
lyase
(
AL
)
.

The
regulation
of
AS
and
AL
genes
during
hyperammonemia
is
unknown
in
the
brain
.

We
used
brain
cell
aggregates
cultured
from
dissociated
telencephalic
cortex
of
rat
embryos
to
analyze
the
regulation
of
AS
and
AL
genes
in
hyperammonemia
.

Using
RNase
protection
assay
and
non
-
radioactive
in
situ
hybridization
on
aggregate
cryosections
,
we
show
that
both
AS
and
AL
genes
are
induced
in
astrocytes
but
not
in
neurons
of
aggregates
exposed
to
5
mM
NH4Cl
.

Our
work
suggests
that
the
hyperammonemic
brain
might
increase
its
recycling
of
citrulline
to
arginine
.

Reduced
satiating
effect
of
d
-
fenfluramine
in
serotonin
5
-
HT
(
2C
)
receptor
mutant
mice
.

RATIONALE
:
d
-
Fenfluramine
stimulates
the
release
of
serotonin
(
5
-
HT
)
and
is
a
potent
inhibitor
of
the
re
-
uptake
of
5
-
HT
into
nerve
terminals
.

Administration
of
d
-
fenfluramine
suppresses
food
intake
in
both
animals
and
humans
.

OBJECTIVE
:
We
have
investigated
the
role
of
the
5
-
HT2C
receptor
in
mediating
the
effect
of
d
-
fenfluramine
on
mouse
food
intake
and
the
behavioural
satiety
sequence
.

METHODS
:
Mutant
mice
lacking
serotonin
5
-
HT2C
receptors
and
wild
-
type
animals
were
habituated
to
a
daily
presentation
of
wet
mash
.

Animals
were
non
-
deprived
and
received
d
-
fenfluramine
(
3
-
30
mg
/
kg
)
30
min
prior
to
being
assessed
for
the
presence
of
stereotypy
and
presented
with
wet
mash
.

The
behaviour
of
animals
was
observed
for
the
subsequent
40
min
and
food
intake
was
recorded
.

RESULTS
:
d
-
Fenfluramine
dose
-
dependently
inhibited
the
consumption
of
a
palatable
wet
mash
by
the
mice
.

d
-
Fenfluramine
(
3
mg
/
kg
)
significantly
reduced
the
amount
of
wet
mash
consumed
by
wild
-
type
mice
and
induced
a
temporal
advance
in
the
behavioural
satiety
sequence
consistent
with
an
enhancement
of
satiety
.

Mutant
mice
were
less
sensitive
to
the
satiating
effects
of
3
mg
/
kg
d
-
fenfluramine
.

Hence
,
this
dose
of
d
-
fenfluramine
had
a
reduced
effect
on
both
food
consumption
and
the
behavioural
satiety
sequence
in
the
5
-
HT2C
mutant
mice
.

In
contrast
,
mutant
mice
showed
an
increased
sensitivity
to
the
stereotypy
induced
by
high
doses
of
d
-
fenfluramine
(
10
,
30
mg
/
kg
)
compared
to
that
of
wild
-
type
littermates
.

CONCLUSION
:
These
data
demonstrate
a
role
for
the
5
-
HT2C
receptor
in
mediating
d
-
fenfluramine
-
induced
satiety
.

Role
of
acetylcholinesterase
(
AChE
)
secreted
by
parasitic
nematodes
on
the
growth
of
the
cell
line
from
epithelial
origin
HT29
-
D4
.

The
excretory
-
secretory
(
E
-
S
)
products
of
the
parasitic
nematodes
Trichostrongylus
colubriformis
and
Nematodirus
battus
were
found
to
modify
the
in
vitro
proliferation
of
the
tumorous
colic
HT29
-
D4
cell
line
of
epithelial
origin
.

A
characteristic
feature
of
these
E
-
S
products
is
the
presence
of
a
high
level
of
acetylcholinesterase
(
AChE
)
activity
,
the
biological
significance
of
which
remains
unclear
.

To
determine
a
possible
role
of
AChE
on
cell
growth
,
the
enzyme
was
purified
from
E
-
S
products
using
edrophonium
chloride
.

Purity
was
confirmed
by
polyacrylamide
gel
electrophoresis
,
using
silver
and
Karnovsky
stains
,
before
assessing
its
effects
on
cell
proliferation
.

The
purified
AChE
was
incorporated
at
different
concentrations
in
a
culture
medium
of
HT29
-
D4
cells
.

A
mitogenic
effect
was
shown
for
low
concentrations
(
0
.
1
-
14
units
)
.

By
contrast
,
an
inhibitory
effect
was
noted
at
high
concentrations
(
35
-
1400
units
)
.

Furthermore
,
polyclonal
antibodies
were
prepared
and
depletion
of
AChE
in
E
-
S
products
by
immunoprecipitation
or
affinity
chromatography
resulted
in
a
partial
or
total
disappearance
of
the
stimulatory
effect
of
cell
growth
.

Thus
,
the
results
form
this
in
vitro
study
suggest
a
modulatory
role
for
AChE
secreted
by
nematode
parasites
on
the
proliferation
of
epithelial
cells
of
the
host
.

Methimazole
and
propylthiouracil
increase
cellular
thyroid
peroxidase
activity
and
thyroid
peroxidase
mRNA
in
cultured
porcine
thyroid
follicles
.

Methimazole
(
MMI
)
and
propylthiouracil
(
PTU
)
are
common
antithyroid
drugs
for
treating
hyperthyroidism
because
the
2
drugs
inhibit
thyroid
peroxidase
(
TPO
)
-
catalyzed
thyroid
hormone
formation
.

We
studied
whether
the
2
drugs
actually
inhibit
cellular
TPO
activity
in
cultured
porcine
follicles
.

Porcine
follicles
were
cultured
in
the
presence
of
1
mU
/
mL
thyrotropin
(
TSH
)
for
7
days
.

Then
follicles
were
exposed
to
MMI
or
PTU
in
the
presence
of
0
.
1
microM
Kl
for
2
days
.

TPO
activity
was
measured
in
the
100
,
000
x
g
-
pellet
of
the
thyroid
sonicate
by
the
guaiacol
oxidation
method
.

Exposure
to
MMI
(
1
microM
and
10
microM
)
or
PTU
(
10
microM
and
100
microM
)
for
2
days
caused
a
significant
increase
in
cellular
TPO
activity
;
100
microM
MMI
inhibited
cellular
TPO
activity
.

The
presence
of
cyclic
adenosine
monophosphate
(
cAMP
)
-
generating
system
(
forskolin
)
in
TSH
-
free
medium
increased
MMI
-
mediated
TPO
activity
.

Cyclohexamide
inhibited
MMI
-
mediated
TPO
activation
,
indicating
that
new
protein
synthesis
is
required
for
increased
TPO
activity
.

Reverse
transcriptase
-
polymerase
chain
reaction
(
RT
-
PCR
)
showed
an
increase
in
TPO
mRNA
by
PTU
or
MMI
.

In
conclusion
,
MMI
and
PTU
at
therapeutic
concentrations
can
increase
TPO
mRNA
and
cellular
TPO
activity
,
although
the
2
drugs
inhibit
the
TPO
-
H2O2
-
mediated
catalytic
reaction
.

Structure
of
acetylcholinesterase
complexed
with
E2020
(
Aricept
)
:
implications
for
the
design
of
new
anti
-
Alzheimer
drugs
.

BACKGROUND
:
Several
cholinesterase
inhibitors
are
either
being
utilized
for
symptomatic
treatment
of
Alzheimer
'
s
disease
or
are
in
advanced
clinical
trials
.

E2020
,
marketed
as
Aricept
,
is
a
member
of
a
large
family
of
N
-
benzylpiperidine
-
based
acetylcholinesterase
(
AChE
)
inhibitors
developed
,
synthesized
and
evaluated
by
the
Eisai
Company
in
Japan
.

These
inhibitors
were
designed
on
the
basis
of
QSAR
studies
,
prior
to
elucidation
of
the
three
-
dimensional
structure
of
Torpedo
californica
AChE
(
TcAChE
)
.

It
significantly
enhances
performance
in
animal
models
of
cholinergic
hypofunction
and
has
a
high
affinity
for
AChE
,
binding
to
both
electric
eel
and
mouse
AChE
in
the
nanomolar
range
.

RESULTS
:
Our
experimental
structure
of
the
E2020
-
TcAChE
complex
pinpoints
specific
interactions
responsible
for
the
high
affinity
and
selectivity
demonstrated
previously
.

It
shows
that
E2020
has
a
unique
orientation
along
the
active
-
site
gorge
,
extending
from
the
anionic
subsite
of
the
active
site
,
at
the
bottom
,
to
the
peripheral
anionic
site
,
at
the
top
,
via
aromatic
stacking
interactions
with
conserved
aromatic
acid
residues
.

E2020
does
not
,
however
,
interact
directly
with
either
the
catalytic
triad
or
the
'
oxyanion
hole
'
,
but
only
indirectly
via
solvent
molecules
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
Our
study
shows
,
a
posteriori
,
that
the
design
of
E2020
took
advantage
of
several
important
features
of
the
active
-
site
gorge
of
AChE
to
produce
a
drug
with
both
high
affinity
for
AChE
and
a
high
degree
of
selectivity
for
AChE
versus
butyrylcholinesterase
(
BChE
)
.

It
also
delineates
voids
within
the
gorge
that
are
not
occupied
by
E2020
and
could
provide
sites
for
potential
modification
of
E2020
to
produce
drugs
with
improved
pharmacological
profiles
.

Maturation
of
neuromuscular
transmission
during
early
development
in
zebrafish
.

We
have
examined
the
rapid
development
of
synaptic
transmission
at
the
neuromuscular
junction
(
NMJ
)
in
zebrafish
embryos
and
larvae
by
patch
-
clamp
recording
of
spontaneous
miniature
endplate
currents
(
mEPCs
)
and
single
acetylcholine
receptor
(
AChR
)
channels
.

Embryonic
(
24
-
36
h
)
mEPCs
recorded
in
vivo
were
small
in
amplitude
(
<
50
pA
)
.

The
rate
of
mEPCs
increased
in
larvae
(
3
.
5
-
fold
increase
measured
by
6
days
)
,
and
these
mEPCs
were
mostly
of
larger
amplitude
(
10
-
fold
on
average
)
with
(
<
/
=
5
-
fold
)
faster
kinetics
.

Intracellular
labeling
with
Lucifer
yellow
indicated
extensive
coupling
between
muscle
cells
in
both
embryos
and
larvae
(
<
/
=
10
days
)
.

Blocking
acetylcholinesterase
(
AChE
)
with
eserine
had
no
effect
on
mEPC
kinetics
in
embryos
at
1
day
and
only
partially
slowed
(
by
approximately
1
/
2
)
the
decay
rate
in
larvae
at
6
days
.

In
acutely
dissociated
muscle
cells
,
we
observed
the
same
two
types
of
AChR
with
conductances
of
45
and
60
pS
and
with
similar
,
brief
(
<
0
.
5
ms
)
mean
open
times
in
both
embryos
and
larvae
.

We
conclude
that
AChR
properties
are
set
early
during
development
at
these
early
stages
;
functional
maturation
of
the
NMJ
is
only
partly
shaped
by
expression
of
AChE
and
may
also
depend
on
postsynaptic
AChR
clustering
and
presynaptic
maturation
.

Multiple
mechanisms
of
action
:
the
pharmacological
profile
of
budipine
.

Four
major
components
of
the
mechanism
of
action
have
been
identified
for
the
antiparkinsonian
drug
budipine
up
to
now
.

1
)
The
primary
action
of
budipine
is
an
indirect
dopaminergic
effect
as
shown
by
facilitation
of
dopamine
(
DA
)
release
,
inhibition
of
monoamine
oxidase
type
B
(
MAO
-
B
)
and
of
DA
(
re
)
up
-
take
and
stimulation
of
aromatic
L
-
amino
acid
decarboxylase
(
AADC
)
,
which
in
sum
might
be
responsible
for
enhancing
the
endogenous
dopaminergic
activity
.

2
)
Radioligand
and
functional
studies
at
the
N
-
methyl
-
D
-
aspartate
(
NMDA
)
type
glutamate
receptor
characterize
budipine
as
a
low
-
affinity
,
uncompetitive
antagonist
with
fast
kinetics
and
moderate
voltage
-
dependency
at
the
phencyclidine
(
PCP
)
binding
site
,
comparable
to
that
observed
with
amantadine
,
thereby
counteracting
an
increased
excitatory
glutamatergic
activity
.

3
)
The
antimuscarinic
action
of
budipine
,
verified
by
functional
and
binding
studies
at
native
muscarinic
M1
-
M3
and
human
recombinant
m1
-
m5
receptor
subtypes
in
vitro
,
is
up
to
125
-
fold
weaker
than
that
of
biperiden
and
corresponds
to
its
approximately
100
-
fold
lower
potency
to
cause
experimentally
-
induced
peripheral
antimuscarinic
effects
and
explains
only
part
of
its
high
potency
,
which
equals
biperiden
,
to
suppress
cholinergically
evoked
tremor
.

4
)
An
additional
inhibition
of
striatal
gamma
-
aminobutyric
acid
(
GABA
)
release
by
budipine
may
be
beneficial
to
suppress
an
increased
striatal
GABAergic
output
activity
.

The
contribution
of
other
observed
effects
to
the
therapeutic
action
of
budipine
,
i
.
e
.
weak
stimulation
of
noradrenaline
and
serotonin
release
,
binding
to
brain
sigma1
receptors
and
blockade
of
histamine
H1
receptors
,
is
not
yet
clear
.

By
means
of
these
multiple
mechanisms
,
budipine
might
correct
the
imbalance
of
striatal
output
pathways
by
restoring
DA
levels
in
the
striatum
,
and
positively
influence
the
secondary
changes
in
other
transmitter
systems
(
glutamate
,
acetylcholine
,
GABA
)
observed
in
Parkinson
'
s
disease
.

Disparate
actions
of
mifepristone
(
RU
486
)
on
glands
and
stroma
in
the
primate
endometrium
.

Besides
being
an
antiprogestin
,
mifepristone
(
RU
486
)
was
recently
shown
to
antagonize
oestrogen
-
dependent
growth
in
the
endometrium
.

To
explore
the
molecular
mechanisms
for
this
phenomenon
,
we
investigated
whether
or
not
the
morphological
effects
of
mifepristone
are
mediated
by
the
progesterone
receptor
(
PR
)
and
whether
mifepristone
has
disparate
effects
on
the
glandular
epithelium
and
stroma
.

Six
groups
of
hypogonadal
,
oestrogen
-
primed
cynomolgus
monkeys
were
treated
for
2
weeks
with
:
vehicle
only
(
group
I
)
;
mifepristone
(
group
II
)
;
mifepristone
plus
progesterone
at
0
.
2
mg
/
kg
(
group
III
)
,
1
.
0
mg
/
kg
(
group
IV
)
or
5
.
0
mg
/
kg
(
group
V
)
;
and
progesterone
only
(
5
.
0
mg
/
kg
)
(
group
VI
)
.

Histomorphological
evaluation
showed
strikingly
compacted
stroma
in
the
mifepristone
-
exposed
endometria
(
group
II
)
,
which
was
partially
reversible
by
additional
progesterone
treatment
(
groups
III
-
V
)
.

Glandular
proliferation
(
pseudostratification
,
glandular
mitoses
)
in
mifepristone
-
treated
monkeys
was
not
significantly
different
from
that
in
vehicle
(
oestradiol
)
-
treated
monkeys
,
but
was
inhibited
by
progesterone
-
only
treatment
.

Cells
containing
vacuoles
were
scarce
in
the
mifepristone
-
exposed
endometrium
,
but
detected
frequently
in
progesterone
-
exposed
endometria
,
indicating
the
strong
antisecretory
effect
of
mifepristone
on
glands
.

We
conclude
that
oestrogen
-
dependent
oedema
in
the
stroma
is
antagonized
by
mifepristone
.

The
reversal
of
this
effect
by
progesterone
suggests
a
PR
-
mediated
mechanism
.

In
glands
,
mifepristone
is
antiprogestogenic
,
but
not
antioestrogenic
.

Thus
,
stromal
cells
may
be
the
target
of
antiprogestin
-
induced
inhibition
of
oedema
and
endometrial
growth
.

An

The
apparent
molecular
mass
of
the

of
factor
IXaR94S
was
approximately
6
kD
higher
than
that
of
plasma
or
wild

,
which
was
not

by

This
result
indicated
the
presence
of
additional
O

linked
carbohydrate
in
the
mutant
light
chain
,
probably
at
new
Ser

.

The
initial
rate
of
activation
of
factor
X
by
factor
IXaR94S
in
the
presence
of
polylysine
was
7

of
the
initial
rate
of

the
kc

for
activation
of

for
activation
of

.

The
reduced
efficiency
of
activation
of
factor
X
by
factor
IXaR94S
in
the
tenase

was
due
to
a

decrease
in

In
conclusion
,
the
R94S
mutation
had
introduced
an
O

,
which
markedly
impaired
both
activation
by
factor

and
turnover
of

Expression
of
multiple
alpha1

on
vascular

:
correlation
with
the
regulation
of
contraction
.

Previous
work
has
shown
that
the
genes
encoding
each
alpha1
-
adrenoceptor
subtype
are
coexpressed
throughout
the
peripheral
vascular
system
.

We
have
evaluated
subtype

selective
antibodies
as
tools
to
determine
the
extent
of
protein
expression
in
arteries
.

The
alpha1A

alpha1B

and
alpha1D

adrenoceptors
were
detected
in
the
medial

of
the
aorta

iliac
,
renal

and

In
Rat1
fibroblasts
expressing
each
subtype
,
immunoreactivity
was
noted
both
on
the
cell
surface
and
in
a
perinuclear
orientation
.

Intense
alpha1B

adrenoceptor
immunostaining
was
similarly
localized
in
cultured
femoral
and
renal

cells
.

Although
the
cellular
localization
appeared
to
be
the
same
,
immunoreactivity
obtained
with
alpha1A
-
and
alpha1D
-
adrenoceptors
was
much
less
intense
than
that
with
the
alpha1B
-
adrenoceptor
.

The
alpha1A

adrenoceptor
selective
agonist
A

61603
was
22

fold
more
potent
in
activating
renal
artery

when
compared
with
the

.

The
expression
of
each
alpha1

adrenoceptor
was
significantly
decreased
by
in

application
of
antisense
oligonucleotides
targeted
against
each

Inhibition
of
the
expression
of
only
one
,
the
alpha1A

renal
and
the
alpha1D

,
reduced

Probing

.

The
crystallographic
structure
of
human
coagulation
factor
VIIa

with
calcium

was
used
to
model
the

of
the

of
factor

(
residues

)
in
the

The
Amber

was
used
in
the

The

was
then
compared
with
the
crystal
structure
of
factor
VIIa
/
tissue
factor
complex
to
estimate
the
restructuring
of
factor
VIIa
due

.

The
solution
structure
of
the
light
chain
of

in
the

is
predicted
to
be
an

Each

respectively
,
we
have
determined
that
the
tight

folate
site
is
separate
from
the
catalytic
site
and
that
it
is
located
on
the
N

of
the

.

This
was
achieved
by
cross

dideazafolate
to
the
dehydrogenase
through
the

The

was
converted
to
the

proving
that
the

Inhibition

necrosis
factor
alpha
-
stimulated
aromatase
activity
by
microtubule
-
stabilizing
agents
,
paclitaxel
and
2
-
methoxyestradiol
.

The
aromatase
enzyme
,
which
converts
androstenedione
to
oestrone
,
regulates
the
availability
of
oestrogen
to
support
the
growth
of
hormone
-
dependent
breast
tumours
.

Cytokines
,
such
as
interleukin
6
(
IL

)
and
tumour
necrosis
factor
alpha
(
TNFalpha
)
or
prostaglandin
E
(
2
)
(
PGE
(
2
)
)
,
can
stimulate
aromatase
activity
.

These
factors
may
originate
from
cells
of
the
immune
system
that
infiltrate
breast
tumours
.

Paclitaxel
,
which
is
used
in
the
treatment
of
breast
cancer
,
stabilizes
microtubules
and
has
previously
been
shown
to
rapidly
down
-
regulate
TNF
-
receptors
on
human
macrophages
.

The
endogenous
oestrogen
metabolite
,
2
-
methoxyestradiol
(
2
-
meOE2
)
,
also
acts
to
stabilize
microtubules
.

In
this
study
,
we
have
examined
the
ability
of
paclitaxel
or
2
-
meOE2
to
antagonise
TNFalpha
-
stimulated
aromatase
activity
in
stromal
fibroblasts
derived
from
normal
or
malignant
breast
tissues
.

Paclitaxel
inhibited
basal
and
TNFalpha
-
stimulated
aromatase
activities
by
88
%
and
91
%
respectively
.

2
-
MeOE2
also
reduced
basal
and
TNFalpha
-
stimulated
aromatase
activities
by
46
%
and
56
%
respectively
.

Both
paclitaxel
and
2
-
meOE2
also
inhibited
stimulation
of
aromatase
activity
by
IL
-
6
plus
its
soluble
receptor
and
PGE
(
2
)
.

The
16alpha
-
hydroxylated
derivative
of
2
-
meoE2
and
2
-
meOE3
,
which
does
not
bind
to
microtubules
,
was
less
effective
at
inhibiting
TNFalpha
-
stimulated
aromatase
activity
.

Increased
2
-
hydroxylation
of
oestrogens
,
and
subsequent
formation
of
their
2
-
methoxy
derivatives
,
may
be
associated
with
a
reduced
risk
of
breast
cancer
.

It
is
possible
that
the
pathway
of
oestrogen
metabolism
may
influence
the
ability
of
stromal
cells
to
respond
to
cytokine
stimulation
.

Insulin
resistance
and
thrombosis
:
a
cardiologist
'
s
view
.

Atherogenesis
in
the
vasculature
is
accelerated
by
changes
in
the
dynamic
equilibrium
between
endogenous
tissue
plasminogen
activator
and
plasminogen
activator
inhibitor
-
1
(
PAI
-
1
)
.

Increased
expression
of
PAI
-
1
,
decreased
expression
of
tissue
plasminogen
activator
,
or
both
can
lead
to
decreased
fibrinolytic
activity
and
predispose
to
thrombosis
.

Increased
concentrations
of
insulin
(
and
proinsulin
)
in
the
plasma
increase
plasma
PAI
-
1
,
although
the
mechanisms
of
this
effect
are
not
known
.

In
addition
,
it
has
been
observed
that
basal
fibrinolytic
activity
is
decreased
in
patients
with
type
2
diabetes
;
this
may
accelerate
atherosclerosis
by
exposing
vascular
luminal
wall
surfaces
to
persistent
and
recurrent
thrombi
.

Abnormalities
in
the
vessel
wall
appear
to
contribute
to
the
increased
risk
.

There
is
also
evidence
that
PAI
-
1
content
is
increased
in
atherosclerotic
lesions
of
patients
with
type
2
diabetes
,
suggesting
that
interventions
to
reduce
insulin
resistance
and
improve
glycemic
control
may
improve
the
fibrinolytic
response
.

Clinical
studies
in
patients
with
polycystic
ovary
syndrome
(
characterized
by
insulin
resistance
,
hyperinsulinemia
,
ovarian
androgen
overproduction
,
and
impaired
fibrinolytic
capacity
)
demonstrated
that
treatment
with
troglitazone
,
an
insulin
-
sensitizing
agent
,
can
markedly
reduce
blood
levels
of
PAI
-
1
.

There
is
also
clinical
evidence
that
these
agents
may
contribute
to
regression
of
intimal
medial
thickness
in
patients
with
type
2
diabetes
,
providing
further
indication
that
antidiabetic
interventions
may
help
inhibit
the
progression
of
early
atherosclerotic
lesions
.

An
estrogen
receptor
basis
for
raloxifene
action
in
bone
.

Although
controversy
remains
regarding
direct
effects
of
estrogen
on
bone
,
in
vivo
data
clearly
show
that
estrogens
suppress
bone
turnover
,
resulting
in
decreased
bone
resorption
and
formation
activity
.

Selective
estrogen
receptor
modulators
(
SERMs
)
,
such
as
raloxifene
,
produce
effects
on
bone
which
are
very
similar
to
those
of
estrogen
.

In
vitro
,
both
raloxifene
and
estrogen
inhibit
mammalian
osteoclast
differentiation
and
bone
resorption
activity
,
but
only
in
the
presence
of
IL
-
6
.

Data
from
a
number
of
ovariectomized
rat
model
manipulations
(
i
.
e
.
hypophysectomy
,
low
calcium
diet
and
drug
combinations
)
demonstrate
a
strong
parallel
between
the
antiosteopenic
effects
of
raloxifene
and
estrogen
.

A
characteristic
action
of
estrogens
on
the
skeleton
is
inhibition
of
longitudinal
bone
growth
,
an
effect
which
is
not
observed
with
other
resorption
inhibitors
,
including
calcitonin
and
bisphosphonates
.

Consistent
with
an
estrogen
-
like
mechanism
on
bone
,
raloxifene
inhibits
longitudinal
bone
growth
in
growing
rats
.

In
addition
to
the
overall
similarity
of
the
bone
activity
profile
in
animals
,
estrogen
and
raloxifene
also
produce
similar
effects
on
various
signaling
pathways
relative
to
the
antiosteopenic
effect
of
these
two
agents
.

For
example
,
IL
-
6
,
a
cytokine
involved
in
high
turnover
bone
resorption
following
estrogen
deficiency
in
rats
,
is
suppressed
by
both
raloxifene
and
estrogen
.

Raloxifene
and
estrogen
also
produce
a
similar
activation
of
TGF
-
beta3
(
a
cytokine
associated
with
inhibition
of
osteoclast
differentiation
and
activity
)
in
ovariectomized
rats
.

Like
17beta
-
estradiol
,
raloxifene
binds
with
high
affinity
to
both
estrogen
receptor
-
alpha
(
ER
alpha
)
and
estrogen
receptor
-
beta
(
ER
beta
)
.

Crystal
structure
analyses
have
shown
that
17beta
-
estradiol
and
raloxifene
bind
to
ER
alpha
with
small
,
but
important
,
differences
in
three
dimensional
structure
.

These
subtle
differences
in
the
conformation
of
the
ligand
:
receptor
complex
are
likely
the
basis
for
the
key
pharmacological
differences
between
estrogens
and
the
various
SERMs
(
i
.
e
.
raloxifene
vs
tamoxifen
)
.

Raloxifene
also
produces
estrogen
-
like
effects
on
serum
cholesterol
metabolism
and
the
vasculature
.

Thus
,
while
raloxifene
exhibits
a
complete
estrogen
antagonist
in
mammary
tissue
and
the
uterus
,
it
produces
beneficial
effects
on
the
cardiovascular
system
and
prevents
bone
loss
via
an
estrogen
receptor
mediated
mechanism
.

Discovery
of
novel
peptidic
dopamine
transporter
ligands
by
screening
a
positional
scanning
combinatorial
hexapeptide
library
.

The
acute
reinforcing
effects
of
cocaine
are
thought
by
some
to
result
from
cocaine
binding
to
the
dopamine
(
DA
)
transporter
,
which
inhibits
DA
uptake
and
increases
synaptic
DA
levels
in
the
mesolimbic
system
.

Other
data
suggest
that
neurotransmitters
other
than
DA
contribute
to
cocaine
reinforcement
and
addiction
.

These
considerations
illustrate
the
need
to
have
additional
research
tools
with
which
to
test
the
"
DA
hypothesis
.
"
One
strategy
is
to
identify
drugs
which
bind
to
the
DA
transporter
(
DAT
ligands
)
but
which
do
not
inhibit
DA
uptake
as
effectively
as
cocaine
.

The
purpose
of
the
present
study
was
to
identify
members
of
a
novel
structural
class
of
DAT
ligands
and
to
characterize
their
interactions
at
the
DA
transporter
.

A
positional
scanning
hexapeptide
D

amino

library
was
screened
for
inhibition
of
[
(
125
)
I
]
RTI
-
55
binding
to
rat
caudate
DA
transporters
.

Based
on
the
results
,
12
peptides
were
synthesized
.

All
12
peptides
inhibited
[
(
125
)
I
]
RTI
-
55
binding
to
DA
transporters
with
IC
(
50
)
values
,
which
ranged
from
1
.
8
microM
to
12
microM
.

The
two
most
potent
peptides
(
TPI
-
669
-
1
and
TPI
-
669
-
4
)
were
prepared
in
larger
quantities
and
were
characterized
further
for
activity
at
the
DAT
and
5
-
HT
transporter
.

Both
peptides
inhibited
DA
and
5
-
HT
uptake
and
transporter
binding
with
IC
(
50
)
/
K
(
i
)
values
in
the
low
micromolar
range
.

In
vivo
microdialysis
studies
demonstrated
that
both
peptides
increase
extracellular
DA
and
5
-
HT
in
the
nucleus
accumbens
of
rats
.

These
data
demonstrate
that
peptides
can
function
as
inhibitors
of
biogenic
amine
transport
.

Future
work
will
focus
on
developing
more
potent
and
selective
peptides

.

Comparison
of
the
initial
and
overall
reactivation
rate
constants
with
five
oximes
indicated
that
acceleration
by
edrophonium
may
be
due
to
the
prevention
of
re
-
inhibition
of
the
reactivated
enzyme
by
the
phosphorylated
oxime
(
POX
)
produced
during
the

.

With

and
TMB4
,
about
2

increase
in
the

was
observed
in
the
presence
of

,
but
little

was
observed
with

The

of
the

however
,
very

was
found
between

In

edrophonium
had
no

The

of
spinal
prostanoids
in
the
tactile
allodynia
and
thermal
hyperalgesia
associated
with
an
experimental
model
of
neuropathic
pain
was
investigated
.

Neuropathic
pain
was
induced
by
tight
ligation
of
the
L5
and

spinal
nerves
.

Tactile
allodynia
was
assessed
7
days
after
the
surgery
by
measuring
hindpaw

threshold
to
probing
with
von

Thermal

were
determined
by

and
by
applying
radiant
heat
to
the
plantar

of
the

Minimal

was
produced
by

administration
of
ketorolac

Piroxicam

morphine
and

(
90

were
without
significant
antiallodynic

,
but
moderate

effects
were
produced
by
i

th

Further
,
the

Finally

However
,
there
was
no
synergy
between
morphine
and
ketorolac
against
thermal
nociception
in
either
of
the
tests
.

These
findings
suggest
that
spinal
prostanoids
produced
via
both
COX1
and
COX2
pathways
may
play
a
role
in
neuropathic

states
and
suggest
the

Desipramine
treatment
decreases
3H
-
nisoxetine
binding
and
norepinephrine
transporter
mRNA
in
SK

cells
.

The
antidepressant
desipramine
has
been
shown
to
decrease
synaptic
membrane
concentrations
of
the
norepinephrine
re
-
uptake
transporter
(
NET
)
in
vivo
and
in

,
on
both
an
acute
and
a
chronic
basis
.

The
possible
contribution
of
decreased
NET
synthesis
to
the
chronic
downregulation
of
the
NETs
has
not
been
definitively
established
.

In
this
study
,
we
treated
SK

N
-
SHSY5Y
cells
with
100
nM
desipramine
for
24
or
72
h
,
and
measured
3H
-
nisoxetine
binding
(
as
an
estimate
of
NETs
)
and
NET
mRNA
by
quantitative
reverse
transcription
polymerase
chain
reaction
.

Similar
to
what
has
been
reported
previously
,
membrane
3H
-
nisoxetine
binding
was
significantly
decreased
at
both
24
and
72
h
(
approximately
50
%
at
both
time
points
)
.

However
,
a
significant
decrease
(
64

/
-
8
%
of
paired
control
)
of
NET
mRNA
was
observed
only
at
the
72
-
h
time
point
.

We
conclude
that
decreased
NET
synthesis
may
contribute
to
the
chronic
,
but
not
acute
,
effect
of
desipramine
to
downregulate
the
NET

respectively
.

ZD1694
was
moderately
active
against
both

.

Antitumor

ZD1694
at

No

;
a

The
data
indicate
that
ZD1694
was
slightly
more
effective
against
FaDu
than
against
A253
.

Of
interest
and
potential
clinical
importance
was
the
observation
that
ZD1694
was
still
active
at
doses
lower
than
the
MTD

High

in
mouse
relative
to
human
(
approximately
1

microM
and

may
complicate
the
study
of
antitumor

and
toxicity
of
TS
inhibitors
with
human
tumor
xenografts
grown
in
the
mouse
.

To
test
this
hypothesis
,
we
preadministered
methoxypolyethyleneglycol
-
conjugated
thymidine
phosphorylase
(
MPEG
-
TPase
;
2500
units
/
kg

)
to
reduce

,
then
treated
with

using
the
daily
x
5
or
i
.
v
.
x
1
schedules
in
the
A253
tumor
model
.

MPEG

TPase
significantly
increased
the
toxicity
of
ZD1694
;
the
MTD
of
ZD1694
plus
MPEG

was
reduced
3

fold
compared
with
ZD1694
alone
for

,
respectively
.

However
,
preadministration
of
MPEG
-
TPase
did
not
potentiate
the
antitumor
activity
of
ZD1694
with
either
schedule
.

The
data
indicate
that
the
study
of
TS
inhibitors
in
rodent
models
may
not
be
suitable
for
predicting
a
safe
dose
for
clinical
study
.

However
,
rodent
models
,
particularly
human
tumor
xenografts
,
are
still
useful
models
for
evaluation
of
antitumor

and

Crystal
structure
of
human
quinone
reductase
type
2
,
a
metalloflavoprotein
.

In
mammals
,
two
separate
but
homologous
cytosolic
quinone
reductases
have
been
identified
:
NAD
(
P
)
H
:
quinone
oxidoreductase
type
1
(
QR1
)
(
EC

.
6

2
)
and
quinone
reductase
type
2
(
QR2
)
.

Although
QR1
and
QR2
are
nearly
50
%
identical
in
protein
sequence
,
they
display
markedly
different
catalytic
properties
and
substrate
specificities
.

We
report
here
two
crystal
structures
of
QR2
:
in
its
native
form
and
bound
to
menadione
(
vitamin
K
(

)
)
,
a
physiological
substrate
.

Phases
were
obtained
by
molecular
replacement
,
using
our
previously
determined
rat
QR1
structure
as
the
search
model
.

QR2
shares
the
overall
fold
of
the
major
catalytic
domain
of
QR1
,
but
lacks
the
smaller
C
-
terminal
domain
.

The
FAD
binding
sites
of
QR1
and
QR2
are
very
similar
,
but
their
hydride
donor
binding
sites
are
considerably
different
.

Unexpectedly
,
we
found
that
QR2
contains
a
specific
metal
binding
site
,
which
is
not
present
in
QR1
.

Two
histidine
nitrogens
,
one
cysteine
thiol
,
and
a
main
chain
carbonyl
group
are
involved
in
metal
coordination
.

The
metal
binding
site
is
solvent
-
accessible
,
and
is
separated
from
the
FAD
cofactor
by
a
distance
of
about
13
A
.

Direct

Ephedrine

that
exhibit
direct

BACKGROUND
:
Abdominal

have
been
linked
to
increased
levels
of
endogenous
metalloproteinases
(
MMPs
)
within
the
aorta
,
particularly
MMP
-
2
and
MMP
-
9
.

This
provides
a
potential
therapeutic
target
for
pharmacological
agents
aimed
at
reducing
the
growth
rate
of
small
aneurysms
.

In
this
study
,
the
ability
of
marimastat
(
an
MMP
inhibitor
)
to
reduce
matrix
degradation
was
assessed
in
a
previously
described
model
of
aneurysm
disease
.

METHODS
:
Porcine
aortic
segments
(
n
=
12
)
were
preincubated
in
exogenous
pancreatic
elastase
for
24
h
before
culture
in
standard
conditions
for
13
days
with
marimastat

)
,

(
-

)
and
10
(
-

)
mol
/
l
.

Control
segments
were
cultured
both
without
marimastat
and
without
elastase
.

At
the
termination
of
culture
,
MMPs
were
extracted
from
the
tissue
and
quantified
by
substrate
gel
enzymography
.

The
volume
fractions
of
elastin
and
collagen
were
determined
by
stereological
analysis
of
sections
stained
with
Miller
'
s
elastin
and
van
Gieson
'
s
stain
.

RESULTS
:
Stereological
analysis
demonstrated
preservation
of
elastin
in
aorta
treated
with
marimastat
at
10
(
-
6
)
and
10
(
-

)
mol
/

;
this
was
significant
at
the
latter
concentration
(
P

)
.

This
was
accompanied
by
a
significant
reduction
in
active
MMP

activity
in
the
samples
treated
with
marimastat

CONCLUSION
:
Marimastat
significantly
inhibited
elastin

[
The
relation
between
metabolism
of
biopterin
and
dystonia
-
parkinsonism
]
.

Tetrahydrobiopterin
(
BH4
)
is
an
essential
cofactor
for
tyrosine
hydroxylase
.

BH4
can
be
synthesized
from
GTP
through
three
enzymatic
reactions
.

The
rate
-
limiting
step
of
the
BH4
synthesis
is
catalyzed
by
GTP
cyclohydrolase
I
(
GCH
)
.

Recently
,
we
found
that
GCH
is
a
causative
gene
for
hereditary
progressive
dystonia
/
dopa
-
responsive
dystonia
(
HPD
/
DRD
)
.

However
,
several
problems
still
remain
to
be
solved
.

The
first
concern
is
the
presence
of
asymptomatic
carriers
in
the
disease
.

The
difference
between
symptomatic
and
asymptomatic
carriers
is
unknown
.

Second
,
we
cannot
find
any
mutation
in
the
coding
region
of
the
GCH
gene
in
about
40
%
of
the
patients
.

What
kind
of
mutation
would
be
present
in
these
patients
.

The
last
concern
is
the
molecular
mechanism
how
the
enzymatic
activity
is
decreased
to
less
than
20
%
of
normal
values
.

Further
studies
are
required
to
solve
the
questions
.

Use
of
a

that
induce

Here

we
report
the
characterization
of
a

and

MAb
PgammaA53

25
was
raised
against
a
region
in
the
N
-
terminal
domain
of
human
PPARgamma
shared
by
splice
variants
PPARgamma1
and
PPARgamma2
.

It
recognizes
immunizing
antigen
in
enzyme

(
ELISA
)
,
and
does
not
cross
-
react
with
the
N
-
terminal
domains
of
PPARalpha
or
PPARdelta
.

In
Western
blotting
,
PgammaA53
.
25
reacts
with
the
immunizing
antigen
as
well
as
distinct
protein
bands
corresponding
to
the
molecular

The
fluorescence
intensity
of
the
treated
cells
is
TZD
dose
-
dependent
,
and
correlates
with
lipid
accumulation
consistent
with
adipogenesis
.

Based
on
these
results
,
we
propose
that
MAb
PgammaA53
.
25
will
be
a
useful
tool
for
elucidating
the
role
of
PPARgamma
in
fatty

Increased
cyclooxygenase
-
2
expression
in
human
pancreatic
carcinomas
and
cell
lines
:
growth
inhibition
by
nonsteroidal
anti
-
inflammatory
drugs
.

Cyclooxygenase
(
COX
)
-
2
mRNA
and
protein
expression
were
found
to
be
frequently
elevated
in
human
pancreatic
adenocarcinomas
and
cell
lines
derived
from
such
tumors
.

Immunohistochemistry
demonstrated
cytoplasmic
COX
-
2
expression
in
14
of
21
(
67
%
)
pancreatic
carcinomas
.

The
level
of
COX
-
2
mRNA
was
found
to
be
elevated
in
carcinomas
,
relative
to
histologically
normal
pancreas
from
a
healthy
individual
,
as
assessed
by
reverse
transcription
-
PCR
.

COX
-
2
protein
expression
was
detected
by
the
Western
blot
assay
in
three
of
five
pancreatic
carcinoma
cell
lines
(
BxPC
-
3
,
Capan
-
1
,
and
MDAPanc
-
3
)
,
whereas
COX
-
1
protein
was
detected
in
two
of
the
five
cell
lines
(
BxPC
-
3
and
Capan
-
1
)
.

Increased
levels
of
COX
-
2
mRNA
were
found
in
four
of
five
cell
lines
,
and
only
in
PANC
-
1
cells
was
the
low
level
of
transcript
comparable
to
that
in
the
normal
pancreas
.

The
level
of
COX
-
2
mRNA
was
positively
correlated
with
the
differentiation
status
of
the
tumor
of
origin
for
each
cell
line
,
COX
-
2
protein
expression
was
up
-
regulated
by
epidermal
growth
factor
when
the
cells
were
grown
in
absence
of
serum
.

Finally
,
two
nonsteroidal
anti
-
inflammatory
drugs
,
sulindac
sulfide
and
NS398
,
produced
a
dose
-
dependent
inhibition
of
cell
proliferation
in
all
pancreatic
cell
lines
tested
.

No
correlation
was
found
between
the
level
of
COX
-
2
or
COX
-
1
expression
and
the
extent
of
growth
inhibition
.

Treatment
of
BxPC
-
3
cells
with
sulindac
sulfide
and
NS398
resulted
in
an
induction
of
COX
-
2
expression
.

Our
findings
indicate
that
COX
-
2
up
-
regulation
is
a
frequent
event
in
pancreatic
cancers
and
suggest
that
nonsteroidal
anti
-
inflammatory
drugs
may
be
useful
in
the
chemoprevention
and
therapy
of
pancreatic
carcinoma
.

Inhibition
of
ATM
and
ATR
kinase
activities
by
the
radiosensitizing
agent
,
caffeine
.

Caffeine
exposure
sensitizes
tumor
cells
to
ionizing
radiation
and
other
genotoxic
agents
.

The
radiosensitizing
effects
of
caffeine
are
associated
with
the
disruption
of
multiple
DNA
damage
-
responsive
cell
cycle
checkpoints
.

The
similarity
of
these
checkpoint
defects
to
those
seen
in
ataxia
-
telangiectasia
(
A
-
T
)
suggested
that
caffeine
might
inhibit
one
or
more
components
in
an
A
-
T
mutated
(
ATM
)
-
dependent
checkpoint
pathway
in
DNA
-
damaged
cells
.

We
now
show
that
caffeine
inhibits
the
catalytic
activity
of
both
ATM
and
the
related
kinase
,
ATM
and
Rad3
-
related
(
ATR
)
,
at
drug
concentrations
similar
to
those
that
induce
radiosensitization
.

Moreover
,
like
ATM
-
deficient
cells
,
caffeine
-
treated
A549
lung
carcinoma
cells
irradiated
in
G2
fail
to
arrest
progression
into
mitosis
,
and
S
-
phase
-
irradiated
cells
exhibit
radioresistant
DNA
synthesis
.

Similar
concentrations
of
caffeine
also
inhibit
gamma
-
and
UV
radiation
-
induced
phosphorylation
of
p53
on
Ser15
,
a
modification
that
may
be
directly
mediated
by
the
ATM
and
ATR
kinases
.

DNA
-
dependent
protein
kinase
,
another
ATM
-
related
protein
involved
in
DNA
damage
repair
,
was
resistant
to
the
inhibitory
effects
of
caffeine
.

Likewise
,
the
catalytic
activity
of
the
G2
checkpoint
kinase
,
hChk1
,
was
only
marginally
suppressed
by
caffeine
but
was
inhibited
potently
by
the
structurally
distinct
radiosensitizer
,
UCN
-
01
.

These
data
suggest
that
the
radiosensitizing
effects
of
caffeine
are
related
to
inhibition
of
the
protein
kinase
activities
of
ATM
and
ATR
and
that
both
proteins
are
relevant
targets
for
the
development
of
novel
anticancer
agents
.

Cell
culture
conditions
determine
apolipoprotein
CIII
secretion
and
regulation
by
fibrates
in
human
hepatoma
HepG2
cells
.

Fibrates
are
widely
used
drugs
which
lower
triglycerides
and
increase
HDL
concentrations
in
serum
.

Recent
findings
from
our
laboratory
have
shown
that
fibrates
repress
apolipoprotein
(
apo
)
CIII
gene
expression
,
an
effect
that
explains
partially
the
triglyceride
-
lowering
activity
of
these
drugs
.

The
goal
of
the
present
study
was
to
compare
the
effect
of
various
fibrates
on
apo
CIII
gene
expression
in
the
human
hepatoblastoma
cell
line
HepG2
.

First
,
we
demonstrate
that
the
level
of
apo
CIII
secretion
by
HepG2
cells
is
controlled
by
serum
factors
whereas
apo
CIII
mRNA
levels
are
not
and
even
increase
under
conditions
when
apo
CIII
secretion
dramatically
decreases
.

Twelve
different
fetal
calf
serum
batches
were
tested
during
this
study
and
apo
CIII
secretion
in
cell
medium
could
only
be
detected
with
three
of
them
.

The
effect
of
serum
on
apolipoprotein
secretion
was
more
pronounced
for
apo
CIII
whereas
other
apolipoproteins
(
apo
E
,
apo
B
,
apo
AII
and
apo
AI
)
were
affected
to
a
lesser
extent
.

Under
serum
conditions
allowing
apo
CIII
secretion
,
treatment
with
the
peroxisome
-
proliferator
activated
receptor
(
PPAR
)
alpha
activators
fenofibrate
,
gemfibrozil
and
Wy
-
14643
result
in
a
marked
lowering
of
apo
CIII
secretion
and
gene
expression
,
this
effect
being
most
pronounced
with
Wy
-
14643
.

Comparison
of
the
activity
of
a
PPARgamma
-
specific
ligand
,
the
antidiabetic
thiazolidinedione
,
BRL
-

and
a
PPARalpha
ligand
Wy
-
14643
showed
a
marked
decrease
of
apo
CIII
secretion
and
gene
expression
after
activation
of
PPARalpha
but
not
PPARgamma
.

In
conclusion
,
fibrates
down
-
regulate
apo
CIII
gene
expression
in
human
HepG2
cells
,
most
likely
via
PPARalpha
but
not
via
PPARgamma
.

However
,
these
effects
are
only
observed
in
HepG2
cells
cultured
under
appropriate
conditions
.

Variations

in
the

It
has
been
suggested
that
some
contraceptive
derivatives
of

nor
-
testosterone
possess
estrogenic
activity
that
may
facilitate
the
development
of
breast
cancer
.

The
aim
of
this
work
was
to
investigate
the
estrogenic
properties
of
norethisterone
(
NET
)
and
its
A
-
ring
-
reduced
derivatives
by
determining

(

)
and
c
-
fos
mRNA
content
of
two
estrogen
-
regulated
genes
in
the
uterus
of
ovariectomized
rats
.

mRNA
content
was
evaluated
by
Northern
blot
1
-
6
h
after
17
beta
-
estradiol
administration
.

The
highest
PR
and
c
-
fos
mRNA
content
was
observed
3
h
and
2
h
after
17
beta
-
estradiol
administration
,
respectively
.

NET
did
not
modify
either
PR
or
c
-
fos
mRNA
content
.

In
contrast
,
5
alpha
-
and
3
beta
,
5
alpha
-
NET
significantly
increased
mRNA
content
of
both
genes
.

The
increase
in
c
-
fos
mRNA
content
induced
by
these
reduced
compounds
was
lower
than
that
found
with
estradiol
treatment
.

The
overall
results
indicate
that
NET
administration
can
indirectly
induce
estrogenic
effects
through
the
action
of
its
5
alpha
-
dihydro
and
3
beta

5
alpha
-
tetrahydro
derivatives
.

cell
clones
to
Tomudex
.

Mechanisms
of
resistance
to
Tomudex
include
increased
thymidylate
synthase
activity
,
as
well
as
reduced
intracellular
drug
uptake
and
polyglutamation
.

However
,
little
is
known
about
other
mechanisms
of
resistance
,
such
as
a
possible
protection
against
Tomudex
-
induced
apoptosis
mediated
by
bcl
-

.

We
transfected
the
MDA
-
MB
-
435
human
breast
cancer
cell
line
,
which
is
characterized
by
a
mutated
p53
gene
,
with
cDNA
of
the
bcl
-
2
gene
and
generated
two
clones
(
MDA
-
bcl4
and
MDA
-
bcl7
)
characterized
by
bcl
-
2
expression
twofold
and
fourfold
that
observed
in
the
control
cell
clone
(
MDAneo
)
.

A
concomitant
overexpression
of
p21wafl
was
also
detected
in
the
MDA
-
bcl7
clone
.

The
MDA
-
bcl4
clone
was
three
times
more
resistant
to
a
24
-
h
Tomudex
exposure
than
the
MDAneo
clone
,
whereas
the
MDA
-
bcl7
clone
was
as
sensitive
to
Tomudex
as
the
control
cell
clone
.

A
lower
sensitivity
of
the
MDA
-
bcl4
clone
than
MDAneo
and
MDA
-
bcl7
clones
to
5
-
fluorouracil
and
gemcitabine
was
also
observed
.

No
significant
difference
was
noted
in
the
susceptibility
of
clones
to
fludarabine
and
methothrexate
.

Basal
levels
of
thymidylate
synthase
activity
were
superimposable
in
the
three
clones
.

Tomudex
induced
a
marked
accumulation
of
cells
in
the
S
phase
in
all
the
clones
.

However
,
an
apoptotic
hypodiploid
DNA
peak
and
the
characteristic
nuclear
morphology
of
apoptosis
were
observed
only
in
the
MDA
-
bcl7
clone
after
exposure
to
Tomudex
.

No
difference
in
the
treatment
-
induced
modulation
of
proteins
involved
in
cell
cycle
progression
(
cyclin
A
,
cdk2
,
pRB
,
E2F
-

)
and
apoptosis
(
bcl
-
2
,
bax
)
was
observed
in
the
three
clones
.

The
only
exception
was
that
the
expression
of
p21wafl
in
the
MDA
-
bcl4
clone
was
inducible
at
a
Tomudex
concentration
much
higher
than
that
required
to
induce
the
protein
in
the
other
clones
.

Overall
,
the
results
indicate
that
bcl
-
2
and
p21wafl
proteins
concur
in
determining
the
cellular
profile
of
sensitivity
/
resistance
to
Tomudex
.

Suppression

)
-
androstenediol
-
induced
androgen
receptor
transactivation
by
selective
steroids
in

Our
earlier
report
suggested
that
androst

7beta

diol
(
Delta
(

-
androstenediol

is
a
natural
hormone
with
androgenic
activity
and
that
two
potent
antiandrogens
,
hydroxyflutamide
(
Eulexin
)
and
bicalutamide
(
Casodex
)
,
fail
to
block
completely
the
Adiol

in

.

Here
,
we
report
the
development
of
a

and
could
also
block
the

.

Interestingly
,
these
compounds
,
in
combination
with
hydroxyflutamide
,
further
suppressed
the
Adiol

AR
transactivation
.

Reporter
assays
further
showed
that
these
four
anti
-
Adiol
steroids
have
relatively
lower
glucocorticoid
,
progesterone
,
and
estrogenic
activity
.

Together
,
these
data
suggest
some
selective
steroids
might
have
anti

Adiol
activity
,
which
may
have
potential
clinical
application
in
the
battle
against
the

EPR
studies
on
the
photo
-
induced
intermediates
of
ferric
NO
complexes
of
rat
neuronal
nitric
oxide
synthase
trapped
at
low
temperature
.

Rat
neuronal
nitric
oxide
synthase
(
nNOS
)
was
expressed
in
Escherichia
coli
and
purified
.

Although
the
nitric
oxide
(
NO
)
complex
of
the
ferric
heme
was
EPR
-
silent
,
photo
-
illumination
at
5
K
to
the
NO
complex
of
the
ferric
nNOS
in
the
substrate
-
free
form
produced
a
new
high
spin
EPR
signal
similar
to
that
of
the
ferric
heme
of
N
(
omega
)
-
nitro
-
L
-
arginine
-
bound
nNOS
,
suggesting
that
the
photo
-
dissociated
NO
might
move
away
from
the
heme
.

Low
photo
-
dissociability
of
NO
in
this
complex
indicated
less
restricted
movement
of
the
dissociated
NO
in
the
distal
region
of
the
heme
,
which
might
result
in
the
rapid
rebinding
of
the
NO
to
the
ferric
heme
at
5
K
.

In
the
presence
of
substrate
L
-
arginine
,
derivatives
,
or
product
L
-
citrulline
,
the
photo
-
products
from
the
ferric
NO
complexes
exhibited
large
novel
EPR
signals
with
a
spin
-
coupled
interaction
between
the
ferric
heme
(
S
=
5
/
2
)
and
the
photolyzed
NO
(
S
=
1
/
2
)
,
suggesting
a
stereochemically
restricted
interaction
between
the
photo

dissociated
NO
and
the
guanidino
-
or
the
ureido
-
group
of
the
substrate
analogues
at
the
distal
heme
region
of
nNOS
.

The
photo
-
product
from
the
NO
complex
produced
from
citrulline
-
bound
nNOS
might
be
the
same
intermediate
species
as
that
formed
in
the
last

the
catalytic

Raloxifene
:
a
selective
estrogen
receptor
modulator
.

Raloxifene
is
a
selective
estrogen
receptor
modulator
that
produces
both
estrogen
-
agonistic
effects
on
bone
and
lipid
metabolism
and
estrogen
-
antagonistic
effects
on
uterine
endometrium
and
breast
tissue
.

Because
of
its
tissue
selectivity
,
raloxifene
may
have
fewer
side
effects
than
are
typically
observed
with
estrogen
therapy
.

The
most
common
adverse
effects
of
raloxifene
are
hot
flushes
and
leg
cramps
.

The
drug
is
also
associated
with
an
increased
risk
of
thromboembolic
events
.

The
beneficial
estrogenic
activities
of
raloxifene
include
a
lowering
of
total
and
low
-
density
lipoprotein
cholesterol
levels
and
an
augmentation
of
bone
mineral
density
.

Raloxifene
has
been
labeled
by

prevention
of
osteoporosis
.

However
,
its
effects
on
fracture
risk
and
its
ability
to
protect
against
cardiovascular
disease
have
yet
to
be
determined
.

Studies
are
also
being
conducted
to
determine
its
impact

Inhibition
of

(
HERG
)
potassium

by
cisapride
:
affinity
for

Cisapride
is
a
prokinetic
agent
which
has
been
associated
with
QT
prolongation
,
torsades
de
pointes
and
cardiac
arrest
.

The
cellular
mechanism
for
these
observations
is
high
affinity
blockade
of
IKr
(
encoded
by
HERG
)
.

2
In
a
chronic
transfection
model
using
CHO
-
K1
cells
,
cisapride
inhibited
HERG
tail
currents
after
a
step
to

with
similar
potency
at

.

Channel

exhibited
time

.

In

,
channel

increased
from

depolarizing
step
to
50
+

-

after
a

step
.

These
findings
suggested
affinity
for
open
and

or
inactivated
channel
states
.

4
Inactivation
was
significantly
accelerated
by
cisapride
in
a
concentration

dependent
manner
and
there
was
a
small
(
-
7
mV
)
shift
in
the
voltage
dependence
of
steady
state
inactivation
.

5
Channel
blockade
by
cisapride
was
modulated
by
[

,
with
a
26

reduction
in
the
potency
of
channel
blockade
when
[
K

o
was
increased
from

to
10
mM
.

6
In
conclusion
,
HERG
channel
inhibition
by
cisapride
exhibits
features
consistent
with
open
and
inactivated
state
binding
and
is
sensitive
to
external
potassium
concentration
.

These
features
may
have
significant
clinical
implications
with

to
the
mechanism
and

Modification
of
dopamine
D2
receptor
activity
by
pergolide
in
Parkinson
'
s
disease
:
an
in
vivo
study
by
PET
.

It
is
well
known
that
chronic
administration
of
pergolide
and
other
dopamine
agonists
may
induce
a
downregulation
of
dopamine
D2
receptors
in
the
rat
model
of
Parkinson
'
s
disease
(
PD
)
.

To
our
knowledge
,
this
effect
has
not
been
demonstrated
in
vivo
in
patients
with
PD
.

At
present
,
the
status
of
striatal
dopamine
D2
receptors
can
be
studied
with
use
of
positron
emission
tomographic
(
PET
)
technology
.

Five
patients
with
PD
chronically
treated
with
levodopa
were
studied
with
use
of
PET
and
[
11C
]
-
raclopride
before
and
after
6
months
of
pergolide
treatment
(
dose
range
=
4
.
5
-
7
.
5
mg
/
d
)
.

We
found
a
slight
reduction
in
the
specific
striatal
[
11C
]
-
raclopride
uptake
index
(
mean
reduction
14
%
in
putamen
and
9
%
in
caudate
)
after
pergolide
treatment
.

This
reduction
appears
to
be
related
to
downregulation
of
the
receptor
,
although
competitive
binding
of
pergolide
at
the
D2
receptor
cannot
be
excluded
.

Comparison
of
the
novel
antipsychotic
ziprasidone
with
clozapine
and
olanzapine
:
inhibition
of
dorsal
raphe
cell
firing
and
the
role
of
5
-
HT1A
receptor
activation
.

Ziprasidone
is
a
novel
antipsychotic
agent
which
binds
with
high
affinity
to
5
-
HT1A
receptors
(
Ki
=
3
.
4
nM
)
,
in
addition
to
5
-
HT1D
,
5
-
HT2
,
and
D2
sites
.

While
it
is
an
antagonist
at
these
latter
receptors
,
ziprasidone
behaves
as
a
5
-
HT1A
agonist
in
vitro
in
adenylate
cyclase
measurements
.

The
goal
of
the
present
study
was
to
examine
the
5
-
HT1A
properties
of
ziprasidone
in
vivo
using
as
a
marker
of
central
5
-
HT1A
activity
the
inhibition
of
firing
of
serotonin
-
containing
neurons
in
the
dorsal
raphe
nucleus
.

In
anesthetized
rats
,
ziprasidone
dose
-
dependently
slowed
raphe
unit
activity
(
ED50
=
300
micrograms
/
kg
i
.
v
.
)
as
did
the
atypical
antipsychotics
clozapine
(
ED50
=
250
micrograms
/
kg
i
.
v
.
)
and
olanzapine
(
ED50
=
1000
micrograms
/
kg
i
.
v
.
)
.

Pretreatment
with
the
5
-
HT1A
antagonist
WAY
-
100
,
635
(
10
micrograms
/
kg
i
.
v
.
)
prevented
the
ziprasidone
-
induced
inhibition
;
the
same
dose
of
WAY
-
100
,
635
had
little
effect
on
the
inhibition
produced
by
clozapine
and
olanzapine
.

Because
all
three
agents
also
bind
to
alpha
1
receptors
,
antagonists
of
which
inhibit
serotonin
neuronal
firing
,
this
aspect
of
their
pharmacology
was
assessed
with
desipramine
(
DMI
)
,
a
NE
re
-
uptake
blocker
previously
shown
to
reverse
the
effects
of
alpha
1
antagonists
on
raphe
unit
activity
.

DMI
(
5
mg
/
kg
i
.
v
.
)
failed
to
reverse
the
inhibitory
effect
of
ziprasidone
but
produced
nearly
complete
reversal
of
that
of
clozapine
and
olanzapine
.

These
profiles
suggest
a
mechanism
of
action
for
each
agent
,
5
-
HT1A
agonism
for
ziprasidone
and
alpha
1
antagonism
for
clozapine
and
olanzapine
.

The
5
-
HT1A
agonist
activity
reported
here
clearly
distinguishes
ziprasidone
from
currently
available
antipsychotic
agents
and
suggests
that
this
property
may
play
a
significant
role
in
its
pharmacologic
actions
.

CCK
-
mediated
response
in
the
activation
of
5
-
HT
receptor
types
in
the
guinea

pig
ileum
.

The
possible
interaction
between
cholecystokinin
(
CCK
)
and
5
-
hydroxytryptamine
(
5
-
HT
)
was
evaluated
in
vitro
in
the
longitudinal
muscle
-
myenteric
plexus
of
the
guinea
-
pig
ileum
.

Devazepide
and
L
-
365
,
260
were
used
to
block
CCKA
and
CCK
(
B
)
receptors
and
ondansetron
and
tropisetron
to
block
5
-
HT3
and
5
-
HT4
receptors
,
respectively
.

The
CCK
receptor
antagonists
blocked
,
in
a
dose
-
dependent
manner
,
the
response
to
5
-
HT
and
to
the
selective
agonists
at
5
-
HT3
and
5
-
HT4
receptors
,
2
-
methyl
-
5
-
hydroxytryptamine
(
2
-
Me
-
5
-
HT
)
and
5
-
methoxytryptamine
(
5
-
MeOT
)
,
respectively
.

The
blockade
was
almost
complete
on
the
first
phase
of
the
concentration
response
curve
to
5
-
HT
and
for
all
the
concentrations
of
5
-
MeOT
tested
.

In
the
2
-
Me
-
5
-
HT
-
induced
contractile
response
there
was
a
component
with
the
same
sensitivity
to
devazepide
and
to
the
selective
NK1
receptor
antagonist
,
GR
82334
,
and
another
resistant
component
that
was
abolished
by
atropine
.

However
,
the
blockade
of
the
NK1
receptor
did
not
produce
a
significant
increase
in
the
inhibition
obtained
when
atropine
or
devazepide
were
separately
tested
on
the
5
-
MeOT
-
induced
response
.

These
results
suggest
that
CCK
is
involved
in
the
5
-
HT
-
induced
contractile
response
,
particularly
in
the
response
induced
by
5
-
HT4
receptor
stimulation
.

Pharmacological
plasticity
of
cardiac
ATP
-
sensitive
potassium
channels
toward
diazoxide
revealed
by
ADP
.

The
pharmacological
phenotype
of
ATP
-
sensitive
potassium
(
K
(
ATP
)
)
channels
is
defined
by
their
tissue
-
specific
regulatory
subunit
,
the
sulfonylurea
receptor
(
SUR
)
,
which
associates
with
the
pore
-
forming
channel
core
,
Kir6
.
2
.

The
potassium
channel
opener
diazoxide
has
hyperglycemic
and
hypotensive
properties
that
stem
from
its
ability
to
open
K
(
ATP
)
channels
in
pancreas
and
smooth
muscle
.

Diazoxide
is
believed
not
to
have
any
significant
action
on
cardiac
sarcolemmal
K
(
ATP
)
channels
.

Yet
,
diazoxide
can
be
cardioprotective
in
ischemia
and
has
been
found
to
bind
to
the
presumed
cardiac
sarcolemmal
K
(
ATP
)
channel
-
regulatory
subunit
,
SUR2A
.

Here
,
in
excised
patches
,
diazoxide
(
300
microM
)
activated
pancreatic

.
2
currents
and
had
little
effect
on
native
or
recombinant
cardiac
SUR2A
/
Kir6
.
2
currents
.

However
,
in
the
presence
of
cytoplasmic
ADP
(
100
microM
)
,
SUR2A
/
Kir6
.
2
channels
became
as
sensitive
to
diazoxide
as
SUR1
/
Kir6
.
2
channels
.

This
effect
involved
specific
interactions
between
MgADP

SUR

as
it
required

)
,
but
not
ATP
,
and
was
abolished
by
point
mutations
in
the
second
nucleotide
-
binding
domain
of
SUR
,
which
impaired
channel
activation
by
MgADP
.

At
the
whole
-
cell
level
,
in
cardiomyocytes
treated
with
oligomycin
to
block
mitochondrial
function
,
diazoxide
could
also
activate
K
(
ATP
)
currents
only
after
cytosolic
ADP
had
been
raised
by
a
creatine
kinase
inhibitor
.

Thus
,
ADP
serves
as
a
cofactor
to
define
the
responsiveness
of
cardiac
K
(
ATP
)
channels
toward
diazoxide
.

The
present
demonstration
of
a
pharmacological
plasticity
of
K
(
ATP
)
channels
identifies
a
mechanism
for
the
control
of
channel
activity
in
cardiac
cells
depending
on
the
cellular
ADP
levels
,
which
are

A
review
of
the
preclinical
and
clinical
data
of
newer
intranasal
steroids
used
in
the
treatment
of
allergic
rhinitis
.

The
anti
-
inflammatory
activity
of
corticosteroids
has
prompted
the
exploration
of
their
use
in
the
treatment
of
allergic
rhinitis
.

The
development
of
intranasal
steroids
has
resulted
in
several
agents
with
quick
actions
,
localized
effects
,
and
great
efficacy
in
the
treatment
of
seasonal
allergic
rhinitis
and
the
prophylactic
management
of
perennial
rhinitis
.

This
article
presents
a
concise
review
of
the
preclinical
and
clinical
evidence
with
these
new
agents
and
provides
data
-
based
guidance
for
the
selection
of
optimal
agents
.

The
survey
reveals
that
mometasone
furoate
,
a
new
inhaled
steroid
with
topical
activity
,
has
the
greatest
binding
affinity
for
the
glucocorticoid
receptor
,
followed
by
fluticasone
propionate
,
budesonide
,
triamcinolone
acetonide
,
and
dexamethasone
.

Mometasone
furoate
also
has
strong
anti
-
inflammatory
activity
,
with
IL
-
4
and
IL
-
5
inhibition
activities
equivalent
to
those
of
fluticasone
propionate
.

Clinically
,
both
mometasone
furoate
and
fluticasone
propionate
appear
to
be
well
tolerated
,
to
have
quick
onsets
of
action
,
and
to
be
equivalent
in
efficacy
in
the
treatment
of
seasonal
allergic
and
perennial
rhinitis
.

Of
the
intranasal
steroids
currently
available
,
mometasone
furoate
has
been
shown
to
have
the
least
systemic
availability
and
,
consequently
,
is
expected
to
have
the
fewest
systemic
side
effects
.

Some
suppression
of
overnight
cortisol
levels
has
been
reported
with
fluticasone
propionate
(
indicative
of
hypothalamic
-
pituitary
-
adrenal
axis
suppression
)
.

A
novel
mutation
of
delta
-
aminolaevulinate
dehydratase
in
a
healthy
child
with
12
%
erythrocyte
enzyme
activity
.

Cloning
,
expression
and
phenotype
studies
of
the
defective
gene
for
delta
-
aminolaevulinate
dehydratase
(
ALAD
)
in
a
family
with
an
asymptomatic
girl
who
had
ALAD
deficiency
were
carried
out
.

The
proband
was
identified
by
neonatal
ALAD
screening
,
and
had
erythrocyte
ALAD
activity
at
12
%
of
the
normal
control
.

She
was
heterozygous
for
ALAD
deficiency
,
which
was
inherited
from
her
father
.

Nucleotide
sequence
analysis
of
the
cloned
ALAD
cDNA
revealed
C36
to
G
and
T168
to
C
mutations
on
the
same
allele
.

The
former
mutation
resulted
in
F12L
substitution
,
whereas
the
latter
was
a
silent
mutation
.

All
family
members
who
had
decreased
ALAD
activity
had
the
same
mutation
.

Expression
of
the
mutant
ALAD
cDNA
in
Chinese
hamster
ovary
cells
produced
an
ALAD
protein
without
significant
enzyme
activity
.

Additionally
,
the
mutant
ALAD
cDNA
which
encodes
F12L
substitution
produced
an
aberrant
migration
pattern
in
polyacrylamide
gel
electrophoresis
under
denaturing
conditions
.

This
finding
probably
reflects
an
abnormal
folding
of
the
F12L
protein
,
since
the
mutation
occurred
in
the
alpha1
helix
of
the
N
-
terminal
arm
of
the
enzyme
,
which
is
involved
in
the
extensive
quaternary
interactions
among
the
subunits
.

This
is
also
the
first
report
of
ALAD
gene
mutation
in
an
asymptomatic
subject
.

Tamsulosin
:
assessment
of

)
H
-
P
razosin
binding
to
two
alpha
-
1
-
adrenoceptor
subtypes
in
the
canine
aorta
.

This
study
was
performed
to
assess
the
affinity
of
tamsulosin
to
the
alpha
(
1L
)
-
in
addition
to
alpha
(
1B
)
-
adrenoceptor
(
alpha
(
1
)
-
AR
)
subtypes
coexisting
in
the
canine
aorta
using
the
radioligand
binding
assay
.

The
antagonistic
effects
of
this
drug
on
contraction
of
the
rat
aorta
were
also
assessed
,
and
the
results
were
compared
with
those
obtained
with
prazosin
,
amosulalol
,
labetalol
,
ketanserin
,
clonidine
and
propranolol
.

The
pKi
value
of
tamsulosin
to
the
alpha
(
1L
)
-
subtype
was
lower
than
those
of
prazosin
and
HV
-
723
,
but
higher
than
those
of
amosulalol
,
ketanserin
and
labetalol
.

The
pKi
value
of
tamsulosin
for
the
alpha
(
1B
)
-
subtype
in
the
canine
aorta
was
similar
to
that
of
prazosin
.

However
,
this
drug
showed
a
higher
pKi
value
than
amosulalol
,
HV
-
723
,
labetalol
and
ketanserin
.

On
the
other
hand
,
the
order
of
inhibition
potencies
for
contraction
of
the
rat
aorta
by
phenylephrine
was
as
follows
:
prazosin
>
tamsulosin
>
amosulalol
>
HV
-
723
>
labetalol
>
ketanserin
>
clonidine
>
propranolol
.

Thus
,
although
the
affinity
of
tamsulosin
to
the
alpha
(
1B
)
-
AR
subtype
in
the
canine
aorta
was
as
high
as
that
in
the
bovine
prostate
reported
in
our
previous
study
,
the
affinity
(
pKi
7
.
87
)
of
this
drug
to
alpha
(
1L
)
-
AR
in
the
canine
aorta
was
lower
than
that
(
pKi
8
.
99
)
in
the
bovine
prostate
.

These
observations
suggested
that
the
pharmacological
potencies
of
tamsulosin
in
the
aorta
and
prostate
may
be
different
.

In

.

The
rate
and
extent
of
binding
of
methazolamide
to
human
erythrocytes
was
studied
in

.

All
experiments
were
carried
out
at
physiological
temperature
(
37
C
)
and
pH
(

.

Methazolamide
(

buffer
concentrations
were
analyzed
by
HPLC
.

Distributional
equilibrium
between
buffer
and
washed
red
blood
cells
was
achieved
after
1
hr
.

Results
of
equilibrium
studies
were
consistent
with
two
classes
of
binding
sites
for
MTZ
within
the
erythrocyte
:
a
low

(

Based

these
findings
,
kinetic
studies
were
performed
in

to
characterize
the
rate
of

.

The
rate
of

was
mathematically
modeled
using
a
series
of
differential
equations
describing
drug
diffusion
across
the
red

membrane
and
subsequent
complexation
with
intracellular

sites
.

The
model
assumed
that
penetration
of
MTZ
into
the
red

was
passive
but
drug

was
not

Radioimmunotherapy
of

s
lymphoma
with
zevalin
,
a
90Y

monoclonal
antibody
.

Approximately
55
,
400
new
cases
of
non

Hodgkin
'

lymphoma
(
NHL
)
are
diagnosed
each
year
,
with
the
overall
prevalence
of
the
disease
now
estimated
to
be
243
,
000
.

Until
recently
,
treatment
alternatives
for
advanced
disease
included
chemotherapy
with
or
without
external
beam
radiation
.

Based
on
the
results
of
several
clinical
trials
,
the
chimeric
monoclonal
antibody
Rituximab
has
now
been
approved
by
the
United
States
Food
and
Drug
Administration
as
a
treatment
for
patients
with
relapsed
or
refractory
,
low

grade
or

NHL
.

Several
other
monoclonal
antibodies
in
conjugated
and
unconjugated
forms
have
been
evaluated
in
the
treatment
of
NHL
.

Ibritumomab
,
the
murine
counterpart
to
Rituximab
,
radiolabeled
with
90Y
(
Zevalin
)
,
is
presently
being
evaluated
in
clinical
trials
.

The
success
of
radioimmunotherapy
is
dependent
upon
the
appropriate
choice
of
antibody
,
isotope
,
and
chelator
-
linker
.

The
Ibritumomab
antibody
targets
the
CD20
antigen
.

The
antibody
is
covalently
bound
to
the
chelator
-
linker
tiuxetan
(
MX

DTPA
)
,
which
tightly
chelates
the
isotope

.

To

have
been
completed
in

.

The
overall

Reduction
of
oral
ethanol
self

administration
in
rats
by
monoamine
oxidase
inhibitors
.

Evidence
for
a
role
of
dopamine
and
serotonin
in
the
control
of
ethanol
intake
in
animals
suggests
that
monoamine
oxidase
(
MAO
)
inhibitors
,
which
increase
the
synaptic
availability
of
serotonin
and
dopamine
by
blocking
their
metabolism
,
might
have
efficacy
in
the
treatment
of
alcohol
dependence
.

The
aim
of
the
present
study
was
,
therefore
,
to
evaluate
several
MAO
inhibitors
for
their
capacity
to
affect
ethanol
self
-
administration
in
rats
trained
to
self

administer
ethanol
(

,
and
nialamide
(

,
decreased

,
befloxatone
(

)
,
and
the
irreversible
MAO
-
A
inhibitor
,
clorgyline
(
10
-
30
mg

)
,
also
reduced
ethanol
self

administration
.

However
,
befloxatone

induced
effects
leveled
off
at
a
50
%
decrease
.

The
irreversible

inhibitors
,
pargyline
(
30
mg

)
and
l
-
deprenyl
(
3

10
mg

)
also
decreased
responding
maintained
by
ethanol
reinforcement
;
these
results
are
consistent
with
previous
findings
that
both
drugs
decreased
ethanol
intake
in
mice
.

In
conclusion
,
the
present
results
showing
that
several
MAO
inhibitors
decreased
ethanol
self
-
administration
in
rats
are
consistent
with
previous
findings
that
synaptic
levels
of
serotonin
and
dopamine
play
a
critical
role
in
the
control
of
ethanol
self

activated
receptor
gamma
with

(

)
in
human
adipocytes
.

To
better
define
the
mechanism
of
action
of
the
thiazolidinediones
,
we
incubated
freshly
isolated
human
adipocytes
with
rosiglitazone
and
investigated
the
changes
in
mRNA
expression
of
genes
encoding
key
proteins
of
adipose
tissue
functions
.

Rosiglitazone

,
and
PPARgamma1
and

were
not
modified
by
rosiglitazone
treatment
.

Activation
of
RXR
,
the
partner
of
PPARgamma
,
in
the
presence
of
rosiglitazone
,
increased
further
p85alphaPI

3K
and
UCP2
mRNA
levels
and
produced
a
significant
augmentation
of

expression
.

Because
p85alphaPI

3K
is
a
major
component
of
insulin
action
,
the
induction
of
its
expression
might
explain
,
at

,
the

to
that
with

.

Both
rofecoxib

CONCLUSION
:
Specific

rofecoxib
,
administered
once

,
resulted
in
clinically
meaningful
improvements
in

This
study
confirms
that
COX

derived
prostanoids
are
important
clinical
mediators
of
pain
and
other
symptoms
of
knee
OA
and
that
inhibition

to
provide
clinical
benefit

Proteolysis

Hepatocytes

The

Comparison
of
rofecoxib

inhibitors
,
in
postoperative
dental
pain
:
a

controlled
clinical
trial
.

Pain
is
a
common
complaint
,
often
occurring
in
conjunction
with
inflammation
.

Nonsteroidal
anti
-
inflammatory
drugs
(
NSAIDs
)
are
the
most
commonly
used
analgesic
agents
in
ambulatory
patients
.

In
recent
studies
,
the
cyclooxygenase

2
(
COX
-
2
)
inhibitor
rofecoxib
demonstrated
analgesic
effects
similar
to
those
of
NSAIDs
in
the
treatment
of
acute
pain
and
primary
dysmenorrhea
.

The
present

,
double

and
active

was
undertaken
to
compare
the
analgesic
efficacy
of
the
COX

rofecoxib
50

and
celecoxib
200

with
that
of
ibuprofen
400

and
placebo
in
patients
with

.

Two

two
patients
experiencing
pain
after
the
removal
of

were
randomized
according
to
pain

to
receive
a

,
rofecoxib
50

(
n

,
celecoxib

(
n

,
or
ibuprofen

(

.

Using
a
patient
diary
,
patients
recorded
pain
intensity
,
pain
relief
,
and
global
evaluations
throughout
the
24

period
after
dosing
.

The
overall
analgesic
effect
,
onset
of
action
,
peak

,
and
duration
of

were
evaluated
,
with
the
primary

.

The
safety
profile
was
assessed
on
the
basis
of
physical
findings
,
laboratory
results
,
and
spontaneous
reports
of
adverse
experiences
.

The
results
showed
that
compared
with
celecoxib
,
rofecoxib
had
superior
analgesic
effects
on
all
measures
of
analgesic
efficacy
,
including
overall

(

(

.

In
addition
,
rofecoxib
'
s
analgesic
efficacy
was
similar
to
that
of
ibuprofen
(

,
18

,
but
the

was
longer
(

)
;
with
ibuprofen
,
the
time
to

was

,
peak
pain
relief
score
was

and
duration
of
analgesic
effect
was
8

9
hours
.

The
safety
profile
was
similar
across
all
treatment
groups
.

Thus
rofecoxib
provided
analgesic
efficacy
superior
to
that
of
celecoxib
and
comparable
to
that
of
ibuprofen
in
the
treatment
of
patients
with
acute

Natriuretic
response
to

.

Elevation
of
renal
interstitial
hydrostatic
pressure
(
RIHP
)
by
direct
renal
interstitial

expansion
increases
sodium
excretion
.

This
natriuretic
response
is
blunted
by
the
nonspecific
inhibition
of
the
cyclooxygenase

The

tested
the
hypothesis
that
the
natriuretic

to
increased
RIHP

In

The

is

The
association
of

has
been
previously
shown
to
be
important
for
the

.

The
crucial
role
of
Gb
(
3
)
for
the
signal
transduction
of
IFN
-
alpha
-
mediated
antiviral
activity
is
now
reported
.

IFN
-
alpha
-
mediated
antiviral
activity
,
nuclear
translocation
of
activated
Stat1
,
and
increased
expression
of
PKR
were
defective
in
Gb
(
3
)
-
deficient
vero
mutant
cells
,
although
the
surface
expression
of
IFNAR1
was
unaltered
.

The
VT1B
subunit
was
found
to
inhibit
IFN
-
alpha

mediated
antiviral
activity
,
Stat1
nuclear
translocation
and
PKR
upregulation
.

Unlike
VT1
cytotoxicity
,
IFN

alpha
-
induced
Stat1
nuclear
translocation
was
not
inhibited
when
RME
was
prevented
,
suggesting
that
the
accessory
function
of
Gb
(

)
occurs
at
the
plasma
membrane
.

IFN

was
also
studied
in
Gb

,
which
are
resistant
to

,
partially
resistant
to

still
remain
fully
sensitive
to

,
and
two
astrocytoma
cell
lines
expressing
different

.

In
both
systems
,
long
chain
fatty
acid
-
containing
Gb
(
3
)
isoforms
,
which
are
less
effective
to
mediate
VT1
cytotoxicity
,
were
found
to
correlate
with
higher
IFN

alpha

antiviral
activity
.

Inhibition
of
Gb
(
3
)
synthesis
in
toto
prevented
IFN

alpha
antiviral
activity
in
all
cells
.

We
propose
that
the
long
chain
Gb
(
3
)
fatty
isoforms
preferentially
remain
in
the
plasma
membrane
,
and
by
associating
with
IFNAR1
,
mediate
IFN

antiviral
signaling
,
whereas
short

are
preferentially
internalized
to
mediate

Na

this

to
be

In

and
expressed
in
a

under
the

The

up

10

greater
bumetanide

compared
to
the

The

have
acquired
a
typical

indicated
by
:
(

Loss

The

retained
their

Furthermore

;
bumetanide
and
furosemide
inhibited
the
clonogenic
efficiency
in
the
NKCC1

.

These
control
experiments
indicate
that
the
apparent
transformation
phenotype
acquired
by
the
Balb

NKCC1
cells
was
not
merely
associated
with
the
process
of
transfection
and
selecting
for
the
neomycin

,
but
rather
with
the
overexpression
of
the
Na

cotransporter

.

In
order
to
ascertain
that
the
regulated
and
normal

of
the
Na

K
(

,
the

of
bumetanide

was
tested
on

,
induced

growth

and
fetal

.

Bumetanide
inhibited

from
the
G

and
entering
S

.

The
inhibition
was
reversible
,
as
removal
of
bumetanide
completely
released
cell

.

Taken
together
,
these
results
propose
that
the
NKCC1
gene
is
involved
in
the
control
of
normal
cell
proliferation
,
while
its
overexpression
results
in
apparent
cell

,
in
a
manner
similar

Effects
of
chronic
antidepressant
treatments
on
serotonin
transporter
function
,
density
,
and
mRNA
level
.

To
investigate
functional
changes
in
the
brain
serotonin
transporter
(
SERT
)
after
chronic
antidepressant
treatment
,
several
techniques
were
used
to
assess
SERT
activity
,
density
,
or
its
mRNA
content
.

Rats
were
treated
by
osmotic
minipump
for
21
d
with
the
selective
serotonin
reuptake
inhibitors
(
SSRIs
)
paroxetine
or
sertraline
,
the
selective
norepinephrine
reuptake
inhibitor
desipramine
(
DMI
)
,
or
the
monoamine
oxidase
inhibitor
phenelzine
.

High
-
speed
in
vivo
electrochemical
recordings
were
used
to
assess
the
ability
of
the
SSRI
fluvoxamine
to
modulate
the
clearance
of
locally
applied
serotonin
in
the
CA3
region
of
hippocampus
in
drug
-
or
vehicle
-
treated
rats
.

Fluvoxamine
decreased
the
clearance
of
serotonin
in
rats
treated
with
vehicle
,
DMI
,
or
phenelzine
but
had
no
effect
on
the
clearance
of
serotonin
in
SSRI
-
treated
rats
.

SERT
density
in
the
CA3
region
of
the
hippocampus
of
the
same
rats
,
assessed
by
quantitative
autoradiography
with
tritiated
cyanoimipramine
(
[
(
3
)
H
]
CN
-
IMI
)
,
was
decreased
by
80
-
90
%
in
SSRI
-
treated
rats
but
not
in
those
treated
with
phenelzine
or
DMI
.

The
serotonin
content
of
the
hippocampus
was
unaffected
by
paroxetine
or
sertraline
treatment
,
ruling
out
neurotoxicity
as
a
possible
explanation
for
the
SSRI
-
induced
decrease
in
SERT
binding
and
alteration
in
5
-
HT
clearance
.

Levels
of
mRNA
for
the
SERT
in
the
raphe
nucleus
were
also
unaltered
by
chronic
paroxetine
treatment
.

Based
on
these
results
,
it
appears
that
the
SERT
is
downregulated
by
chronic
administration
of
SSRIs
but
not
other
types
of
antidepressants
;
furthermore
,
the
downregulation
is
not
caused
by
decreases
in
SERT
gene
expression
.

)
,
are
thought
to
be
attributable
to
cyclooxygenase

.

Rofecoxib
specifically
inhibits
COX

and
has
demonstrated
a
low
potential
for
causing

This
study
sought
to
examine
the
feasibility
of
prolonged
assessment
of
acetylcholinesterase
(
AChE
)
activity
in
the
cerebrospinal
fluid
(
CSF
)
of
volunteers
and
to
test
the
hypothesis
that
rivastigmine
(
ENA
-
713
;
Exelon
,
Novartis
Pharma
AG
,
Basel
,
Switzerland
)
selectively
inhibits
AChE
in
CSF
in
humans
at
a
dose
producing
minimal
inhibition
of
the
peripheral
enzyme
.

Lumbar

were
collected
continuously
(

for
49

from
eight
healthy

who
took
either

or
a
single

of
rivastigmine
(

mg
)
.

CSF
specimens

were
performed
23
hours
after

were
obtained
from

was
lower
than
the
quantification

for
assay
(
0

.

Only
minimal
inhibition
of
erythrocyte
AChE
activity
(
approximately
3
%
)
was
observed
.

Inhibition
of
AChE
in
the
CSF
after
rivastigmine
administration
was
significantly
greater
than
after
placebo
for
up
to
8
.
4
hours
after
the
dose
and
was
maximal
(
40

)
at
2

4
hours
.

Plasma
BuChE
activity
was
significantly
lower
after
rivastigmine
than
after
placebo
,
but
this
was
not
clinically
relevant
.

BuChE
activity
in
CSF
was
significantly
lower
after
rivastigmine
than
after
placebo
for
up
to
3
.
6
hours
after
dosing
,
but
this
difference
was
not
sustained
.

This
study
confirms
the
feasibility
of
using
continuous
measurement
of
AChE
activity
in
CSF
over
prolonged
periods
,
that
rivastigmine
markedly
inhibits
CSF
AChE
after
a
single
oral
dose
of
3
mg
,
and
that
the
inhibition
of
central
AChE
is
substantially
greater
than
that
of
peripheral
AChE
or
BuChE
.

To
identify
key
amino
acids
involved
in
factor
IX
activation
,
recombinant
factor
XIa
proteins
containing
alanine
substitutions
for
wild

type
sequence
were
expressed
in
293
fibroblasts
and
tested
in
a
plasma

assay
.

Substitutions
for

(

and
Ser
(

at

and
for
Ser
(

-
Ser
(
264
)
at
the
C
terminus
of
the
A3
domain
markedly
decreased
factor

coagulant
activity
.

The
plasma
protease
prekallikrein
is
structurally
homologous
to
factor
XI
,
but
activated
factor
IX
poorly
.

A
chimeric
factor
XIa
molecule
with
the
A3
domain
replaced
with
A3
from
prekallikrein
(
FXI

)
activated
factor
IX
with
a
K
(
m
)
35
-
fold
greater
than
that
of
wild

type
factor
XI
.

FXI
/
PKA3
was
used
as
a
template
for
a
series
of
proteins
in
which
prekallikrein
A3
sequence
was
replaced
with
factor
XI
sequence
to
restore
factor
IX
activation
.

Clotting
and
kinetics
studies
using
these
chimeras
confirmed
the
results
obtained
with
alanine
mutants
.

Amino
acids
between
Ile
(
183
)
and
Val
(
191
)
are
necessary
for
proper
factor
IX
activation
,
but
additional
sequence
between
Ser
(

)
and
Ile
(
197
)
or
between
Phe
(
260
)
and
Ser
(

is
required
for
complete
restoration
of
activation

Vasopeptidase
inhibition
with
omapatrilat
improves
cardiac
geometry
and
survival
in
cardiomyopathic
hamsters
more
than
does
ACE
inhibition
with
captopril
.

Vasopeptidase
inhibitors
are
single
molecules
that
inhibit
neutral
endopeptidase
(
NEP
)
and
angiotensin
-
converting
enzyme
(
ACE
)
simultaneously
.

Omapatrilat
,
the
first
in
this
new
class
of
cardiovascular
agents
,
potentiates
vasodilatory
and
cardioprotective
peptides
and
represses
angiotensin
II
.

This
study
compared
the
effects
of
omapatrilat
with
those
of
a
pure
ACE
inhibitor
on
cardiac
geometry
and
survival
in
animals
with
heart
failure
.

BIO
TO
-
2
cardiomyopathic
hamsters
(
CMHs
)
in
the
early
stages
of
dilated
heart
failure
were
treated
with
vehicle
or
maximal
ACE
inhibitory
doses
of
captopril
(
750
micromol
/
kg
/
day
)
or
omapatrilat
(
200
micromol
/
kg
/
day
)
.

Prolonged
vasopeptidase
inhibition
increased
median
survival
time
after
the
start
of
treatment
by
99
and
31
%
compared
with
vehicle
and
captopril
,
respectively
(
median
survival
times
:
146
,
221
,
and
290
days
with
vehicle
,
captopril
,
and
omapatrilat
,
respectively
;
p
<
0
.
001
for
all
comparisons
)
.

In
similar
CMHs
,
captopril
or
omapatrilat
administered
for
2
months
significantly
(
p
<
0
.
05
)
decreased
heart
weight
,
pulmonary
congestion
(
lung
weight
)
,
and
left
ventricular
(
LV
)
chamber
volume
compared
with
vehicle
.

Omapatrilat
significantly
increased
LV
mass
-
to
-
volume
ratio
compared
with
vehicle
and
captopril
.

Omapatrilat
,
but
not
captopril
,
significantly
increased
urinary
atrial
natriuretic
peptide
excretion
,
indicating
NEP
inhibition
.

Thus
vasopeptidase
inhibition
with
omapatrilat
was
more
effective
than
ACE
inhibition
with
captopril
in
preventing
changes
in
LV
geometry
and
premature
mortality
in
hamsters
with

In
this

,
two
different
contraceptive
regimes
(
Mircette
,
a
monophasic
oral
contraceptive
and
Implanon
,
a
long

,
there
was
a
significant
increase
(

in
glandular

immunoreactivity
and
a
significant
decrease
(

05
)
in
PR
immunoreactivity
in
the
mid

There
was
a

,
P

)
between
stromal

immunoreactivity
and
endothelial

.

This
correlation
was
also
apparent
during
treatment
with
Implanon
,
but
not
with
Mircette
.

Disrupted
bleeding
patterns
were
associated
with
Implanon
and
,
to
a
lesser
extent
,
with
Mircette
.

Both
contraceptives
significantly
reduced
glandular
VEGF
immunoreactivity
.

Implanon
significantly
increased
(

,
but

significantly
reduced
(

.

There
were

In

are

In
distinction
to

,
fluparoxan
shows
only

actions
at
h5

HT
(
1A
)
sites
versus
marked
antagonist
actions
at

(

-
ARs
.

While
fluparoxan
selectively
enhances
hippocampal
noradrenaline
(
NAD
)
turnover
,
yohimbine
also
enhances
striatal
dopamine
(
DA
)
turnover
and
suppresses
striatal
turnover
of
5
-
HT
.

Further
,
yohimbine
decreases
firing
of
serotonergic
neurones
in
raphe
nuclei
,
an
action
reversed
by
WAY100
,

.

Fluparoxan
increases
extracellular
levels
of
DA
and
NAD
,
but
not
5

HT
,
in
frontal
cortex
.

In
analogy
,
yohimbine
enhances
FCX
levels
of
DA
and
NAD
,
yet
suppresses
those
of
5
-
HT
,
the
latter
effect
being
antagonized
by

635
.

The
induction
by
fluoxetine
of
FCX
levels
of
5
-
HT
,
DA
,
and
NAD
is
potentiated
by
fluparoxan
.

Yohimbine
likewise
facilitates
the
influence
of
fluoxetine
upon
DA
and
NAD
levels
,
but
not
those
of
5
-
HT
.

In
conclusion
,
the
alpha
(
2
)
-
AR
antagonist
properties
of
yohimbine
increase
DA
and
NAD
levels
both
alone
and
in
association
with
fluoxetine
.

However
,
in
contrast
to
the
selective
alpha
(

)
-
AR
antagonist
,
fluparoxan
,
the
5
-
HT
(
1A
)
agonist
actions
of
yohimbine
suppress
5

HT
levels
alone
and
underlie
its
inability
to
augment
the
influence
of
fluoxetine
upon
5

HT
levels
.

Pharmacological
and
ocular
hypotensive
properties
of
topical
carbonic
anhydrase
inhibitors
.

There
was
a
time
gap
of
over
40
years
between
the
demonstrated
oral
effectiveness
of
acetazolamide
in
lowering
the
intraocular
pressure
(
IOP
)
of
glaucoma
patients
and
the
introduction
of
a
topical
carbonic
anhydrase
(
CA
)
inhibitor
.

This
is
due
to
the
fact
that
CA
-
II
,
the
isoenzyme
which
most
likely
plays
an
important
role
in
the
production
of
aqueous
humor
in
humans
,
must
be
essentially
inhibited
by
100
%
to
elicit
a
pharmacological
response
.

The
lack
of
success
with
earlier
attempts
to
obtain
a
topical
agent
stems
from
an
inability
to
attain
and
maintain
a
sufficiently
high
intraocular
concentration
of
drug
to
achieve
the
required
inhibition
of
CA
.

Dorzolamide
and
brinzolamide
are
two
topical
CA
inhibitors
which
are
currently
available
to
treat
ocular
hypertension
and
/
or
glaucoma
.

Dorzolamide
is
a
very
potent
inhibitor
of
CA
-
II
and
its
site
of
action
is
local
within
the
eye
.

Like
oral
CA
inhibitors
,
topically
applied
dorzolamide
lowers
IOP
by
decreasing
the
production
of
aqueous
humor
.

The
drug
is
used
in
monotherapy
as
a
2
%
solution
administered
three
times
daily
.

Its
ocular
hypotensive
effect
is
comparable
to
that
of
timolol
at
peak
but
is
somewhat
less
at
trough
.

The
IOP
lowering
effect
of
timolol
is
enhanced
by
the
twice
daily
administration
of
2
%
dorzolamide
either
concomitantly
or
in
combination
.

Topically
applied
dorzolamide
is
generally
well
tolerated
and
had
a
low
drop
-
out
rate
in
clinical
studies
.

The
most
frequent
ocular
adverse
experience
is
burning
and
/
or
stinging
.

Corneal
and
lenticular
problems
have
generally
not
been
encountered
with
long
-
term
therapy
with
dorzolamide
.

Topically
applied
dorzolamide
penetrates
directly
to
the
posterior
segment
of
the
eye
and
its
presence
is
consistent
with
the
initial
report
that
dorzolamide
increases
retinal
blood
flow
velocity
in
patients
with
normal
tension
glaucoma
.

The
most
frequent
systemic
adverse
experience
is
a
transient
bitter
taste
.

Biochemical
changes
indicative
of
the
systemic
inhibition
of
CA
have
not
been
observed
in
monotherapy
studies
lasting
up
to
2
years
.

This
is
in
harmony
with
the
inability
of
dorzolamide
at
steady
-
state
to
saturate
CA
in
the
red
blood
cell
and
the
failure
to
detect
its
presence
in
plasma
.

A
1
%
suspension
of
brinzolamide
is
comparable
to
2
%
dorzolamide
in
lowering
IOP
,
both
drugs
being
administered
three
times
daily
.

Although
brinzolamide
has
a
lower
incidence
of
burning
/
stinging
,
it
elicits
more
blurred
vision
.

Microvessel
density
and
endothelial
cell
proliferation
after
amifostine
(
Ethyol
)
administration
in
vivo
.

BACKGROUND
:
As
amifostine
is
rapidly
metabolised
by
the
membrane
-
bound
and
capillary
alkaline
phosphatase
to
the
active
metabolite
WR
-
1065
,
microvessel
density
in
normal
and
cancer
tissue
may
influence
the
therapeutic
potential
of
the
pro

drug
WR
-
2721
.

Thus
,
it
is
of
interest
how
the
administration
of
amifostine
itself
alters
vascular
density
.

MATERIALS

METHOD
:
For

There
was

Biochemically
based
design
of
cyclooxygenase

2
(
COX

2
)
inhibitors
:
facile
conversion
of
nonsteroidal
antiinflammatory
drugs
to
potent
and
highly
selective
COX
-
2
inhibitors
.

All
nonsteroidal
antiinflammatory
drugs
(
NSAIDs
)
inhibit
the
cyclooxygenase
(
COX
)
isozymes
to
different
extents
,
which
accounts
for
their
anti
-
inflammatory
and
analgesic
activities
and
their
gastrointestinal
side
effects
.

We
have
exploited
biochemical
differences
between
the
two
COX
enzymes
to
identify
a
strategy
for
converting
carboxylate
-
containing
NSAIDs
into
selective
COX
-
2
inhibitors
.

Derivatization
of
the
carboxylate
moiety
in
moderately
selective
COX
-
1
inhibitors
,
such
as
5
,
8
,
11
,
14
-
eicosatetraynoic
acid
(
ETYA
)
and
arylacetic
and
fenamic
acid
NSAIDs
,
exemplified
by
indomethacin
and
meclofenamic
acid
,
respectively
,
generated
potent
and
selective
COX
-
2
inhibitors
.

In
the
indomethacin
series
,
esters
and
primary
and
secondary
amides
are
superior
to
tertiary
amides
as
selective
inhibitors
.

Only
the
amide
derivatives
of
ETYA
and
meclofenamic
acid
inhibit
COX
-
2
;
the
esters
are
either
inactive
or
nonselective
.

Inhibition
kinetics
reveal
that
indomethacin
amides
behave
as
slow
,
tight
-
binding
inhibitors
of
COX
-
2
and
that
selectivity
is
a
function
of
the
time
-
dependent
step
.

Site
-
directed
mutagenesis
of
murine
COX
-
2
indicates
that
the
molecular
basis
for
selectivity
differs
from
the
parent
NSAIDs
and
from
diarylheterocycles
.

Selectivity
arises
from
novel
interactions
at
the
opening
and
at
the
apex
of
the
substrate
-
binding
site
.

Lead
compounds
in
the
present
study
are
potent
inhibitors
of
COX
-
2
activity
in
cultured
inflammatory
cells
.

Furthermore
,
indomethacin
amides
are
orally
active
,
nonulcerogenic
,
anti
-
inflammatory
agents
in
an
in
vivo
model
of
acute
inflammation
.

Expansion
of
this
approach
can
be
envisioned
for
the
modification
of
all
carboxylic
acid
-
containing
NSAIDs
into
selective
COX
-
2
inhibitors
.

indicating
that
the

The

,
a

but
not
that
of

These
studies
provide
compelling
evidence
that
the
antitussive
effects
of
SB

in
this
guinea

are

COX

-
specific
inhibition
:
implications
for
clinical
practice
.

Although
conventional
nonsteroidal
anti
-
inflammatory
drugs
(
NSAIDs
)
have
long
been
a
major
therapeutic
choice
for
the
management
of
arthritic
conditions
,
the
potential
adverse
effects
of
these
agents
sometimes
compromise
their
clinical
utility
.

New
modes
of
therapy
have
recently
been
introduced
,
and
data
on
the
cyclooxygenase
-
2
(
COX
-
2
)
-
specific
inhibitors
celecoxib
and
rofecoxib
suggest
that
these
agents
will
meet
the
need
for
safe
and
effective
therapeutic
alternatives
to
conventional
NSAIDs
.

A
review
of
recent
advances
on
the
regulation
of
pigmentation
in
the
human
epidermis
.

It
has
been
recognised
that
the
active
transport
of
L
-
phenylalanine
and
its
autocrine
turnover
to
L
-
tyrosine
via
phenylalanine
hydroxylase
in
the
cytosol
of
epidermal
melanocytes
provides
the
majority
of
the
L
-
tyrosine
pool
for
melanogenesis
.

In
this
context
,
it
has
been
shown
that
the
cofactor
6
(
R
)
-
L
-
erythro
5
,
6
,
7
,
8
tetrahydrobiopterin
(
6BH4
)
is
produced
de
novo
,
recycled
and
regulated
in
both
epidermal
melanocytes
and
keratinocytes
to
control
tyrosine
hydroxylase
,
phenylalanine
hydroxylase
and
tyrosinase
activity
.

Inhibition
of
the
enzymes
by
excessive
6BH4
levels
is
reversible
with
alpha
-
MSH
by
specific
complex
formation
between
6BH4
and
the
hormone
.

This
direct
mechanism
of
alpha
-
MSH
is
supported
by
the
presence
of
the
entire
POMC
processing
system
in
the
melanosome
indicating
a
receptor
independent
control
of
eumelanogenesis
.

Finally
,
the
role
of
tyrosinase
,
TRP
-
1
and
TRP2
is
discussed
in
association
with
oxidative
stress

related
to
hydrogen

New
prospects
in
the
treatment
of
migraine
]
.

The
options
for
migraine
treatment
have
increased
in
the
recent
years
and
will
expand
in
the
near
future
.

In
this
work
both
recent
and
future
options
for
migraine
treatment
are
critically
reviewed
.

Firstly
the
late
advances
in
the
symptomatic
treatment
of
migraine
,
including
the
new
5
-
HT1B
/
D
agonists
"
triptans
"
appeared
after
sumatriptan
,
are
reviewed
.

Possible
alternative
,
such
as
selective
5
-
HT1D
and
5
-
HT1F
agonists
,
are
also
discussed
.

In
the
second
part
of
this
manuscript
the
new
,
possible
options
for
the
preventive
treatment
of
migraine
comprising
"
antiepileptics
"
,
such
as
valproic
acid
,
gabapentin
and
topiramate
,
calcium
-
antagonists
,
such
as
cyclandelate
and
dotarizin
,
and
a
miscellany
,
including
riboflavin
,
are
analysed
.

Finally
,
possible
compounds
for
the
future
,
such
as
the
selective
inhibitors
of
neurokinin
receptors
or
drugs
acting
upon
neuronal
calcium
channels
,
are
commented
.

From
this
review
we
conclude
that
while
there
have
been
relevant
advances
in
the
symptomatic
treatment
of
migraine
,
there
is
a
need
for
the
development
of
better
preventive
compounds

Sodium
channel
blockers
identify
risk
for
sudden
death
in
patients
with
ST
-
segment
elevation
and
right
bundle
branch
block
but
structurally
normal
hearts
.

BACKGROUND
:
A
mutation
in
the
cardiac
sodium
channel
gene
(
SCN5A
)
has
been
described
in
patients
with
the
syndrome
of
right
bundle
branch
block
,
ST
-
segment
elevation
in
leads
V1
to
V3
,
and
sudden
death
(
Brugada
syndrome
)
.

These
electrocardiographic
manifestations
are
transient
in
many
patients
with
the
syndrome
.

The
present
study
examined
arrhythmic
risk
in
patients
with
overt
and
concealed
forms
of
the
disease
and
the
effectiveness
of
sodium
channel
blockers
to
unmask
the
syndrome
and
,
thus
,
identify
patients
at
risk
.

METHODS
AND
RESULTS
:
The
effect
of
intravenous
ajmaline
(
1
mg
/
kg
)
,
procainamide
(
10
mg
/
kg
)
,
or
flecainide
(
2
mg
/
kg
)
on
the
ECG
was
studied
in
34
patients
with
the
syndrome
and
transient
normalization
of
the
ECG
(
group
A
)
,
11
members
of
3
families
in
whom
a
SCN5A
mutation
was
associated
with
the
syndrome
and
8
members
in
whom
it
was
not
(
group
B
)
,
and
53
control
subjects
(
group
C
)
.

Ajmaline
,
procainamide
,
or
flecainide
administration
resulted
in
ST
-
segment
elevation
and
right
bundle
branch
block
in
all
patients
in
group
A
and
in
all
11
patients
with
the
mutation
in
group
B
.

A
similar
pattern
could
not
be
elicited
in
the
8
patients
in
group
B
who
lacked
the
mutation
or
in
any
person
in
group
C
.

The
follow
-
up
period
(
37
+
/
-
33
months
)
revealed
no
differences
in
the
incidence
of
arrhythmia
between
the
34
patients
in
whom
the
phenotypic
manifestation
of
the
syndrome
was
transient
and
the
24
patients
in
whom
it
was
persistent
(

.

CONCLUSIONS
:
The
data
demonstrated
a
similar
incidence
of
potentially
lethal
arrhythmias
in
patients
displaying
transient
versus
persistent
ST
-
segment
elevation
and
right
bundle
branch
block
,
as
well
as
the
effectiveness
of
sodium
channel
blockers
to
unmask
the
syndrome
and
,
thus
,
identify
patients
at
risk
.

Determinants
of
voltage
-
dependent
inactivation
affect
Mibefradil
block
of
calcium
channels
.

The
voltage
gated
calcium
channel
family
is
a
major
target
for
a
range
of
therapeutic
drugs
.

Mibefradil
(
Ro
40
-
5967
)
belongs
to
a
new
chemical
class
of
these
molecules
which
differs
from
other
Ca2
+
antagonists
by
its
ability
to
potently
block
T
-
type
Ca2
+
channels
.

However
,
this
molecule
has
also
been
shown
to
inhibit
other
Ca2
+
channel
subtypes
.

To
further
analyze
the
mechanism
governing
the
Ca2
+
channel
-
Mibefradil
interaction
,
we
examined
the
effect
of
Mibefradil
on
various
recombinant
Ca2
+
channels
expressed
in
mammalian
cells
from
their
cloned
cDNAs
,
using
Ca2
+
as
the
permeant
ion
at
physiological
concentration
.

Expression
of
alpha1A
,
alpha1C
,
and
alpha1E
in
tsA
201
cells
resulted
in
Ca2
+
currents
with
functional
characteristics
closely
related
to
those
of
their
native
counterparts
.

Mibefradil
blocked
alpha1A
and
alpha1E
with
a
Kd
comparable
to
that
reported
for
T
-
type
channels
,
but
had
a
lower
affinity
(
approximately
30
-
fold
)
for
alpha1C
.

For
each
channel
,
inhibition
by
Mibefradil
was
consistent
with
high
-
affinity
binding
to
the
inactivated
state
.

Modulation
of
the
voltage
-
dependent
inactivation
properties
by
the
nature
of
the
coexpressed
beta
subunit
or
the
alpha1
splice
variant
altered
block
at
the
Mibefradil
receptor
site
.

Therefore
,
we
conclude
that
the
tissue
and
sub
-
cellular
localization
of
calcium
channel
subunits
as
well
as
their
specific
associations
are
essential
parameters
to
understand
the
in
vivo
effects
of
Mibefradil
.

Streptokinase

antistreptokinase
antibodies
and

.

Streptokinase
activates
platelets
,
limiting
its
effectiveness
as
a
thrombolytic
agent
.

The
role
of
antistreptokinase
antibodies
and
proteases
in
streptokinase
-
induced
platelet
activation
was
investigated
.

Streptokinase
induced
localization
of

to
the
platelet

,
platelet
aggregation
,
and

.

These
effects
were
inhibited
by
a
monoclonal
antibody

the
platelet
Fc

.

The
platelet
response
to

Streptokinase

Polysulfated
heparinoids
selectively
inactivate
heparin
-
binding
angiogenesis
factors
.

Angiogenesis
is
a
prerequisite
for

expansion
and

.

The
angiogenic
potential
of
the
heparin

growth
factors
acidic
fibroblast
growth
factor
(
FGF
)
and
basic
FGF
has
been
demonstrated
in
various
publications
.

We
studied
the
inhibitory
effects
of
suramin
and
the
polysulfated
heparinoids
pentosan
polysulfate
,
dextran
sulfate
,
and
fucoidan
on
the
action
of
FGF
.

As
an
experimental
model
,
we
used
the
adrenal
cancer
cell
line
SW
13
,
whose
anchorage
-
independent
growth
depends
on
the
presence
of
FGF
.

The
polysulfated

inhibited

growth
and
binding
to
the
receptor
at
an
IC50
of

-
3
micrograms

.

Suramin
inhibited
FGF
at
an
IC50
of
100

/

.

The
polysulfated
heparinoids
exerted
no
effect
on
IGF

or

growth
.

Suramin
inhibited
the
anchorage

growth
induced
by
IGF
-
1
or
TGF
alpha
only
at
an
IC50
of
100
micrograms
/

.

Our
results
indicate
that
suramin
inhibits
growth
factors
in
a
nonselective
way
.

By
contrast
,
polysulfated
heparinoids
exert
a
selective
inhibitory
effect
on
heparin
binding
angiogenesis
factors
at
an
IC50
,
which
is
100
times
below
the
IC50
of

.

Therefore
,
the
administration
of
polysulfated

might
become
a

Use
of
tranexamic
acid
for
an
effective
blood
conservation
strategy
after
total
knee
arthroplasty
.

We
have
investigated
the
effect
of
treatment
with
tranexamic
acid
,
an
inhibitor
of
fibrinolysis
,
on
blood
loss
,
blood

requirements
and

in
a
randomized
,
double

-
controlled
study
of
42
patients
after
total
knee

.

Tranexamic

or
an
equivalent
volume
of
normal

(
n

was
given
30
min
before
surgery
and
subsequently
every
8
h
for
3
days
.

Coagulation
and
fibrinolysis
values
,
blood
loss
and
blood
units
administered
were
measured
before
administration
of
tranexamic
acid
,
8
h
after
the
end
of
surgery
and
at
24
and
72
h
after
operation
.

Coagulation

was
examined
(

.

Fibrinolysis
was
evaluated
by
measurement
of
concentrations
of
D

dimer
and
fibrinogen
degradation
products
(
FDP
)
.

Total
blood

in
the
tranexamic

group
was
678
(

compared
with
1419
(
607
)
ml
in
the
control
group
(
P

)
,
and
occurred
primarily
during
the
first
24
h
after

.

Thirteen

,
who
received

.

Postoperative
packed

values
were
higher
in
the
tranexamic

group
despite
fewer

.

Postoperative

of
plasminogen
were
decreased
significantly
in
the

Nitric
oxide
synthase
expression
in
the
opossum
superior
colliculus
:
a
histochemical
,
immunohistochemical
and
biochemical
study
.

The
expression
of
neuronal
nitric
oxide
synthase
(
nNOS
)
in
the
superior
colliculus
(
SC
)
of
the
opossum
Didelphis
marsupialis
was
studied
by
NADPH
diaphorase
(
NADPH
-
d
)
histochemistry
and
nNOS
immunohistochemistry
.

In
addition
,
the
activity
of
nNOS
was
quantified
by
measurement
of
[
(
3
)
H
]
-
L
-
arginine
conversion
to
[
(
3
)
H
]
-
L
-
citrulline
in
tissue
extracts
from
SC
superficial
layers
in
opossums
and
rats
.

Our
results
show
that
the
number
of
NADPH
-
d
stained
cells
was
small
and
virtually
identical
in
stratum
opticum
(
SO
)
and
stratum
griseum
superficiale
(
SGS
)
and
their
staining
was
very
light
,
particularly
in
SGS
.

Neuropil
staining
was
heavier
in
the
stratum
zonale
(
SZ
)
than
in
SGS
or
SO
.

The
intermediate
and
deep
layers
contained
heavily
stained
cells
and
moderate
neuropil
staining
.

Surprisingly
,
nNOS
-
immunoreactive
cells
were
far
more
numerous
than
NADPH
-
d
+
cells
in
every
layer
.

The
production
of
[
(
3
)
H
]
-
L
-
citrulline
from
[
(
3
)
H
]
-
L
-
arginine
in
tissue
extracts
enriched
in
superficial
layers
indicated
that
nNOS
specific
activity
is
as
high
in
the
opossum
as
in
the
rat
.

Our
results
suggest
that
the
location
of
nNOS
-
expressing
neurons
in
retino
-
receptive
layers
may
be
related
to
inter
-
specific
differences
in
the
processing
of

.

Correlations
between
serotonin
level
and
single
-
cell
firing
in
the
rat
'
s
nucleus
raphe
magnus
.

The
relation
between
serotonin
release
and
electrical
activity
was
examined
in
the
nucleus
raphe
magnus
of
rats
anesthetized
with
pentobarbital
.

Serotonin
levels
were
monitored
through
a
carbon
-
fiber
microelectrode
by
fast
cyclic
voltammetry
(
usually
at
1
Hz
)
.

Single
-
cell
firing
was
recorded
through
the
same
microelectrode
,
except
during
the
voltammetry
waveform
and
associated
electrical
artifact
(
totaling
about
30
ms
)
.

Multi
-
barrel
micropipettes
incorporating
the
voltammetry
electrode
were
used
for
iontophoresis
of
drugs
.

Cells
were
inhibited
,
excited
or
unaffected
by
noxious
mechanical
skin
stimulation
.

These
were
respectively
designated
as
off
(
M
)
cells
,
on
(
M
)
cells
and
neutral
(
M
)
cells
,
M
denoting
mechanical
.

During
3
min
of
pinching
,
serotonin
slowly
rose
near
seven
of
14
on
(
M
)
cells
and
26
of
46
off
(
M
)
cells
;
it
fell
near
two
off
(
M
)
cells
;
it
was
unchanged
near
all
other
cells
,
including
six
neutral
(
M
)
cells
.

On
a
finer
spatiotemporal
scale
,
near
four
of
seven
on
(
M
)
cells
,
10
of
14
off
(
M
)
cells
and
0
of
four
neutral
(
M
)
cells
,
average
serotonin
levels
fell
significantly
within
+
/
-
100
ms
of
spontaneous
spikes
.

Lower
serotonin
may
have
caused
the
higher
spike
probability
;
the
converse
is
theoretically
unlikely
,
since
delays
between
release
and
detection
are
estimated
to
exceed
100
ms
.

Increased
serotonin
and
decreased
firing
were
always
seen
following
iontophoresis
or
intravenous
injection
(
1
mg
/
kg
)
of
the
serotonin
re
-
uptake
inhibitor
clomipramine
(
n
=
7
)
.

Iontophoresis
of
+
/
-
propranolol
,
whose
serotonergic
actions
include
antagonism
and
partial
agonism
at
5
-
HT1
receptors
,
also
increased
serotonin
and
decreased
firing
(
n
=
4
)
.

Methiothepin
(
intravenous
,
1
mg
/
kg
)
,
whose
serotonergic
actions
include
5
-
HT1
and
5
-
HT2
antagonism
,
typically
raised
serotonin
levels
(
four
of
five
cells
)
and
always
blocked
inhibition
by
clomipramine
(
n
=
3
)
.

Iontophoresis
of
glutamate
always
lowered
serotonin
and
increased
firing
(
n
=
4
)
.

Since
serotonin
levels
and
firing
were
usually
inversely
correlated
,
except
near
on
(
M
)
cells
during
pinch
,
we
propose
that
serotonin
is
released
from
terminals
of
incoming
nociceptive
afferents
.

Prior
neuroanatomical
knowledge
favors
a
midbrain
origin
for
these
afferents
,
while
some
of
the
drug
findings
suggest
that
their
terminals
possess
inhibitory
serotonergic
autoreceptors
,
possibly
of
5
-
HT1b
subtype
.

The
released
serotonin
could
contribute
to
the
inhibition
of
off
(
M
)
cells
and
excitation
of
on
(
M
)
cells
by
noxious
stimulation
,
since
inhibitory
5
-
HT1a
receptors
and
excitatory
5
-
HT2
receptors
,
respectively
,
have
previously
been
shown
to
dominate
their
serotonergic
responses
.

Abnormal
fatty
acid
pattern
in
rheumatoid
arthritis
.

A
rationale
for
treatment
with
marine
and
botanical
lipids
.

OBJECTIVE
:
To
assess
the
fatty
acid
pattern
in
plasma
and
synovial
fluid
(
SF
)
in
rheumatoid
arthritis
(
RA
)
and
to
determine
clinical
factors
related
to
possible
abnormalities
.

METHODS
:
Thirty
-
nine
patients
with
RA
were
included
.

SF
samples
were
obtained
from
9
patients
.

Disease
activity
was
assessed
using
the
Ritchie
Articular
Index
and
erythrocyte
sedimentation
rate
.

Fatty
acids
were
assayed
with
gas
liquid
chromatography
.

RESULT
:
Decreased
levels
of
eicosapentaenoic
acid
(
p
<
0
.
0001
)
and
total
n3
polyunsaturated
fatty
acids
(
p
<
0
.
05
)
were
observed
in
plasma
and
in
joint
fluid
,
respectively
.

An
increase
of
the
substrates
of
delta
-
5
-
desaturase
(
C20
:
3n6
and
C20
:
2n6
)
and
decrease
of
their
products
(
C20
:
4n6
and
C22
:
4n6
)
was
observed
in
plasma
total
lipids
and
phospholipids
.

The
long
chain
mono
-
unsaturated
fatty
acids
(
C20
:
1n9
,
C22
:
1n9
,
C24
:
ln9
)
were
increased
in
the
joint
fluid
and
in
plasma
phospholipids
.

Patients
with
active
disease
showed
a
mild
decrease
of
several
saturated
fatty
acids
,
n3
,
and
n6
polyunsaturated
fatty
acids
.

Minor
abnormalities
or
no
changes
in
fatty
acid
profile
were
found
related
to
use
of
steroids
,
nonsteroidal
antiinflammatory
drugs
,
and
gold
salts
,
or
malnutrition
.

CONCLUSION
:
The
fatty
acid
pattern
found
in
RA
(
decreased
levels
of
n3
polyunsaturated
fatty
acids
)
may
explain
the
beneficial
effect
of
fish
oil
.

Changes
in
n6
polyunsaturated
fatty
acids
suggest
that
delta
-
5
desaturation
is
decreased
and
this
might
facilitate
the
antiinflammatory
effect
of
botanical
lipids
in
RA
.

Selective
inhibition
of
monoamine
neurotransmitter
transporters
by
synthetic
local
anesthetics
.

Synthetic
local
anesthetics
(
LAs
)
have
been
found
to
have
cocaine
-
like
characteristics
with
some
psychotomimetic
action
,
possibly
through
monoaminergic
neurotransmission
.

To
gain
insight
into
the
relation
between
LA
action
and
monoamine
transporters
,
we
investigated
the
effect
of
synthetic
LAs
on
neurotransmitter
transporters
,
including
monoamine
transporters
.

We
used
cloned
transporter
cDNAs
and
examined
transient
functional
expression
in
COS
cells
and
stable
expression
in
HeLa
cells
.

Among
the
LAs
tested
,
procaine
and
other
ester
-
type
LAs
inhibited
[
3H
]
DA
uptake
and
binding
of
[
3H
]
2
-
beta
-
carbomethoxy
-
3
-
beta
-
(
4
-
fluorophenyl
)
tropane
(
CFT
)
,
a
cocaine
analogue
,
in
COS
cells
expressing
rat
dopamine
transporter
(
DAT
)
.

The
inhibition
was
concentration
-
dependent
.

The
inhibitory
effect
on
[
3H
]
DA
uptake
was
reversible
and
not
dependent
on
pH
,
as
observed
in
HeLa
cells
stably
expressing
DAT
.

Procaine
also
inhibited
uptake
of
norepinephrine
(
NE
)
and
serotonin
(
5
-
HT
)
by
the
norepinephrine
transporter
(
NET
)
or
serotonin
transporter
(
SERT
)
expressed
in
COS
cells
.

On
the
other
hand
,
procaine
and
other
LAs
had
little
or
no
effect
on
[
3H
]
GABA
and
[
3H
]
glutamate
uptake
in
COS
cells
expressing
mouse
GABA
or
rat
glutamate
/
aspartate
transporter
.

IC50
values
for
[
3H
]
DA
uptake
inhibition
correlated
well
with
those
for
[
3H
]
CFT
binding
inhibition
,
but
not
with
intrinsic
anesthetic
potency
.

Kinetic
analysis
of
monoamine
uptake
inhibition
by
procaine
in
COS
cells
expressing
rat
DAT
,
NET
or
SERT
revealed
a
competitive
action
similar
to
that
of
cocaine
.

These
results
demonstrate
that
certain
LAs
selectively
inhibit
monoamine
transporters
.

This
might
contribute
to
the
cocaine
-
like
psychotomimetic
action
of
certain
LAs
.

Estrogen
receptor
-
alpha
gene
transfer
into
bovine
aortic
endothelial
cells
induces
eNOS
gene
expression
and
inhibits
cell
migration
.

OBJECTIVES
:
It
has
been
suggested
that
estrogen
may
improve
endothelial
cell
function
to
delay
the
onset
of
atherosclerosis
in
pre
-
menopausal
females
,
though
its
mechanism
of
action
is
not
fully
understood
.

We
examined
the
hypothesis
that
human
estrogen
receptor
-
alpha
(
ER
alpha
)
gene
transfection
improves
the
endothelial
cell
function
.

METHODS
:
A
replication
deficient
adenoviral
vector
was
used
to
transfect
the
ER
alpha
gene
into
bovine
aortic
endothelial
cells
(
BAEC
)
and
a
GFP
gene
containing
vector
was
used
as
control
.

Expression
of
the
eNOS
gene
was
determined
by
Northern
blot
analysis
and
enzyme
activity
assay
;
cell
migration
was
assayed
using
a
Transwell
apparatus
;
and
tyrosine
phosphorylation
of
FAK
was
estimated
by
Western
blot
analysis
.

RESULTS
:
ER
alpha
gene
transfection
of
endothelial
cells
produced
a
2
-
3
-
fold
increase
in
eNOS
mRNA
and
protein
levels
as
well
as
a
significant
increase
(
P
<
0
.
05
)
in
NOS
activity
as
measured
by
citrulline
assay
and
nitrite
accumulation
in
the
media
in
response
to
bradykinin
stimulation
.

Treatment
of
cells
with
estrogen
blocking
agent
ICI
182780
inhibited
eNOS
induction
in
response
to
ER
alpha
transfection
.

ER
alpha
gene
transfection
significantly
inhibited
(
P
<
0
.
05
)
bFGF
-
induced
chemotactic
migration
of
endothelial
cells
but
increased
cell
attachment
to
fibronectin
,
laminin
,
and
type
I
and
IV
collagens
.

ER
alpha
gene
transfer
also
inhibited
bFGF
-
stimulated
tyrosine
phosphorylation
of
FAK
.

CONCLUSION
:
Our
results
suggest
that
the
atheroprotective
effects
of
estrogen
may
in
part
be
mediated
by
ER
alpha
-
induced
upregulation
of
eNOS
gene
expression
and
maintenance
of
endothelial
cell
function
and
integrity
.

The
Hsp90
-
specific
inhibitor
geldanamycin
selectively
disrupts
kinase
-
mediated
signaling
events
of
T
-
lymphocyte
activation
.

The
90
-
kDa
heat
shock
protein
(
Hsp90
)
is
the
most
abundant
molecular
chaperone
of
eukaryotic
cells
.

Its
chaperone
function
in
folding
nascent
proteins
seems
to
be
restricted
to
a
subset
of
proteins
including
major
components
of
signal
transduction
pathways
(
eg
,
nuclear
hormone
receptors
,
transcription
factors
,
and
protein
kinases
)
.

Improper
function
of
these
proteins
can
be
induced
by
selective
disruption
of
their
complexes
with
Hsp90
using
the
benzoquinonoid
ansamycin
geldanamycin
.

In
this
study
,
we
demonstrate
that
geldanamycin
treatment
blocks
interleukin
(
IL
)
-
2
secretion
,
IL
-
2
receptor
expression
,
and
proliferation
of
stimulated
T
-
lymphocytes
.

Moreover
,
geldanamycin
decreases
the
amount
and
phosphorylation
of
Lck
and
Raf
-
1
kinases
and
prevents
activation
of
the
extracellular
signal
regulated
kinase
(
ERK
)
-
2
kinase
.

Geldanamycin
also
disrupts
the
T
-
cell
receptor
-
mediated
activation
of
nuclear
factor
of
activated
T
-
cells
(
NF
-
AT
)
.

Treatment
with
geldanamycin
,
however
,
does
not
affect
the
activation
of
lysophosphatide
acyltransferase
,
which
is
a
plasma
membrane
enzyme
coupled
to
the
T
-
cell
receptor
after
T
-
cell
stimulation
.

Through
demonstrating
the
selective
inhibition
of
kinase
-
related
T
-
lymphocyte
responses
by
geldanamycin
,
our
results
emphasize
the
substantial
role
of
Hsp90
-
kinase
complexes
in
T
-
cell
activation
.

Prevention

-

.

BACKGROUND
:
In
previous
studies
of
cynomolgus
monkey
lung
allograft
recipients
,
we
demonstrated
significant
immunosuppressive
efficacy
but
reduced
tolerability
after
combined
treatment
with
high
doses
of
microemulsion

and

RAD
(
40

.

The
current

was
designed
to
compare
efficacy
and

of
a

of
low

METHODS
:
Twelve

Recipients
were
observed
for
49
days
by
daily
weight

,
hemograms
,

,
radiographs
,
and
lung

.

Monkeys
were
euthanized
before

in
the
event
of
excessive

.

Target
CsA
trough

in
the
CD25
group
.

RESULTS
:
None
of
the
monkeys
in
the
CD25
group
needed
to
be
euthanized
early
due
to
signs
of
drug
toxicity
.

In
contrast
,
four
monkeys
in
the
CTL
group
were
sacrificed
on
days

as
a
result
of
excessive

.

Three

in
the
CD25
group
were
euthanized
on
days
36
,
38
,
and
46
as
a
result
of
persistent
high

in
the
CD25
group
(

.

The
only
two
long

survivors
in
the
CTL

showed
moderate
rejection
at
day
49
.

The
median
rejection
scores
at
day
14
(
A0
)
and
day
28
(
A2

were
identical
in
the
two
groups
,
despite
the
fact
that
the
mean
SDZ

was
significantly
lower
in
the
CD25
group
(

.

After
basiliximab
levels
fell
below
the

on
day
28
,
the
median

CONCLUSION
:
This
is
the
first

to
combine
an
anti

with
a
drug
from
the
rapamycin

CsA
.

Our
study
shows
that
induction
therapy
with
basiliximab
enabled
SDZ
RAD
blood
levels
to
be
significantly
reduced
,
which
led
to
improved
tolerability
without
the
penalty
of
increased
rejection

activated
both

In

Similarly
,

In
the

Interactions
of
the
human

proteins
MRP1
and
MRP2
with
organic
anions
.

The
human
multidrug
resistance
protein
MRP1
and
its
homolog
,
MRP2
,
are
both
suggested
as
being
involved
in
cancer
drug
resistance
and
the
transport
of
organic
anions
.

We
expressed
MRP1
and
MRP2
in
Spodoptera
frugiperda
ovarian
cells
and
compared
their
ATP
-
dependent
transport
properties
and
vanadate
-
sensitive
ATPase
activities
in
isolated
membrane
vesicles
.

Both
MRP1
and
MRP2
actively
transported
leukotriene
C
(
4
)
and
N
-
ethylmaleimide
glutathione
(
NEM
-
GS
)
,
although
the
relative
affinity
of
MRP2
for
these
substrates
was
found
to
be
significantly
lower
than
that
of
MRP1
.

Methotrexate
was
actively
transported
by
both
proteins
,
although
more
efficiently
by
MRP2
.

ATP
-
dependent
NEM
-
GS
transport
by
MRP1
and
MRP2
was
variably
modulated
by
organic
anions
.

Probenecid
and
furosemide
inhibited
,
whereas
under
certain
conditions
sulfinpyrazone
,
penicillin
G
,
and
indomethacin
greatly
stimulated
,
MRP2
-
mediated
NEM
-
GS
uptake
.

Vanadate
-
sensitive
ATPase
activity
in
isolated
membranes
containing
MRP1
or
MRP2
was
significantly
stimulated
by
NEM
-
GS
and
reduced
GS
,
although
these
compounds
acted
only
at
higher
concentrations
in
MRP2
.

ATP
hydrolysis
by
MRP2
was
also
effectively
stimulated
by
methotrexate
.

Probenecid
,
sulfinpyrazone
,
indomethacin
,
furosemide
,
and
penicillin
G
all
significantly
increased
MRP2
-
ATPase
activity
,
whereas
these
compounds
acted
more
as
ATPase
inhibitors
on
MRP1
.

These
results
indicate
that
MRP1
is
a
more
efficient
transporter
of
glutathione
conjugates
and
free
glutathione
than
MRP2
,
whereas
several
anions
are
preferred
substrates
for
MRP2
.

Our
data
suggest
that
MRP2
may
be
responsible
for
the
active
secretion
of
pharmacologically
relevant
organic
anions
,
such
as
diuretics
and
antibiotics
,
and
indicate
different
modulation
possibilities
for
MRP1

Aspirin
and
sodium
salicylate
inhibit
endothelin
ETA
receptors
by
an
allosteric
type
of
mechanism
.

Aspirin
is
a
commonly
used
drug
with
a
wide
pharmacological
spectrum
including
antiplatelet
,
anti
-
inflammatory
,
and
neuroprotective
actions
.

This
study
shows
that
aspirin
and
sodium
salicylate
,
its
major
blood
metabolite
,
reverse
contractile
actions
of
endothelin
-
1
(
ET
-
1
)
in
isolated
rat
aorta
and
human
mammary
arteries
.

They
also
prevent
the
intracellular
Ca
(

)
mobilizing
action
of
ET
-
1
in
cultured
endothelial
cells
but
not
those
of
neuromedin
B
or
UTP
.

Inhibition
of
the
actions
of
ET
-

by
salicylates
is
apparently
competitive
.

Salicylates
inhibit
(

ET
-
1
ETA
receptor
complexes
both
in
the
absence
and
the
presence
of
unlabeled

.

It
has
no
influence
on
the
rate
of
association
of
(
125
)
I

ET

1
to
ETA

.

Salicylates
do
not
promote

Salicylates
potentiate

.

It
is
concluded
that
salicylates
are
allosteric
inhibitors
of
ETA
receptors
.

The
results
also
suggest
that

limits
actions
of

,
whereas
affinity
for
meperidine
was
greatly
reduced
at
alkaline
pH
.

Furthermore
,
interaction
of
meperidine
with
Mg
(
2
+
)
block
was
reduced
at
alkaline
pH
.

Because
the
percentage
of
the
protonated
form
of
meperidine
is
only
slightly
affected
by
pH
,
changes
in
properties
of
the
meperidine
binding
site
may
be
involved
in
mechanisms
of
alteration
of
meperidine
potency
by
pH
.

IMPLICATIONS
:
At
acidic
pH
the
potency
of
meperidine
for
N
-
methyl
-
D
-
aspartate
-
receptor
channels
was
increased
.

Any
antinociceptive
and
neuroprotective
benefit
from
the
N
-
methyl
-
D
-
aspartate
-
receptor
antagonist
property
of
meperidine
may
be
pH
dependent
.

Statins
:
effective
antiatherosclerotic
therapy
.

BACKGROUND
:
Statins
are
the
most
effective
agents
currently
available
for
lowering
plasma
levels
of
low
-
density
lipoprotein
cholesterol
(
LDL
-
C
)
and
are
the
mainstay
of
therapy
for
hyperlipidemia
.

The
statins
are
highly
liver
-
selective
,
inhibiting
3
-
hydroxy
-
3
-
methylglutaryl
-
coenzyme
A
(
HMG
-
CoA
)
reductase
,
a
key
enzyme
in
the
synthesis
of
cholesterol
.

Several
large
,
controlled
clinical
trials
have
confirmed
significant
reductions
in
rates
of
coronary
heart
disease
morbidity
and
death
with
long
-
term
statin
therapy
in
patients
with
mild
to
severe
hypercholesterolemia
.

METHODS
AND
RESULTS
:
This
review
article
is
based
on
a
literature
search
of
more
than
60
relevant
articles
from
peer
-
reviewed
journals
.

Search
engines
included
Medline
and
Embase
.

In
surveying
clinical
and
angiographic
evidence
,
we
found
that
statins
appear
to
reduce
the
incidence
of
coronary
events
by
slowing
the
progression
of
atherosclerosis
and
preventing
atheromatous
lesion
formation
.

We
found
that
the
6
statins
currently
marketed
-
atorvastatin
,
cerivastatin
,
fluvastatin
,
lovastatin
,
pravastatin
,
and
simvastatin
-
differ
in
their
inhibitory
action
on
the
HMG
-
CoA
reductase
enzyme
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
The
use
of
more
potent
statins
such
as
atorvastatin
and
simvastatin
affords
greater
lowering
of
LDL
-
C
and
triglyceride
levels
,
allowing
more
patients
to
achieve
target
goals
.

The
question
of
how
low
LDL
-
C
levels
should
be
lowered
will
be
answered
by
ongoing
clinical
trials
.

A
unique
cytosolic
activity
related
but
distinct
from
NQO1
catalyses
metabolic
activation
of
mitomycin
C
.

Mitomycin
C
(
MMC
)
is
a
prototype
bioreductive
drug
employed
to
treat
a
variety
of
cancers
including
head
and
neck
cancer
.

Among
the
various
enzymes
,
dicoumarol
inhibitable
cytosolic
NAD
(
P
)
H
:
quinone
oxidoreductase1
(
NQO1
)
was
shown
to
catalyse
bioreductive
activation
of
MMC
leading
to
cross
-
linking
of
the
DNA
and
cytotoxicity
.

However
,
the
role
of
NQO1
in
metabolic
activation
of
MMC
has
been
disputed
.

In
this
report
,
we
present
cellular
and
animal
models
to
demonstrate
that
NQO1
may
play
only
a
minor
role
in
metabolic
activation
of
MMC
.

We
further
demonstrate
that
bioreductive
activation
of
MMC
is
catalysed
by
a
unique
cytosolic
activity
which
is
related
but
distinct
from
NQO1
.

Chinese
hamster
ovary
(
CHO
)
cells
were
developed
that
permanently
express
higher
levels
of
cDNA
-
derived
NQO1
.

These
cells
showed
significantly
increased
protection
against
menadione
toxicity
.

However
,
they
failed
to
demonstrate
higher
cytotoxicity
due
to
exposure
to
MMC
under
oxygen
(
normal
air
)
or
hypoxia
,
as
compared
to
the
wild
-
type
control
CHO
cells
.

Disruption
of
the
NQO1
gene
by
homologous
recombination
generated
NQO1
-
/
-
mice
that
do
not
express
the
NQO1
gene
resulting
in
the
loss
of
NQO1
protein
and
activity
.

The
cytosolic
fractions
from
liver
and
colon
tissues
of
NQO1
-
/
-
mice
showed
similar
amounts
of
DNA
cross
-
linking
upon
exposure
to
MMC
,
as
observed
in
NQO1
+
/
+
mice
.

The
unique
cytosolic
activity
that
activated
MMC
in
cytosolic
fractions
of
liver
and
colon
tissues
of
NQO1
-
/
-
mice
was
designated
as
cytosolic
MMC
reductase
.

This
activity
,
like
NQO1
,
was
inhibited
by
dicoumarol
and
immunologically
related
to
NQO1
.

High
affinity
blockade
of
the
HERG
cardiac
K
(
+
)
channel
by
the
neuroleptic
pimozide
.

Pimozide
is
an
antipsychotic
agent
also
used
to
treat
facial
tics
.

Pimozide
can
cause
acquired
long
QT
syndrome
and
ventricular
arrhythmias
.

To
elucidate
the
mechanism
behind
these
clinical
findings
,
we
examined
the
effects
of
pimozide
on
the
cloned
human
cardiac
K
(
+
)
channels
HERG
(
human
ether
-
a
-
go
-
go
-
related
gene
;
rapid
component
of
delayed
rectifier
)
,
Kv1
.
5
(
ultra
-
rapid
delayed
rectifier
)
and
KvLQT1
/
minK
(
slow
component
of
delayed
rectifier
)
.

Using
patch
clamp
electrophysiology
,
we
found
that
pimozide
was
a
potent
inhibitor
of
HERG
displaying
an
IC
(
50
)
value
of
18
nM
.

In
contrast
,
pimozide
(
10
microM
)
was
a
weak
inhibitor
of
KvLQT1
/
minK
and
Kv1
.
5
.

We
conclude
that
pimozide
is
a
specific
,
high
affinity
antagonist
of
HERG
,
and
that
this
interaction
leads
to
prolongation
of
cardiac
repolarization
.

Effect
of
L
-
arginine
-
nitric
oxide
system
on
the
metabolism
of
essential
fatty
acids
in
chemical
-
induced
diabetes
mellitus
.

Several
studies
have
shown
that
the
activities
of
delta
-
6
-
desaturase
and
delta
-
5
-
desaturase
are
depressed
in
experimental
diabetes
and
in
humans
with
insulin
-
and
non
-
insulin
-
dependent
diabetes
mellitus
(
type
I
and
type
II
diabetes
mellitus
respectively
)
.

Furthermore
,
treatment
with
insulin
is
known
to
correct
the
defects
in
desaturases
in
rats
and
humans
with
diabetes
,
especially
in
type
I
.

In
a
recent
study
,
we
demonstrated
that
L
-
arginine
and
nitric
oxide
can
prevent
alloxan
-
induced
beta
cell
damage
,
and
the
severity
of
diabetes
,
and
restore
the
antioxidant
status
to
near
normal
levels
.

But
,
no
information
is
available
as
to
the
relationship
between
L
-
arginine
-
nitric
oxide
system
and
the
metabolism
of
essential
fatty
acids
in
diabetes
mellitus
.

In
the
present
study
,
it
was
noted
that
the
plasma
levels
of
saturated
fatty
acids
:
stearic
and
palmitic
were
increased
where
as
unsaturated
fatty
acids
such
as
oleic
,
linoleic
,
gamma
-
linolenic
and
eicosapentaenoic
acids
(
OA
,
LA
,
GLA
and
EPA
respectively
)
were
decreased
in
alloxan
-
induced
diabetic
rats
.

In
the
liver
phospholipid
(
PL
)
fraction
,
GLA
,
DGLA
(
dihomo
-
GLA
)
and
alpha
-
linolenic
acid
(
ALA
)
were
decreased
in
the
alloxan
-
treated
group
;
in
the
muscle
PL
fraction
,
LA
,
GLA
and
DGLA
were
low
,
whereas
an
increase
in
the
saturated
fatty
acid
content
was
noted
.

L
-
arginine
(
the
precursor
of
nitric
oxide
)
and
sodium
nitroprusside
(
a
nitric
oxide
donor
)
treatment
of
alloxan
-
induced
diabetic
rats
enhanced
the
levels
of
LA
,
GLA
and
DGLA
.

Further
,
nitric
oxide
synthase
inhibitor
,
L
-
NMMA
,
prevented
this
beneficial
action
of
L
-
arginine
-
nitric
oxide
system
on
essential
fatty
acid
metabolism
.

The
abnormalities
in
the
essential
fatty
acid
metabolism
observed
also
reverted
to
normalcy
following
control
of
diabetes
with
insulin
.

These
results
indicate
that
nitric
oxide
can
enhance
the
activities
of
delta
-
6
-
and
delta
-
5
desaturases
,
which
are
depressed
in
diabetes
,
and
suggests
that
there
is
a
close
interaction
between
L
-
arginine
-
nitric
oxide
system
and
the
metabolism
of
essential
fatty
acids
.

concentrations
are
characteristic
for
subjects

METHODS
:
We
used
two
models

CONCLUSION
/
INTERPRETATION
:
This
study
provides
evidence
that
troglitazone
reduces
PAI
-
1
production
in
human
adipocytes
,
probably
at
the
transcriptional
level
.

This
observation
could
point
to
a
new

effect
of
troglitazone
,
particularly
in
obese
subjects
,
which
could
be
associated

Topiramate
as
an
inhibitor
of
carbonic
anhydrase
isoenzymes
.

PURPOSE
:
This
study
investigated
the
effectiveness
of
topiramate
(
TPM
)
as
an
inhibitor
of
six
isozymes
of
carbonic
anhydrase
(
CA
)
.

METHODS
:
The
inhibition
constants
(
Ki
)
of
TPM
and
acetazolamide
(
AZM
)
for
CA
I
,
CA
II
,
CA
III
,
CA
IV
,
CA
V
,
and
CA
VI
were
determined
for
human
(
HCA
)
,
rat
(
RCA
)
,
or
mouse
(
MCA
)
.

The
activity
of
CA
was
studied
by
using
purified
isozymes
,
erythrocytes
,
subcellular
fractions
of
kidney
or
brain
,
and
saliva
,
and
was
assayed
at
37
degrees
C
or
25
degrees
C
by
18O
mass
spectrometry
and
/
or
by
measuring
the
pH
shift
at
0
degrees
C
.

RESULTS
:
Topiramate
Ki
values
for
HCA
I
,
HCA
II
,
HCA
IV
,
and
HCA
VI
were
approximately
100
,
7
,
10
,
and
>
100
microM
,
respectively
.

TPM
Ki
values
for
RCA
I
,
RCA
II
,
RCA
III
,
RCA
IV
,
and
RCA
V
were
approximately
180
,
0
.
1
to
1
,
>
100
,
0
.
2
to
10
and
18
microM
,
respectively
.

For
RCA
II
and
RCA
IV
,
the
Ki
values
were
temperature
dependent
.

TPM
Ki
values
for
MCA
II
and
MCA
IV
ranged
between
1
and
20
microM
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
These
results
indicate
that
TPM
is
more
potent
as
an
inhibitor
of
CA
II
and
CA
IV
than
of
CA
I
,
CA
III
,
and
CA
VI
.

In
all
three
species
,
AZM
was
usually
10
to
100
times
more
potent
than
TPM
as
an
inhibitor
of
CA
isozymes
.

)
significantly
decreased

Tamsulosin
(

decreased
urethral

as
did
JTH

,
but
with
a
significant
effect
on

.

JTH
-
601
showed
higher
selectivity
for
canine
prostate
both
in

and
in

.

In
prostate
,
an
important
role
of
the
alpha

)
-
adrenoceptor
is
suggested
in
the
smooth
muscle
contraction
mediated
by
alpha

adrenoceptors
.

JTH
-
601
is
expected
to
be
an
effective
alpha
(

)
-
adrenoceptor
antagonist
for
the
treatment
of

-
mediated
neuronal
cell
death
in
primary
cortical

.

Cyclooxygenase
isozymes
(
COX

1
and
COX
-
2
)
are
found
to
be
constitutively
expressed
in
brain
,
with
neuronal
expression
of
COX
-
2
being
rapidly
induced
after
numerous
insults
,
including
cerebral
ischemia
.

Because
overactivation
of
N
-
methyl
-
D
-
aspartate
(
NMDA
)
receptors
has
been
implicated
in
the
cell
loss
associated
with
ischemia
,
we
characterized
the
expression
of
the
COX
isozymes
in
murine
mixed
cortical
cell
cultures
and
used
isozyme

selective
inhibitors
to
determine
their
relative
contribution
to

stimulated
prostaglandin
(

)
production
and
excitotoxic

death
.

Immunocytochemical
analysis
of
mixed
cortical
cell
cultures
revealed
that
COX
-
2
expression
was
restricted
to
neurons
,
whereas
COX
-
1
was
expressed
in
both
neurons
and
astrocytes
.

Brief
exposure
to
NMDA
(
5
min
;
100
microM
)
elicited
a
time
-
dependent
accumulation
of
PGs
in
the
culture
medium
that
preceded
neuronal
cell
death
and
correlated
with
the
induction
of
COX
-
2
mRNA
.

COX
-
1
expression
remained
unchanged
.

Flurbiprofen
,
a
nonselective
COX
-
1
/
COX
-
2
inhibitor
,
blocked
NMDA
-
stimulated
PG
production
and
attenuated
neuronal
death
in
a
concentration
-
dependent
manner
.

Similar
results
were
obtained
with
the
specific
COX
-
2
inhibitor
NS
-
398
(
10
-
30
microM
)
but
not
with
the
selective
COX
-
1
inhibitor
valeryl
salicylate
(
10
-
300
microM
)
.

Inhibition
of
total
constitutive
COX
activity
with
aspirin
(
100
microM
,
1
.
5
h
)
before
NMDA
exposure
did
not
prevent
subsequent
NMDA
-
mediated
neuronal
cell
death
.

However
,
neuronal
injury
in
aspirin
-
pretreated
cultures
was
attenuated
by
flurbiprofen
administration
after
NMDA
exposure
.

Finally
,
the
protection
afforded
by
COX
-
2
inhibition
was
specific
for
NMDA
because
neither
flurbiprofen
nor
NS
-
398
protected
neurons
against
kainate
-
mediated
neurotoxicity
.

Together
,
these
results
support
the
conclusion
that
newly
synthesized
COX
-
2
protein
contributes
to
NMDA
-
induced
neuronal
injury
.

Inhibition
of
the
human
intermediate
conductance
Ca
(
2
+
)
-
activated
K
(
+
)
channel
,
hIK1
,
by
volatile
anesthetics
.

Ca
(
2
+
)
-
activated
K
(
+
)
channels
(
K
(
Ca
)
)
regulate
a
wide
variety
of
cellular
functions
by
coupling
intracellular
Ca
(
2
+
)
concentration
to
membrane
potential
.

There
are
three
major
groups
of
K
(
Ca
)
classified
by
their
unit
conductances
:
large
(
BK
)
,
intermediate
(
IK
)
,
and
small
(
SK
)
conductance
of
channels
.

BK
channel
is
gated
by
combined
influences
of
Ca
(
2
+
)
and
voltage
,
while
IK
and
SK
channels
are
gated
solely
by
Ca
(
2
+
)
.

Volatile
anesthetics
inhibit
BK
channel
activity
by
interfering
with
the
Ca
(
2
+
)
gating
mechanism
.

However
,
the
effects
of
anesthetics
on
IK
and
SK
channels
are
unknown
.

Using
cloned
IK
and
SK
channels
,
hIK1
and
hSK1
-
3
,
respectively
,
we
found
that
the
currents
of
hIK1
were
inhibited
rapidly
and
reversibly
by
volatile
anesthetics
,
whereas
those
of
SK
channels
were
not
affected
.

The
IC
(
50
)
values
of
the
volatile
anesthetics
,
halothane
,
sevoflurane
,
enflurane
,
and
isoflurane
for
hIK1
inhibition
were
0
.
69
,
0
.
42
,
1
.
01
and
1
.
03
mM
,
respectively
,
and
were
in
the
clinically
used
concentration
range
.

In
contrast
to
BK
channel
,
halothane
inhibition
of
hIK1
currents
was
independent
of
Ca
(
2
+
)
concentration
,
suggesting
that
Ca
(
2
+
)
gating
mechanism
is
not
involved
.

These
results
demonstrate
that
volatile
anesthetics
,
such
as
halothane
,
enflurane
,
isoflurane
,
and
sevoflurane
,
affect
BK
,
IK
,
and
SK
channels
in
distinct
ways
.

Characterization
of
phentermine
and
related
compounds
as
monoamine
oxidase
(
MAO
)
inhibitors
.

Phentermine
was
shown
in
the
1970s
to
inhibit
the
metabolism
of
serotonin
by
monoamine
oxidase
(
MAO
)
,
but
never
was
labeled
as
an
MAO
inhibitor
;
hence
,
it
was
widely
used
in
combination
with
fenfluramine
,
and
continues
to
be
used
,
in
violation
of
their
labels
,
with
other
serotonin
uptake
blockers
.

We
examined
the
effects
of
phentermine
and
several
other
unlabeled
MAO
inhibitors
on
MAO
activities
in
rat
lung
,
brain
,
and
liver
,
and
also
the
interactions
of
such
drugs
when
administered
together
.

Rat
tissues
were
assayed
for
MAO
-
A
and
-
B
,
using
serotonin
and
beta
-
phenylethylamine
as
substrates
.

Phentermine
inhibited
serotonin
-
metabolizing
(
MAO
-
A
)
activity
in
all
three
tissues
with
K
(
i
)
values
of
85
-
88
microM
.

These
potencies
were
similar
to
those
of
the
antidepressant
MAO
inhibitors
iproniazid
and
moclobemide
.

When
phentermine
was
mixed
with
other
unlabeled
reversible
MAO
inhibitors
(
e
.
g
.
pseudoephedrine
,
ephedrine
,
norephedrine
;
estradiol
benzoate
)
,
the
degree
of
MAO
inhibition
was
additive
.

The
cardiac
valvular
lesions
and
primary
pulmonary
hypertension
that
have
been
reported
to
be
associated
with
fenfluramine
-
phentermine
use
may
have
resulted
from
the
intermittent
concurrent
blockage
of
both
serotonin
uptake
and
metabolism
.

Comparison

.

AIM
:
To
compare
candesartan
cilexetil
and
lisinopril
in
fixed
combination
with
hydrochlorothiazide
with
respect
to
antihypertensive

.

METHODS
:
This
was
a
double

comparison
in
patients
with
a
mean

for
26
weeks
.

The
primary

variable
was

.

RESULTS
:
Changes
in

did
not
differ
significantly
between

.

Both
drugs
were
well

but
the
proportion
of
patients
with
at

was
significantly
greater
in
the

)
was
also
higher
in
the
lisinopril

compared
with
the

.

CONCLUSIONS
:
The
fixed
combinations
of
candesartan

NADH

dihydropteridine
reductase
.

In
mammals
dietary
ferric
iron
is
reduced
to
ferrous
iron
for
more
efficient
absorption
by
the
intestine
.

Analysis
of
a

fraction
revealed
two
NADH
-
dependent
ferric
reductase
activities
,
one
associated
with
a
b

cytochrome
and
the
other
not
.

Purification
and
characterization
of
the
non

cytochrome
ferric

identified
a
31
kDa
protein
.

MALDI
-
MS
analysis
and
amino
acid
sequencing
identified
the
ferric
reductase
as
being
related
to
the
26
kDa
liver
NADH
-
dependent
quinoid
dihydropteridine
reductase
(
DHPR
)
.

The
NADH
-
dependent
DHPR
ferric
reductase
activity
was
found
to
be
pteridine
-
independent
since
exhaustive
dialysis
did
not
reduce
activity
and
heat

destroyed
activity
.

In
intestinal
Caco
-
2
cells
,
DHPR
mRNA
levels
were
found
to
be
regulated
by
iron
.

Thus
,
DHPR
appears
to
be
a
dual

,
a
NADH

and
an

Irbesartan
:
review
of
pharmacology
and
comparative
properties
.

The
recently
developed
and
marketed
angiotensin
II
type
1
(
AT1
)
receptor
blockers
(
ARBs
)
have
demonstrated
efficacy
equivalent
to
that
of
other
leading
classes
of
antihypertensive
agents
,
with
superior
tolerability
profiles
.

The
specific
targeting
of
the
AT1
receptor
afforded
by
these
agents
has
demonstrated
more
complete
blockade
of
the
renin
-
angiotensin
system
than
that
offered
by
angiotensin
-
converting
enzyme
inhibitors
.

These
data
notwithstanding
,
differentiation
within
the
class
of
ARBs
has
been
limited
.

With
the
accumulation
of
additional
data
with
ARBs
,
it
has
recently
become
possible
to
make
within
-
class
distinctions
,
based
in
large
part
on
the
individual
pharmacological
profiles
of
the
ARBs
.

To
this
end
,
absorption
,
distribution
,
half
-
life
,
dose
response
and
level
of
angiotensin
II
antagonism
are
of
special
note
.

When
these
properties
are
viewed
as
a
group
,
the
ARB
irbesartan
appears
to
offer
advantages
beyond
those
attained
with
other
ARBs
.

Irbesartan
is
well
absorbed
,
does
not
require
biotransformation
to
an
active
metabolite
to
exert
its
antihypertensive
activity
,
offers
a
large
volume
of
distribution
,
has
a
half
-
life
that
is
sufficient
to
allow
once
-
daily
dosing
,
is
associated
with
a
strong
and
consistent
dose
-
response
and
has
been
demonstrated
to
provide
a
level
of
angiotensin
II
antagonism
that
is
statistically
superior
to
that
offered
by
some
other
ARBs
.

These
pharmacological
differences
may
explain
the
clinical
superiority
of
irbesartan
compared
with
losartan
,
the
first
member
of
the
ARB
class
.

As
even
more
data
on
the
ARBs
become
available
,
the
ability
to
determine
the
advantages
of
specific
members
of
this
class
will
be
enhanced
,
distinctions
that
already
have
begun
to
come
to
light
.

Amphetamine
-
induced
loss
of
human
dopamine
transporter
activity
:
an
internalization
-
dependent
and
cocaine
-
sensitive
mechanism
.

The
dopamine
transporter
(
DAT
)
is
a
target
of
amphetamine
(
AMPH
)
and
cocaine
.

These
psychostimulants
attenuate
DAT
clearance
efficiency
,
thereby
increasing
synaptic
dopamine
(
DA
)
levels
.

Re
-
uptake
rate
is
determined
by
the
number
of
functional
transporters
at
the
cell
surface
as
well
as
by
their
turnover
rate
.

Here
,
we
present
evidence
that
DAT
substrates
,
including
AMPH
and
DA
,
cause
internalization
of
human
DAT
,
thereby
reducing
transport
capacity
.

Acute
treatment
with
AMPH
reduced
the
maximal
rate
of
[
(
3
)
H
]
DA
uptake
,
decreased
AMPH
-
induced
currents
,
and
significantly
redistributed
the
immunofluorescence
of
an
epitope
-
tagged
DAT
from
the
plasma
membrane
to
the
cytosol
in
human
embryonic
kidney
293
cells
.

Conversely
,
DAT
inhibitors
,
such
as
cocaine
,
mazindol
,
and
nomifensine
,
when
administered
with
AMPH
,
blocked
the
reduction
in
[
(
3
)
H
]
DA
uptake
and
the
redistribution
of
DAT
immunofluorescence
to
the
cytosol
.

The
reductions
of
[
(
3
)
H
]
DA
uptake
and
AMPH
-
induced
DAT
internalization
also
were
inhibited
by
coexpression
of
a
dominant
negative
mutant
of
dynamin
I
(
K44A
)
,
indicating
that
endocytosis
modulates
transport
capacity
,
likely
through
a
clathrin
-
mediated
pathway
.

With
this
mechanism
of
regulation
,
acute
application
of
AMPH
would
reduce
DA
uptake
not
only
by
direct
competition
for
uptake
,
but
also
by
reducing
the
available
cell
-
surface
DAT
.

Moreover
,
AMPH
-
induced
internalization
might
diminish
the
amount
of
DAT
available
for
DA
efflux
,
thereby
modulating
the
cytotoxic
effects
of
elevated
extracellular
DA
.

Peroxisome
proliferator
-
activated
receptor
alpha
activators
improve
insulin
sensitivity
and
reduce
adiposity
.

Fibrates
and
glitazones
are
two
classes
of
drugs
currently
used
in
the
treatment
of
dyslipidemia
and
insulin
resistance
(
IR
)
,
respectively
.

Whereas
glitazones
are
insulin
sensitizers
acting
via
activation
of
the
peroxisome
proliferator
-
activated
receptor
(
PPAR
)
gamma
subtype
,
fibrates
exert
their
lipid
-
lowering
activity
via
PPARalpha
.

To
determine
whether
PPARalpha
activators
also
improve
insulin
sensitivity
,
we
measured
the
capacity
of
three
PPARalpha
-
selective
agonists
,
fenofibrate
,
ciprofibrate
,
and
the
new
compound
GW9578
,
in
two
rodent
models
of
high
fat
diet
-
induced
(
C57BL
/
6
mice
)
or
genetic
(
obese
Zucker
rats
)
IR
.

At
doses
yielding
serum
concentrations
shown
to
activate
selectively
PPARalpha
,
these
compounds
markedly
lowered
hyperinsulinemia
and
,
when
present
,
hyperglycemia
in
both
animal
models
.

This
effect
relied
on
the
improvement
of
insulin
action
on
glucose
utilization
,
as
indicated
by
a
lower
insulin
peak
in
response
to
intraperitoneal
glucose
in
ciprofibrate
-
treated
IR
obese
Zucker
rats
.

In
addition
,
fenofibrate
treatment
prevented
high
fat
diet
-
induced
increase
of
body
weight
and
adipose
tissue
mass
without
influencing
caloric
intake
.

The
specificity
for
PPARalpha
activation
in
vivo
was
demonstrated
by
marked
alterations
in
the
expression
of
PPARalpha
target
genes
,
whereas
PPARgamma
target
gene
mRNA
levels
did
not
change
in
treated
animals
.

These
results
indicate
that
compounds
with
a
selective
PPARalpha
activation
profile
reduce
insulin
resistance
without
having
adverse
effects
on
body
weight
and
adipose
tissue
mass
in
animal
models
of
IR
.

Recent
developments
in
receptor
-
selective
retinoids
.

Natural
(
all
trans
-
retinoic
acid
,
RA
)
and
synthetic
retinoids
exhibit
potent
anti
-
proliferative
,
normalization
of
differentiation
and
anti
-
inflammatory
activities
which
appear
to
account
for
their
therapeutic
effects
in
acne
,
psoriasis
,
photoaging
,
precancerous
lesions
and
established
cancers
.

Although
RA
has
shown
considerable
promise
in
dermatologic
indications
,
certain
side
effects
have
restricted
its

Systematic
synthesis
of
receptor
-
selective
retinoids
has
resulted
in
two
topical
drugs
,
Tazorac
/
Zorac
(
tazarotene
)
and
Differin
(
adapalene
)
.

Tazorac
is
indicated
for
psoriasis
and
acne
and
Differin
gel
for
the
treatment
of
acne
.

These
drugs
bind
to
the
retinoic
acid
receptor
(
RAR
)
family
members
.

Various
RAR
subtype
-
specific
and
function
-
selective
retinoids
have
been
synthesized
.

These
retinoids
,
which
are
in
various
stages
of
pre
-
clinical
development
for
the
treatment
of
cancers
,
psoriasis
and
as
an
antidote
to
Accutane
-
mediated
mucocutaneous
toxicity
,
will
also
be
discussed
in
this
review
.

Discovery
of
another
retinoid
receptor
,
retinoid
X
receptor
(
RXR
)
,
revealed
that
RXR
-
specific
retinoids
already
existed
in
retinoid
chemical
libraries
.

Structure
activity
relationship
studies
based
upon
binding
and
transactivation
assays
led
to
the
synthesis
of
RXR
-
specific
ligands
with
high
affinities
for
RXR
subtypes
.

These
compounds
were
found
to
be
effective
in
the
treatment
of
hyperglycemia
in
animal
models
of
type
II
diabetes
.

The
discovery
of
novel
retinoids
along
with
an
increased
understanding
of
the
biological
functions
and
mechanisms
of
action
of
retinoid
receptors
are
likely
to
result
in
improved
treatments
for
existing
responsive
indications
and
identification
of
new
retinoid
therapeutic
targets
.

Severe
impairment
of
salivation
in
Na
+
/
K
+
/
2Cl
-
cotransporter
(
NKCC1
)
-
deficient
mice
.

The
salivary
fluid
secretory
mechanism
is
thought
to
require
Na
(
+
)
/
K
(
+
)
/
2Cl
(
-
)
cotransporter
-
mediated
Cl
(
-
)
uptake
.

To
directly
test
this
possibility
we
studied
the
in
vivo
and
in
vitro
functioning
of
acinar
cells
from
the
parotid
glands
of
mice
with
targeted
disruption
of
Na
(
+
)
/
K
(
+
)
/
2Cl
(
-
)
cotransporter
isoform
1
(
Nkcc1
)
,
the
gene
encoding
the
salivary
Na
(
+
)
/
K
(
+
)
/
2Cl
(
-
)
cotransporter
.

In
wild
-
type
mice
NKCC1
was
localized
to
the
basolateral
membranes
of
parotid
acinar
cells
,
whereas
expression
was
not
detected
in
duct
cells
.

The
lack
of
functional
NKCC1
resulted
in
a
dramatic
reduction
(
>
60
%
)
in
the
volume
of
saliva
secreted
in
response
to
a
muscarinic
agonist
,
the
primary
in
situ
salivation
signal
.

Consistent
with
defective
Cl
(
-
)
uptake
,
a
loss
of
bumetanide
-
sensitive
Cl
(
-
)
influx
was
observed
in
parotid
acinar
cells
from
mice
lacking
NKCC1
.

Cl
(
-
)
/
HCO
(
3
)
(
-
)
exchanger
activity
was
increased
in
parotid
acinar
cells
isolated
from
knockout
mice
suggesting
that
the
residual
saliva
secreted
by
mice
lacking
NKCC1
is
associated
with
anion
exchanger
-
dependent
Cl
(
-
)
uptake
.

Indeed
,
expression
of
the
Cl
(
-
)
/
HCO
(
3
)
(
-
)
exchanger
AE2
was
enhanced
suggesting
that
this
transporter
compensates
for
the
loss
of
functional
Na
(
+
)
/
K
(
+
)
/
2Cl
(
-
)
cotransporter
.

Furthermore
,
the
ability
of
the
parotid
gland
to
conserve
NaCl
was
abolished
in
NKCC1
-
deficient
mice
.

This
deficit
was
not
associated
with
changes
in
the
morphology
of
the
ducts
,
but
transcript
levels
for
the
alpha
-
,
beta
-
,
and
gamma
-
subunits
of
the
epithelial
Na
(
+
)
channel
were
reduced
.

These
data
directly
demonstrate
that
NKCC1
is
the
major
Cl
(
-
)
uptake
mechanism
across
the
basolateral
membrane
of
acinar
cells
and
is
critical
for
driving
saliva
secretion
in
vivo
.

Induction
of
estrogen
receptor
-
alpha
and
-
beta
activities
by
synthetic
progestins
.

The
cellular
action
of
steroid
hormones
is
mediated
by
specific
receptors
.

Recently
,
two
different
estrogen
receptors
(
ER
)
,
alpha
and
beta
,
have
been
cloned
with
a
specific
tissue
distribution
.

Active
estrogen
as
well
as
active
progestin
are
compounds
of
oral
hormonal
contraceptives
and
hormone
replacement
therapy
.

To
examine
the
regulation
of
ER
-
alpha
and
-
beta
activities
after
treatment
with
synthetic
progestins
and
synthetic
and
natural
estrogens
,
COS
7
cells
were
transfected
with
the
vector
expressing
ER
-
alpha
and
-
beta
in
combination
with
a
luciferase
reporter
vector
.

ER
-
alpha
activity
was
upregulated
in
the
presence
of
synthetic
progestins
in
a
dose
-
dependent
manner
.

Norethisterone
,
norethynodrel
and
desogestrel
proved
to
be
the
most
potent
stimulatory
agents
of
ER
-
alpha
expression
.

On
the
other
hand
,
not
all
progestins
exhibited
a
stimulatory
action
on
ER
-
beta
activity
.

Only
norgestrel
,
levonorgestrel
,
norethynodrel
and
norethisterone
induced
ER
-
beta
-
activating
functions
in
a
dose
-
dependent
manner
.

Luciferase
activity
due
to
estrogen
stimulation
served
as
a
positive
control
.

Our
results
indicate
that
progestins
have
different
effects
on
the
activities
of
ER
-
alpha
and
-
beta
.

Na
(
+
)
-
dependent
transporters
mediate
HCO
(
3
)
(
-
)
salvage
across
the
luminal
membrane
of
the
main
pancreatic
duct
.

To
study
the
roles
of
Na
(
+
)
-
dependent
H
(
+
)
transporters
,
we
characterized
H
(
+
)
efflux
mechanisms
in
the
pancreatic
duct
in
wild
-
type
,
NHE2
(
-
/
-
)
,
and
NHE3
(
-
/
-
)
mice
.

The
pancreatic
duct
expresses
NHE1
in
the
basolateral
membrane
,
and
NHE2
and
NHE3
in
the
luminal
membrane
,
but
does
not
contain
NHE4
or
NHE5
.

Basolateral
Na
(
+
)
-
dependent
H
(
+
)
efflux
in
the
microperfused
duct
was
inhibited
by
1
.
5
microM
of
the
amiloride
analogue
HOE
694
,
consistent
with
expression
of
NHE1
,
whereas
the
luminal
activity
required
50
microM
HOE
694
for
effective
inhibition
,
suggesting
that
the
efflux
might
be
mediated
by
NHE2
.

However
,
disruption
of
NHE2
had
no
effect
on
luminal
transport
,
while
disruption
of
the
NHE3
gene
reduced
luminal
Na
(
+
)
-
dependent
H
(
+
)
efflux
by
approximately
45
%
.

Notably
,
the
remaining
luminal
Na
(
+
)
-
dependent
H
(
+
)
efflux
in
ducts
from
NHE3
(
-
/
-
)
mice
was
inhibited
by
50
microM
HOE
694
.

Hence
,
approximately
55
%
of
luminal
H
(
+
)
efflux
(
or
HCO
(
3
)
(
-
)
influx
)
in
the
pancreatic
duct
is
mediated
by
a
novel
,
HOE
694
-
sensitive
,
Na
(
+
)
-
dependent
mechanism
.

H
(
+
)
transport
by
NHE3
and
the
novel
transporter
is
inhibited
by
cAMP
,
albeit
to
different
extents
.

We
propose
that
multiple
Na
(
+
)
-
dependent
mechanisms
in
the
luminal
membrane
of
the
pancreatic
duct
absorb
Na
(
+
)
and
HCO
(
3
)
(
-
)
to
produce
a
pancreatic
juice
that
is
poor
in
HCO
(
3
)
(
-
)
and
rich
in
Cl
(
-
)
during
basal
secretion
.

Inhibition
of
the
transporters
during
stimulated
secretion
aids
in
producing
the
HCO
(
3
)
(
-
)
-
rich
pancreatic
juice
.

Improvement
of
cardiac
output
in
patients
with
severe
heart
failure
by
use
of
ACE
-
inhibitors
combined
with
the
AT1
-
antagonist
eprosartan
.

BACKGROUND
:
The
efficacy
of
ACE
-
inhibitor
therapy
is
well
documented
in
the
treatment
of
chronic
heart
failure
.

As
pharmacological
mechanisms
of
ACE
-
inhibition
and
angiotensin
II
AT1
-
receptor
-
antagonists
differ
,
an
additional
positive
effect
concerning
left
ventricular
function
can
be
expected
in
combining
both
classes
of
drugs
.

METHODS
:
Twenty
patients
(
64
.
9
+
/
-
8
.
5
years
)
with
advanced
chronic
heart
failure
(
NYHA
class
III
)
receiving
long
-
term
medication
with
digitalis
,
diuretics
and
ACE
-
inhibitors
were
randomized
to
either
eprosartan
(
540
+
/
-
96
mg
/
day
)
or
placebo
,
according
to
a
blinded
protocol
.

Hemodynamic
measurements
by
impedance
cardiography
were
performed
at
baseline
and
after
8
.
85
+
/
-
1
.

5
days
of
study
medication
treatment
.

RESULTS
:
Additional
treatment
with
eprosartan
resulted
in
a
higher
cardiac
output
than
in
the
control
group
(
P
<
0
.
05
)
.

While
in
the
active
treatment
group
cardiac
output
increased
significantly
from
baseline
(
2
.
27
-
3
.
24
l
/
min
,
P
=
0
.
039
)
,
there
was
no
change
in
the
control
group
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
The
additional
treatment
with
the
AT1
-
receptor
antagonist
eprosartan
,
given
to
severe
heart
failure
patients
,
who
received
digitalis
,
diuretics
and
ACE
-
inhibitors
,
resulted
in
a
beneficial
effect
by
increasing
cardiac
output
.

This
effect
may
be
due
to
eprosartan
'
s
additional
property
of
blocking
the
autocrine
interaction
of
locally
and
not
ACE
-
generated
angiotensin
II
with
their
respective
vascular
and
myocardial
AT1

receptors
as
well
as
the
influence
on
prejunctional
AT1
-
receptors
located
on
sympathetic
nerve
terminals
.

Gene
expression
of
the
phosphodiesterases
3A
and
5A
in
human
corpus
cavernosum
penis
.

OBJECTIVE
:
The
following
study
was
performed
to
evaluate
the
importance
of
phosphodiesterases
3A
(
PDE3A
)
and
5A
(
PDE5A
)
for
the
regulation
of
penile
smooth
muscle
tone
.

Furthermore
,
indications
of
side
effects
of
specific
inhibitors
in
certain
tissues
as
well
as
of
a
possible
relation
between
the
level
of
PDE3A
and
PDE5A
gene
expression
and
erectile
dysfunction
should
have
been
deduced
from
the
results
obtained
.

METHODS
:
Total
ribonucleic
acid
was
isolated
from
different
human
tissues
(
urogenital
tract
,
gastrointestinal
tract
,
cardiovascular
system
and
central
nervous
system
)
and
subjected
to
RTPCR
analysis
and
Northern
blotting
using
primers
and
probes
specific
for
PDE3A
and
PDE5A
.

RESULTS
:
As
shown
by
RT
-
PCR
and
Northern
blotting
,
PDE3A
and
PDE5A
mRNAs
exhibit
a
distinct
distribution
throughout
the
tissues
examined
but
were
2
-
fold
higher
in
cavernous
tissue
than
in
all
other
tissues
investigated
.

However
,
there
were
no
significant
differences
in
the
levels
of
gene
expression
between
the
two
subgroups
of
patients
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
Very
high
expression
levels
of
PDE3A
and
PDE5A
in
human
cavernous
tissue
underscore
the
physiological
importance
of
these
enzymes
for
the
regulation
of
penile
erection
,
emphasizing
their
therapeutical
and
pharmacological
relevance
.

The
distribution
pattern
of
the
mRNA
for
the
isoenzymes
PDE3A
and
PDE5A
may
explain
the
pharmacological
effects
as
well
as
the
side
effects
of
milrinone
and
sidenafil
.

Effects
of
troglitazone
on

.

Low
plasma
fibrinolytic
activity
in
association
with
increased
plasma
plasminogen

levels
has
been
linked
to
an
increased
risk
of
atherosclerosis
in
obesity
and
type

diabetes
.

We
tested
the
hypothesis
that
troglitazone
,
which
improves
insulin
sensitivity
and
lowers
plasma
insulin
levels
in

,
would
also
lower

before
and
after

months
of

)
.

At

,
plasma

after
an

were
significantly

in

Changes
in

.

The
extent
of
the
reduction
in
plasma
PAI
-
1
antigen
concentrations
in
the
diabetic
patients
after
troglitazone
correlated
with
the
reductions
in

insulin
(

)
but
not
with
the
improvement
in
glucose
disposal
rates
during
the
glucose
clamps
.

Three
nonresponders
to
troglitazone
with
respect
to
effects
on
insulin
sensitivity
and
fasting
glucose
and
insulin
levels
also
had
no
reduction
in

1
.

In
conclusion
,
troglitazone
enhances
fibrinolytic
system
activity
in
insulin
-
resistant
type
2
diabetic
patients
.

This
effect
appears
to
be
intimately
linked
to
its
potential
to
lower
plasma
insulin
levels
and
improve
glycemic
control
through
its

Tetrahydropterin
-
dependent
amino
acid
hydroxylases
.

Phenylalanine
hydroxylase
,
tyrosine
hydroxylase
,
and
tryptophan
hydroxylase
constitute
a
small
family
of
monooxygenases
that
utilize
tetrahydropterins
as
substrates
.

When
from
eukaryotic
sources
,
these
enzymes
are
composed
of
a
homologous
catalytic
domain
to
which
are
attached
discrete
N
-
terminal
regulatory
domains
and
short
C
-
terminal
tetramerization
domains
,
whereas
the
bacterial
enzymes
lack
the
N
-
terminal
and
C
-
terminal
domains
.

Each
enzyme
contains
a
single
ferrous
iron
atom
bound
to
two
histidines
and
a
glutamate
.

Recent
mechanistic
studies
have
begun
to
provide
insights
into
the
mechanisms
of
oxygen
activation
and
hydroxylation
.

Although
the
hydroxylating
intermediate
in
these
enzymes
has
not
been
identified
,
the
iron
is
likely
to
be
involved
.

Reversible
phosphorylation
of
serine
residues
in
the
regulatory
domains
affects
the
activities
of
all
three
enzymes
.

In
addition
,
phenylalanine
hydroxylase
is
allosterically
regulated
by
its
substrates
,
phenylalanine
and
tetrahydrobiopterin
.

menadione
undergoes
one
-
electron
reduction
to
semiquinone
,
a
reaction
mainly
catalysed
by
mitochondrial
NADH
:
ubiquinone
oxidoreductase
.

It
is
also
converted
to
hydroquinone
by
the
soluble
two
-
electron
reductase
,
DT
-
diaphorase
,
and
is
conjugated
with
GSH
by
glutathione
S
-
transferase
.

In
order
to
assess
the
role
of
DT
-
diaphorase
in
cardiac
responses
to
menadione
,
we
examined
the
effects
of
both
a
specific
inhibitor
(
dicoumarol
)
and
an
inducer
(
beta
-
naphthoflavone
)
of
the
enzyme
on
the
inotropic
action
of
the
quinone
.

In
electrically
driven
left
atria
of
guinea
pig
,
4
microM
dicoumarol
significantly
enhanced
the
positive
inotropic
effect
of
menadione
,
especially
at
the
lower
concentrations
of
the
quinone
.

In
myocardial
preparations
isolated
from
guinea
pigs
treated
with
beta
-
naphthoflavone
(
80
mg
/
kg
i
.
p
.
for
2
days
)
,
DT
-
diaphorase
activity
was
enhanced
(
+
36
%
with
respect
to
control
animals
,
P

.
01
)
,
whereas
the
activities
of
the
other
enzymes
involved
in
menadione
metabolism
were
not
modified
.

In
these
preparations
,
menadione
caused
a
significantly
lower
increase
in
the
force
of
contraction
than
in
atria
from
untreated
animals
;
moreover
,
pretreatment
with
beta
-
naphthoflavone
caused
a
significant
decrease
in
the
menadione
-
induced
oxidative
stress
,
as
evaluated
from
the
GSH
redox
index
.

Taken
together
,
these
results
demonstrate
that
cardiac
DT
-
diaphorase
does
not
contribute
to
ROS
generation
,
but
represents
a
detoxification
system
.

The
use
of
leflunomide
in
the
treatment
of
rheumatoid
arthritis
:
an
experimental
and
clinical
review
.

Leflunomide
,
the
newest
disease
-
modifying
antirheumatic
drug
(
DMARD
)
for
the
treatment
of
rheumatoid
arthritis
(
RA
)
,
acts
by
inhibiting
dihydroorotate
dehydrogenase
,
the
rate
-
limiting
enzyme
in
the
pathway
for
pyrimidine
production
.

The
drug
thus
limits
T
-
cell
proliferation
,
a
process
thought
to
be
a
key
step
in
the
pathogenesis
of
RA
.

In
placebo
-
controlled
trials
,
leflunomide
was
superior
to
placebo
and
comparable
to
sulfasalazine
and
methotrexate
for
improving
the
signs
and
symptoms
of
RA
;
and
superior
to
placebo
,
sulfasalazine
,
and
methotrexate
for
improving
health
-
related
quality
of
life
.

In
the
same
trials
,
leflunomide
was
also
superior
to
methotrexate
and
comparable
to
sulfasalazine
for
slowing
radiographically
assessed
progression
of
RA
.

When
used
in
combination
therapy
in
an
open
-
label
trial
,
leflunomide
resulted
in
improvement
for
over
half
of
a
group
of
RA
patients
who
had
failed
to
respond
to
methotrexate
alone
.

The
most
common
adverse
events
associated
with
leflunomide
treatment
were
gastrointestinal
symptoms
,
allergic
reactions
,
alopecia
,
and
elevated
liver
enzyme
levels
.

Adverse
events
were
generally
mild
to
moderate
in
severity
and
resolved
without
sequelae
.

Clinical
trial
results
indicate
that
leflunomide
is
an
efficacious
and
safe
addition
to
the
roster
of
therapeutic
agents
used
to
treat
RA
.

Mechanisms
of
reduced
body
growth
in
the
pubertal
feminized
male
rat
:
unbalanced
estrogen
and
androgen
action
on
the
somatotropic
axis
.

It
is
well
known
that
the
sex
difference
in
body
growth
at
puberty
is
modulated
by
a
complex
interplay
between
sex
steroids
and
somatotropic
axis
;
however
,
the
exact
role
played
by
sex
steroids
remains
a
matter
of
controversy
.

The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
assess
the
mechanisms
by
which
sex
steroids
regulate
body
growth
during
pubertal
development
.

Flutamide
,
a
non
-
steroid
-
blocking
androgen
receptor
,
was
subcutaneously
administered
to
30
-
d
-
old
male
Wistar
rats
for
4
wk
.

The
blockade
of
the
androgen
receptor
led
to
a
marked
elevation
in
serum
testosterone
and
an
increment
in
serum
estradiol
.

Flutamide
administration
decreased
body
weight
gain
,
serum
IGF
-
I
levels
,
hepatic
IGF
-
I
mRNA
,
and
GH
receptor
mRNA
content
.

There
were
no
significant
changes
in
serum
GH
concentration
,
pituitary
GH
reserve
,
and
pituitary
GH
mRNA
content
.

Flutamide
lowered
hypothalamic
somatostatin
mRNA
content
and
augmented
hypothalamic
immunoreactive
somatostatin
stores
,
but
did
not
alter
hypothalamic
immunoreactive
GH
-
releasing
factor
stores
.

Our
findings
indicate
that
during
pubertal
development
of
the
male
rat
,
the
imbalance
between
androgen
and
estrogen
actions
determines
an
abnormal
somatic
growth
,
which
is
at
least
partly
exerted
through
the
peripheral
or
hepatic
modification
of
the
somatotropic
axis
that
occurs
under
the
high
or
exclusive
action
of
estrogens
.

Potential
implication
of
coincident
sex
-
specific
regulated
mode
of
pulsatile
GH
secretion
cannot
be
excluded
from
this
random
serum
GH
sample

Clinical
pharmacology
,
therapeutic
use
and
potential
of
COMT
inhibitors
in
Parkinson
'
s
disease
.

When
peripheral
decarboxylation
is
blocked
by
carbidopa
or
benserazide
,
the
main
metabolic
pathway
of
levodopa
is
O
-
methylation
by
catechol
-
O
-
methyltransferase
(
COMT
)
.

Entacapone
and
tolcapone
are
new
potent
,
selective
and
reversible
nitrocatechol
-
type
COMT
inhibitors
.

Animal
studies
have
demonstrated
that
entacapone
mainly
has
a
peripheral
effect
whereas
tolcapone
also
inhibits
O
-
methylation
in
the
brain
.

In
human
volunteers
,
both
entacapone
and
tolcapone
dose
-
dependently
inhibit
the
COMT
activity
in
erythrocytes
,
improve
the
bioavailability
and
decrease
the
elimination
of
levodopa
,
and
inhibit
the
formation
of
3
-
O
-
methyldopa
(
3
-
OMD
)
.

Entacapone
is
administered
with
every
scheduled
dose
of
levodopa
whereas
tolcapone
is
administered
3
times
daily
.

The
different
administration
regimens
for
these
agents
are
based
on
their
different
pharmacokinetic
and
pharmacodynamic
profiles
.

Both
entacapone
and
tolcapone
enhance
and
extend
the
therapeutic
effect
of
levodopa
in
patients
with
advanced
and
fluctuating
Parkinson
'
s
disease
.

They
prolong
the
duration
of
levodopa
effect
.

Clinical
studies
show
that
they
increase
the
daily
ON
time
by
an
average
1
to
3
hours
,
improve
the
activities
of
daily
living
and
allow
daily
levodopa
dosage
to
be
decreased
.

Correspondingly
,
they
significantly
reduce
the
daily
OFF
time
.

No
comparative
studies
between
entacapone
and
tolcapone
have
been
performed
.

Tolcapone
also
appears
to
have
a
beneficial
effect
in
patients
with
nonfluctuating
Parkinson
'
s
disease
.

The
main
adverse
effects
of
the
COMT
inhibitors
are
related
to
their
dopaminergic
and
gastrointestinal
effects
.

Enhancement
of
dopaminergic
activity
may
cause
an
initial
worsening
of
levodopa
-
induced
adverse
effects
,
such
as
dyskinesia
,
nausea
,
vomiting
,
orthostatic
hypotension
,
sleep
disorders
and
hallucinations
.

Levodopa
dose
adjustment
is
recommended
to
avoid
these
events
.

Tolcapone
is
associated
with
diarrhoea
in
about
16
to
18
%
of
patients
and
entacapone
in
less
than
10
%
of
patients
.

Diarrhoea
has
led
to
discontinuation
in
5
to
6
%
of
patients
treated
with
tolcapone
and
in
2
.
5
%
of
those
treated
with
entacapone
.

Urine
discoloration
to
dark
yellow
or
orange
is
related
to
the
colour
of
COMT
inhibitors
and
their
metabolites
.

Elevated
liver
transaminase
levels
are
reported
in
1
to
3
%
of
patients
treated
with
tolcapone
but
very
rarely
,
if
at
all
,
in
patients
treated
with
entacapone
.

The
descriptions
of
acute
,
fatal
fulminant
hepatitis
and
potentially
fatal
neurological
reactions
,
such
as
neuroleptic
malignant
syndrome
and
rhabdomyolysis
,
in
association
with
tolcapone
led
to
the
suspension
of
its
marketing
authorisation
in
the
European
Community
and
Canada
.

In
many
other
countries
,
the
use
of
tolcapone
is
restricted
to
patients
who
are
not
responding
satisfactorily
to
other
therapies
.

Regular
monitoring
of
liver
enzymes
is
required
if
tolcapone
is
used
.

No
such
adverse
reactions
have
so
far
been
described
for
entacapone
and
no
laboratory
monitoring
has
been
proposed
.

COMT
inhibitors
added
to
levodopa
therapy
are
beneficial
,
particularly
in
patients
with
fluctuating
disease
.

They
may
be
combined
with
other
antiparkinsonian
drugs
,
such
as
dopamine
agonists
,
selegiline
and
anticholinergics
without
adverse
interactions
.

They
provide
a
new
treatment
possibility
in
patients
with
Parkinson
'
s
disease
who
have
problems
with
their
present
levodopa
therapy

The
secretagogue
5
-
hydroxytryptamine
(
5

)
is
implicated
in
the
pathophysiology
of
cholera
.

5
-
HT
released
from
enterochromaffin
cells
after
cholera
toxin
exposure
is
thought
to
activate
non

neuronally

)
and
neuronally
(
5

)
mediated
water
and
electrolyte
secretion
.

CT
-
secretion
can
be
reduced
by
preventing
the
release
of
5
-
HT
.

Enterochromaffin
cells
possess
numerous
receptors
that
,
under
basal
conditions
,
modulate
5

HT
release
.

2
.

These
include
basolateral
5

HT
(

)
receptors
,
the
activation
of
which
is
known
to
enhance
5

HT
release
.

.

Until
now
,
5
-
HT
(
3
)
receptor
antagonists
(
e

g

granisetron
)
have
been
thought
to
inhibit
cholera
toxin
-
induced
fluid
secretion
by
blockading
5
-
HT
(
3
)
receptors
on
secretory
enteric
neurones
.

Instead
we
postulated
that
they
act
by
inhibiting

determined
by

.

Intraluminal
5

HT
release
was
proportional
to
the
reduction
in
tissue
5
-
HT
levels
and
to
the
onset
of
water
and
electrolyte
secretion
,
suggesting
that
luminal
5
-
HT
levels
reflect
enterochromaffin
cell
activity
.

6
.

Both
lidocaine
and
granisetron
inhibited
fluid
secretion
.

However
,
granisetron
alone
,
and
proportionately
,
reduced
5

HT
release
.

7
.

The
simultaneous
inhibition
of
5
-
HT
release
and
fluid
secretion
by
granisetron
suggests
that
5
-
HT
release
from
enterochromaffin
cells
is
potentiated
by
endogenous
5

receptors
.

The

The
effect
of
a

treatment
with
the

HT
and
NE
reuptake
blocker
venlafaxine
(

was
assessed
on
the
time
required
for

recovery
(
RT
(

)
of
the
firing

(

pyramidal
neurons
from
the
suppression
induced
by
microiontophoretic
applications
of
5
-
HT
and
NE
.

The
RT
(
50
)
values
for
5
-
HT
were
increased
by
both
10
and
40
mg
/
kg

day
regimens
of
venlafaxine
,
whereas
those
for
NE
were
increased
only
by
the
40
mg
/
kg
/
day
regimen
,
indicative
of
a
greater
potency
of
venlafaxine
in
blocking
5
-
HT
reuptake
.

The
sensitivity
of
the
postsynaptic
5
-
HT
(
1A
)
and
alpha
(
2
)
-
adrenergic
receptors
was
altered
by
neither
regimen
of
venlafaxine
.

Using
a
paradigm
by
which
the
5

(
1A
)
antagonist
WAY
100635
can
induce
a
disinhibition
of
firing
activity
of
CA
(
3
)
pyramidal
neurons
,
it
was
demonstrated
that
the
high
,
but
not
the
low
,
dose
of
venlafaxine
led
to
an
enhanced
tonic
activation
of
postsynaptic
5
-
HT
(
1A
)
receptors
in
the
dorsal
hippocampus
.

The
duration
of
the
suppressant
effect
of
the
firing
activity
of
CA
(
3
)
hippocampus
pyramidal
neurons
produced
by
the
electrical
stimulation
of
the
ascending
5
-
HT
pathway
was
significantly
reduced
when
the
frequency
of
the
stimulation
was
enhanced
from
1
Hz
to
5
Hz
in
control
rats
and
in
rats
treated
with
10
mg
/
kg
/
day
,
but
not
with
40
mg
/
kg
/
day
of
venlafaxine
.

Hence
,
venlafaxine
induced
a
desensitization
of
the
terminal
5
-
HT
(
1B
)
autoreceptor
only
at
the
high
dose
.

A
2
-
day
treatment
with
10
mg
/
kg
/
day
of
venlafaxine
induced
a
suppression
of
the
firing
activity
of
5
-
HT
neurons
of
the
dorsal
raphe
.

The
firing
activity
of
these
neurons
was
back
to
control
level
in
rats
that
had
been
treated
for
21
days
with
the

dose
of
venlafaxine
.

The

administration
of
the
5
-
HT
autoreceptor
agonist
LSD
on
the
firing
activity
of
dorsal
raphe
5

was
reduced
in
rats
that
had
been
treated
for
21
days
with
10
mg

/
day
of
venlafaxine

A
2
-
day
treatment
with
40
mg
/
kg
/
day
of
venlafaxine
,
unlike
the
10
mg
/
kg
/
day
regimen
,
induced
a
marked
suppression
of
the
firing
activity
of
locus
coeruleus
NE
neurons
.

However
,
in
contrast
to
5
-
HT
neurons
,
NE
neurons
did
not
recover
their
firing
activity
after
a
21
-
day
treatment
.

Taken
together
,
the
results
from
this
study
indicate
that
the
low
dose
of
venlafaxine
blocked
selectively
the
reuptake
of
5
-
HT
,
whereas
the
high
dose
blocked
the
reuptake
of
both
5
-
HT
and
NE
.

Moreover
,
an
enhancement
of
serotonergic
neurotransmission
by
venlafaxine
was
only
achieved
under
conditions
whereby
the
desensitization
of
the
terminal
5
-
HT
(

autoreceptor
is
appended
to
that
of
the
somatodendritic

Phosphoacetylcholinesterase
:
toxicity
of
phosphorus
oxychloride
to
mammals
and
insects
that
can
be
attributed
to
selective
phosphorylation
of
acetylcholinesterase
by
phosphorodichloridic
acid
.

Phosphorus
oxychloride
(
POCl
(
3
)
)
is
an
intermediate
in
the
synthesis
of
many
organophosphorus
insecticides
and
chemical
warfare
nerve
gases
that
are
toxic
to
insects
and
mammals
by
inhibition
of
acetylcholinesterase
(
AChE
)
activity
.

It
was
therefore
surprising
to
observe
that
POCl
(
3
)
,
which
is
hydrolytically
unstable
,
also
itself
gives
poisoning
signs
in
ip
-
treated
mice
and
fumigant
-
exposed
houseflies
similar
to
those
produced
by
the
organophosphorus
ester
insecticides
and
chemical
warfare
agents
.

In
mice
,
POCl
(

inhibits
serum
butyrylcholinesterase
(
BuChE
)
at
a
sublethal
dose
and
muscle

at
a
lethal

In
houseflies
,
POCl
(

brain
AChE
inhibition
is
correlated
with
poisoning
and
the
probable
cause
thereof
.

The

In

Concluding
,
the

PARTICIPANTS
:
506

from
5661
men
aged
40

59
years
who
provided

.

MAIN
OUTCOME
MEASURES
:
Plasma

,
and
serum

.

Information
on
fatal

was
obtained
from
medical
records
and
death
certificates
.

RESULTS
:
Compared
with
men
in
the
bottom
third
of
baseline
measurements
of
C
reactive

,
men
in
the
top
third
had
an

after

,
although
the
association
between
low

was
weaker
(

.

CONCLUSION
:
In
the
context
of
results
from
other
relevant
studies
these
findings
suggest
that
some
inflammatory
processes
,
unrelated
to
the
chronic

,
are
likely
to
be
involved
in

Cytosolic

was
identical
to
that
of
the

Complementary
DNAs
for

were
cloned
,
and

were
expressed
as
homodimers
in
Escherichia

.

The
recombinant
GSTM2

catalyzed
the
conversion

respectively
,
at
the
optimal
pH
of

,
whereas
GSTM4
-
4
was
inactive
;
although
all
three
enzymes
showed
GST
activity
.

The
PGE
synthase
activity
depended
on
thiols
,
such
as
glutathione
,
dithiothreitol
,
2

mercaptoethanol
,
or

Evaluation

in

UNLABELLED
:
Apparent

(
mAch
)
receptor
occupancy
in
mouse
cerebral
cortex
,
hippocampus
,
and
striatum
by
scopolamine
,
an
antagonist
,
and
biperiden
,
a
relatively
selective
M1
antagonist
,
was
estimated
with
competitive
binding
studies
using
two
different
radioligands
:
3H
-
N
-
methyl
piperidyl
benzilate
(
3H
-
NMPB
)
and
3H
-
quinuclidinyl
benzilate
(
3H
-
QNB
)
.

Both
radioligands
labeled
mAch
receptors
in
these
brain
regions
,
and
the
relative
regional
distributions
of
the
specific
binding
of
3H
-
NMPB
in
vivo
paralleled
the
distribution
of
mAch
receptors
.

3H
-
NMPB
binding
in
vivo
was
much
more
sensitive
to
direct
competitive
inhibition
by
scopolamine
than
was
3H
-
QNB
.

A
similar
discrepancy
in
sensitivity
to
competitors
between
3H
-
NMPB
and
3H
-
QNB
was
also
observed
when
biperiden
was
used
as
a
competitor
,
indicating
that
binding
to
different
subtypes
of
the
mAch
receptor
could
not
account
for
the
observed
differences
in
sensitivity
to
competition
.

An
in
vivo
saturation
study
suggested
that
the
apparent
association
rate
constant
(
k
on
)
of
3H
-
QNB
binding
might
be
changed
by
ligand
concentration
.

The
heterogeneity
of
the
free
ligand
concentration
in
intact
brain
was
assessed
in
relation
to
the
ligand
concentration
dependency
of
the
apparent
association
rate
constant
(
k
on
)
of
3H
-
QNB
binding
.

This
finding
,
together
with
the
more
favorable
accumulation
of
3H
-
NMPB
in
cerebral
cortex
,
hippocampus
,
and
striatum
,
leads
us
to
conclude
that
3H
-
NMPB
,
or
its
positron
emitting
counterpart
,
should
be
the
more
favorable
radiotracer
for
the
estimation
of
mAch
receptor
occupancy
by
cholinergic
drugs
in
the
brain
.

Modulation
of
KCNQ2
/
3
potassium
channels
by
the
novel
anticonvulsant
retigabine
.

Retigabine
is
a
novel
anticonvulsant
with
an
unknown
mechanism
of
action
.

It
has
recently
been
reported
that
retigabine
modulates
a
potassium
channel
current
in
nerve
growth
factor
-
differentiated
PC12
cells
(
)
,
however
,
to
date
the
molecular
correlate
of
this
current
has
not
been
identified
.

In
the
present
study
we
have
examined
the
effects
of
retigabine
on
recombinant
human
KCNQ2
and
KCNQ3
potassium
channels
,
expressed
either
alone
or
in
combination
in
Xenopus
oocytes
.

Application
of
10
microM
retigabine
to
oocytes
expressing
the
KCNQ2
/
3
heteromeric
channel
shifted
both
the
activation
threshold
and
voltage
for
half
-
activation
by
approximately
20
mV
in
the
hyperpolarizing
direction
,
leading
to
an
increase
in
current
amplitude
at
test
potentials
between
-
80
mV
and
+
20
mV
.

Retigabine
also
had
a
marked
effect
on
KCNQ
current
kinetics
,
increasing
the
rate
of
channel
activation
but
slowing
deactivation
at
a
given
test
potential
.

Similar
effects
of
retigabine
were
observed
in
oocytes
expressing
KCNQ2
alone
,
suggesting
that
KCNQ2
may
be
the
molecular
target
of
retigabine
.

Membrane
potential
recordings
in
oocytes
expressing
the
KCNQ2
/
3
heteromeric
channel
showed
that
application
of
retigabine
leads
to
a
concentration
-
dependent
hyperpolarization
of
the
oocyte
,
from
a
resting
potential
of
-
63
mV
under
control
conditions
to
-
85
mV
in
the
presence
of
100
microM
retigabine
(
IC
(
50
)
=
5
.
2
microM
)
.

In
control
experiments
retigabine
had
no
effect
on
either
resting
membrane
potential
or
endogenous
oocyte
membrane
currents
.

In
conclusion
,
we
have
shown
that
retigabine
acts
as
a
KCNQ
potassium
channel
opener
.

Because
the
heteromeric
KCNQ2
/
3
channel
has
recently
been
reported
to
underlie
the
M
-
current
,
it
is
likely
that
M
-
current
modulation
can
explain
the
anticonvulsant
actions
of
retigabine
in
animal
models
of
epilepsy
.

Impaired

-
induced

.

The
expression
of
uncoupling
protein
(
UCP
)
-
3
mRNA
in
skeletal
muscle
is
dramatically
reduced
during
lactation
in
mice
.

The
reduction
in
UCP
-
3
mRNA
levels
lowers
the
amount
of
the
UCP
-
3
protein
in
skeletal
muscle
mitochondria
during
lactation
.

Spontaneous
or
abrupt
weaning
reverses
the
downregulation
of
the
UCP
-
3
mRNA
but
not
the
reduction
in
UCP
-
3
protein
levels
.

In
lactating
and
virgin
mice
,
however
,
fasting
increases
UCP
-
3
mRNA
levels
.

Changes
in
UCP
-
3
mRNA
occur
in
parallel
with
modifications
in
the
levels
of
free
fatty
acids
,
which
are
reduced
in
lactation
and
are
upregulated
due
to
weaning
or
fasting
.

Modifications
in
the
energy

stress
of
lactating
dams
achieved
by
manipulating
litter
sizes
do
not
influence
UCP
-
3
mRNA
levels
in
skeletal
muscle
.

Conversely
,
when
mice
are
fed
a
high
-
fat
diet
after
parturition
,
the
downregulation
of
UCP
-
3

due

is
partially
reversed
,

is
the

.

of

3
mRNA
expression
,
whereas
troglitazone
is
at
least
as
effective
as
it
is
in
lactating
dams
.

It
is
proposed
that
the
UCP
-
3
gene
is
regulated
in
skeletal
muscle
during
lactation
in
response
to
changes
in
circulating
free
fatty
acids
by
mechanisms
involving
activation
of
PPARs
.

The
impaired
expression
of
the
UCP
-
3
gene
is
consistent
with
the
involvement
of
UCP
-
3
gene
regulation
in
the
reduction
of
the
use
of
fatty
acids
as
fuel
by
the
skeletal
muscle
and
in
impaired
adaptative
thermogenesis
,
both
of
which
are
major
metabolic
adaptations
that
occur
during
lactation
.

Hypertrophic
effect
of
selective
beta
(
1
)
-
adrenoceptor
stimulation
on
ventricular
cardiomyocytes
from
adult
rat
.

We
investigated
whether
selective
beta
(
1
)
-
adrenoceptor
stimulation
causes
hypertrophic
growth
on
isolated
ventricular
cardiomyocytes
from
adult
rat
.

As
parameters
for
the
induction
of
hypertrophic
growth
,
the
increases
of
[
(
14
)
C
]
phenylalanine
incorporation
,
protein
and
RNA
mass
,
and
cell
size
were
determined
.

Isoproterenol
(
Iso
,
10
microM
)
alone
had
no
growth
effect
.

In
the
presence
of
the
beta
(
2
)
-
adrenoceptor
antagonist
ICI
-
118551
(
ICI
,
10
microM
)
,
Iso
caused
an
increase
in
[
(
14
)
C
]
phenylalanine
incorporation
,
protein
and
RNA
mass
,
cell
volume
,
and
cross
-
sectional
area
.

We
showed
for
phenylalanine
incorporation
that
the
growth
effect
of
Iso
+
ICI
could
be
antagonized
by
beta
(
1
)
-
adrenoceptor
blockade
with
atenolol
(
10
microM
)
or
metoprolol
(
10
microM
)
,
indicating
that
it
was
caused
by
selective
beta
(
1
)
-
adrenoceptor
stimulation
.

The
growth
response
to
Iso
+
ICI
was
accompanied
by
an
increase
in
ornithine
decarboxylase
(
ODC
)
activity
and
expression
.

Inhibition
of
ODC
by
the
ODC
antagonist
difluoromethylornithine
(
1
mM
)
attenuated
this
hypertrophic
response
,
indicating
that
ODC
induction
is
causally
involved
.

The
growth
response
to
Iso
+
ICI
was
found
to
be
cAMP
independent
but
was
sensitive
to
genistein
(
100
microM
)
or
rapamycin
(
0
.
1
microM
)
.

The
reaction
was
enhanced
in
the
presence
of
pertussis
toxin
(
10
microM
)
.

We
conclude
that
selective
beta
(
1
)
-
adrenoceptor
stimulation
causes
hypertrophic
growth
of
ventricular
cardiomyocytes
by
a
mechanism
that
is
independent
of
cAMP
but
dependent
on
a
tyrosine
kinase
and
ODC
.

Hyperphenylalaninemia

/
DCoH
:
analysis
of
enzyme
activity
in
intestinal
biopsies
.

Hyperphenylalaninemia
,
which
can
cause
neurological
disorders
and
mental
retardation
,
results
from
a
mutation
in
phenylalanine
hydroxylase
or
an
enzyme
required
for
biosynthesis
or
regeneration
of
its
cofactor
,
tetrahydrobiopterin
.

The
hyperphenylalaninemia
variant
primapterinuria
is
characterized
by
the
excretion
of
7
-
biopterin
(
primapterin
)
.

This
disorder
is
thought
to
be
due
to
a
deficiency
of
4a
-
hydroxy
-
tetrahydrobiopterin
dehydratase
(
pterin
-
4a
-
carbinolamine
dehydratase
)
,
but
a
lack
of
tissue
activity
has
not
been
directly
demonstrated
.

The
five
mutations
so
far
recognized
in
patients
with
primapterinuria
are
associated
with
either
a
single
amino
acid
change
or
a
premature
stop
codon
.

Only
C81R
has
been
successfully
expressed
in
soluble
form
,
and
was
found
to
have
40
%
of
normal
activity
.

Tissues
which
could
be
obtained
by
minimally
invasive
procedures
were
analyzed
for
dehydratase
activity
.

None
was
detected
in
normal
human
white
cells
or
fibroblasts
.

However
,
activity
was
found
in
intestine
of
rat
,
dog
,
pig
,
and
particularly
humans
where
it
was
only
eight
times
lower
than
in
liver
.

Distribution
along
the
length
and
across
the
wall
of
small
intestine
was
relatively
uniform
.

Moreover
,
the
dehydratases
from
human
liver
and
intestinal
mucosa
have
identical
kinetic
properties
.

A
biopsy
of
duodenal
mucosa
from
a
patient
with
homozygous
E96K
dehydratase
had
activity
of
55
nmol
.

min

)
mucosa
compared
to
329

.

min
(
-
1
)
g
(
-
1
)
tissue
in
controls
(
n
=
12
)
.

The
sixfold
lower
tissue
activity
of
the
E96K
mutant
alone
may
not
be
sufficient
to
account
for
the
biochemical
symptoms
of
primapterinuria
in
this
patient
.

However
,
accumulation
of
a
4a
-
hydroxy
-
tetrahydrobiopterin
degradation
product
(
a
side
-
chain
cyclic
adduct
)
,
which
has
been
observed
in
vitro
and
appears
to
be
a
dehydratase
inhibitor
,
may
further
exacerbate
the
problem
.

Effects
of
the

of
cyclo

on
the
activation
of
the
hypothalamic

-
adrenal
axis
induced
by
interleukin

1beta
in
the
male
Rat
.

The
limited
entry
of
interleukin
-
1beta
(
IL
-
1beta
)
into
the
central
nervous
system
has
led
to
the
hypothesis
that
IL
-
1beta
acts
,
through
IL
-
1beta
receptors
located
notably
on
endothelial
cells
,
on
the
release
of
prostaglandins
which
in
turn
stimulate
the
hypothalamic
-
pituitary
-
adrenal
(
HPA
)
axis
.

We
used
cyclo
-
oxygenase
-
1
(
COX
-

)
and
cyclo
-
oxygenase
-
2
(
COX

)
and
5
-
lipoxygenase
(
5
-
LOX
)
inhibitors
,
before
the
injection
of
IL
-
1beta
,
to
explore
the
role
of
arachidonic
acid
metabolic
pathways
on
HPA
axis
activation
.

Adult
male
rats
were
i

m
injected
20
min
before

of

,
with
(

:
a

(

)
;
(

(

;
or
(

)
a
5

inhibitor
(

)
.

Following
this
,
rats
were
killed
90
min
after

.

IL
-
1beta
injection
and
analysis
for
plasma
adrenocorticotropic
hormone
(
ACTH
)
and
corticosterone
concentrations
and
determination
of
anterior
pituitary
pro
-
opio
melanocortin
(
POMC
)
gene
transcription
was
conducted
.

Administration
of
the
COX
-
1
/
COX
-
2
inhibitor
led
to
a
complete
blockage
of
ACTH
and
corticosterone
secretion
and
POMC
gene
transcription
.

The
COX
-
2
inhibitor
led
to
a
complete
blockade
of
ACTH
secretion
and
POMC
gene
transcription
but
had
no
effect
on
corticosterone
secretion
.

The
5
-
LOX
inhibitor
had
no
significant
effect
on
any
parameter
.

These
results
demonstrate
the
crucial
role
of
eicosanoid
pathways
in
mediating
the
stimulation
of
the
HPA
axis
induced
by
IL
-
1beta
.

Moreover
,
we
found
a
clear
dissociation
of
the
effect
of
the
blockage
of
COXs
upon
ACTH
and
corticosterone
secretion
,
suggesting
that
IL
-
1beta
may
act
at
the
brain
as
well
as
at
the
adrenal
cortex
to
stimulate
the
secretion
of
corticosterone
.

Drug
treatment
of
obesity
.

Drugs
to
treat
obesity
can
be
divided
into
three
groups
:
those
which
reduce
food
intake
,
those
which
alter
metabolism
and
those
which
increase
thermogenesis
.

Monoamines
acting
on
noradrenergic
receptors
,
serotonin
receptors
,
dopamine
receptors
and
histamine
receptors
can
reduce
food
intake
.

A
number
of
peptides
also
affect
food
intake
.

The
noradrenergic
drugs
phentermine
,
diethylpropion
,
mazindol
benzphetamine
and
phendimetrazine
are
approved
only
for
short
-
term
use
.

Sibutramine
,
a
norepinephrine
-
serotonin
re
-
uptake
inhibitor
,
is
approved
for
long
-
term
use
.

Orlistat
inhibits
pancreatic
lipase
and
can
block
30
%
of
triglyceride
hydrolysis
in
subjects
eating
a
30
%
fat
diet
.

The
only
thermogenic
drug
combination
that
has
been
tested
is
ephedrine
and
caffeine
,
but
this
treatment
has
not
been
approved
by
regulating
agencies
.

Leptin
is
currently
in
clinical
trials

other
drugs
that
may

are
being
developed

The
apoptosome
:
heart
and
soul
of
the
cell
death
machine
.

Apoptosis
is
a
fundamental
biologic
process
by
which
metazoan
cells
orchestrate
their
own
self
-
demise
.

Genetic
analyses
of
the
nematode
C
elegans
identified
three
core
components
of
the
suicide
apparatus
which
include
CED
-
3
,
CED
-
4
,
and
CED
-
9
.

An
analogous
set
of
core
constituents
exists
in
mammalian
cells
and
includes
caspase
-
9
,
Apaf
-
1
,
and
bcl
-
2
/
xL
,
respectively
.

CED
-
3
and
CED
-
4
,
along
with
their
mammalian
counterparts
,
function
to
kill
cells
,
whereas
CED
-
9
and
its
mammalian
equivalents
protect
cells
from
death
.

These
central
components
biochemically
intermingle
in
a
ternary
complex
recently
dubbed
the
"
apoptosome
.
"
The
C
elegans
protein
EGL
-
1
and
its
mammalian
counterparts
,
pro
-
apoptotic
members
of
the
bcl
-
2
family
,
induce
cell
death
by
disrupting
apoptosome
interactions
.

Thus
,
EGL
-
1
may
represent
a
primordial
signal
integrator
for
the
apoptosome
.

Various
biochemical
processes
including
oligomerization
,
adenosine
triphosphate
ATP
/
dATP
binding
,
and
cytochrome
c
interaction
play
a
role
in
regulating
the
ternary
death
complex
.

Recent
studies
suggest
that
cell
death
receptors
,
such
as
CD95
,
may
amplify
their
suicide
signal
by
activating
the
apoptosome
.

These
mutual
associations
by
core
components
of
the
suicide
apparatus
provide
a
molecular
framework
in
which
diverse
death
signals
likely
interface
.

Understanding
the
apoptosome
and
its
cellular
connections
will
facilitate
the
design
of
novel
therapeutic
strategies
for
cancer
and
other
disease
states
in
which
apoptosis
plays
a
pivotal
role

the

In

In

retigabine
enhanced

The

Our

Interaction
of
flavodoxin
with

Cobalamin

catalyzes
the

of
a
methyl

,
is
occasionally
inactivated
by
oxidation
of

To
return
to
the
catalytic
cycle
,
the
cob
(
II
)
alamin
forms
of
both
the
bacterial

mammalian
enzymes
must
be
reductively
remethylated
.

Reduced
flavodoxin
donates
an

for
this

In

containing
a
domain
with
a
significant
degree
of
homology
to
flavodoxin
.

Because
of
this
homology
,
studies
of
the
interactions
between
E
.
coli
flavodoxin
and
methionine
synthase
provide
a
model
for
the
mammalian
system
.

To
characterize
the
binding
interface
between
E
.
coli
flavodoxin
and
methionine
synthase
,
we
have
employed
site
-
directed
mutagenesis
and
chemical
cross
-
linking
using
carbodiimide
and
N
-
hydroxysuccinimide
.

Glutamate
61
of
flavodoxin
is
identified
as
a
cross
-
linked
residue
,
and
lysine
959
of
the
C
-
terminal
activation
domain
of
methionine
synthase
is
assigned
as
its
partner
.

The
mutation
of
lysine
959
to
threonine
results
in
a
diminished
level
of
cross
-
linking
,
but
has
only
a
small
effect
on
the
affinity
of
methionine
synthase
for
flavodoxin
.

Identification
of
these
cross
-
linked
residues
provides
evidence
in
support
of
a
docking
model
that
will
be
useful
in
predicting
the
effects
of
mutations
observed
in
mammalian
homologues
of
E
.
coli
flavodoxin
and
methionine
synthase

A

epilepsy
maps
to

(
PDE
)
is
a
rare
autosomal
recessive
disorder
characterized
by
generalized

in
the
first

an
alteration
in
the

has
been
postulated
in

Furthermore
,
no

SELECTION
:
Relevant

were
chosen
to
summarize
the
pharmacokinetics
,

SYNTHESIS
:
Entacapone
is
the
second
medication
of
a
new
class
of
drugs
,
the
catechol
-
O
-
methyltransferase
inhibitors
,
indicated
for
clinical
use
as
an
adjunct
to
levodopa
/
carbidopa
to
treat
patients
with
idiopathic
Parkinson
'
s
disease
who
experience
the
signs
and
symptoms
of
end
-
of
-
dose
wearing
-
off
.

Entacapone
in
combination
with
levodopa
/
dopa
decarboxylase
inhibitor
has
been
shown
to
increase
the
AUC
of
levodopa
,
which
leads
to
less
fluctuation
of
levodopa
plasma
concentrations
.

Clinically
,
the
duration
of
motor
response
to
levodopa
was
prolonged
as
reflected
by
an
increase
in
the
mean
on
time
.

The
addition
of
entacapone
resulted
in
a
decrease
in
the
mean
daily
dosage
of
levodopa
.

The
recommended
dosage
of
entacapone
is
200
mg
administered
orally
with
each
dose
of
levodopa
/
carbidopa
,
up
to
a
maximum
of
eight
doses
per
day
.

Common
adverse
effects
include
dyskinesia
,
nausea
,
diarrhea
,
and
urine
discoloration
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
Entacapone
should
be
considered
as
add
-
on
treatment
to
levodopa
/
carbidopa
in

Bupropion
is
a
nicotinic
antagonist
.

Neuronal
nicotinic
receptors
are
ligand
-
gated
ion
channels
of
the
central
and
peripheral
central
nervous
system
that
regulate
synaptic
activity
from
both
pre
-
and
postsynaptic
sites
.

The
present
study
establishes
the
acute
interaction
of
bupropion
,
an
antidepressant
agent
that
is
also
effective
in
nicotine
dependence
,
with
nicotine
and
nicotinic
receptors
using
different
in
vivo
and
in
vitro
tests
.

Bupropion
was
found
to
block
nicotine
'
s
antinociception
(
in
two
tests
)
,
motor
effects
,
hypothermia
,
and
convulsive
effects
with
different
potencies
in
the
present
investigation
,
suggesting
that
bupropion
possesses
some
selectivity
for
neuronal
nicotinic
receptors
underlying
these
various
nicotinic
effects
.

In
addition
,
bupropion
blocks
nicotine
activation
of
alpha
(
3
)
beta
(
2
)
,
alpha
(
4
)
beta
(
2
)
,
and
alpha
(
7
)
neuronal
acetylcholine
nicotinic
receptors
(
nAChRs
)
with
some
degree
of
selectivity
.

It
was
approximately
50
and
12
times
more
effective
in
blocking
alpha
(
3
)
beta
(
2
)
and
alpha
(
4
)
beta
(
2
)
than
alpha
(
7
.
)
This
functional
blockade
was
noncompetitive
,
because
it
was
insurmountable
by
increasing
concentration
of
ACh
in
the
nAChRs
subtypes
tested
.

Furthermore
,
bupropion
at
high
concentration
failed
to
displace
brain
[
(
3
)
H
]
nicotine
binding
sites
,
a
site
largely
composed
of
alpha
(
4
)
beta
(
2
)
subunit
combination
.

Given
the
observation
that
bupropion
inhibition
of
alpha
(
3
)
beta
(
2
)
and
alpha
(
4
)
beta
(
2
)
receptors
exhibits
voltage
-
independence
properties
,
bupropion
may
not
be
acting
as
an
open
channel
blocker
.

These
effects
may
explain
in
part
bupropion
'
s
efficacy
in
nicotine
dependence
.

Our
present
findings
suggest
that
functional
blockade
of
neuronal
nAChRs
are
useful
in
nicotine
dependence
treatment
.

A

Cloning
and
functional

.

Leukotriene
B
(
4
)
(
LTB
(
4
)
)
is
a
product
of
eicosanoid
metabolism
and
acts
as
an
extremely
potent
chemotactic
mediator
for
inflammation
.

LTB
(
4
)
exerts
positive
effects
on
the
immigration
and
activation
of
leukocytes
.

These
effects
suggest
an
involvement
of
LTB
(
4
)
in
several
diseases
:
inflammatory
bowel
disease
,
psoriasis
,
arthritis
,
and
asthma
.

LTB
(

)
elicits
actions
through
interaction
with
one
or
more
cell
surface
receptors
that
lead
to
chemotaxis
and
inflammation
.

One
leukotriene
B
(
4
)
receptor
has
been
recently
identified
(
LTB
(

-
R1
)
.

In
this
report
we
describe
cloning
of
a
cDNA
encoding
a
novel
358

(
LTB

that
possesses

spanning

and
is
homologous
(
42

)
and
genetically
linked
to
LTB

.

Expression
of
LTB

is
broad
but
highest
in

revealed
high

of
the

but
not
for

.

No
apparent

for
the
receptors
was
detected
for
the

.

LTB
(

)
functionally
mobilized

calcium
and
inhibited

The
discovery
of
this
new
receptor
should
aid
in
further
understanding
the
roles
of
LTB
(

)
in
pathologies
in
these
tissues
and
may
provide
a
tool
in
identification
of
specific
antagonists

for
potential

.

By
using
the
technique
of
site

combined
with
EPR
spectroscopy
,
we
have
observed
that
binding
of
arachidonic

anti

induces
conformational
changes
in
the
human

was
used
to
calculate
the
inter

distances
and
changes
in
these

that
occur
in
response
to
binding

ligands
.

The

determined
for

using

were

A
shorter
than
those
of
the
crystal

of
the

.

However
,
inter

calculated
and
determined
by
EPR
for
PGHS
-
2
complexed
with
arachidonic
acid
,

,
and
SC

were
in
close
agreement
with
those
obtained
from
the
cognate

structures
.

These
results
indicate
that
the
structure
of
the
solubilized
PGHS

holoenzyme
measured
in
solution
differs
from
the
crystal
structure
of
PGHS
-
2
holoenzyme
obtained
by
x
-
ray
analysis
.

Furthermore
,
binding
of
ligands
induces
a
conformational
change
in
the
holo
-
PGHS
-
2
,
converting
it
to
a
structure
similar
to
those
obtained
by
x

ray
analysis
.

Proteolysis
protection
assays
had
previously
provided
circumstantial
evidence
that
binding
of
heme
and
non
-
steroidal
anti
-
inflammatory
drugs
alters
the
conformation
of
PGHS
,
but
the
present
experiments
are
the
first
to
directly
measure
such
changes
.

The
finding
that
arachidonate
can
also
induce
a
conformational
change
in
PGHS
-
2
was
unexpected
,
and
the
magnitude
of
changes
suggests
this
structural
flexibility
may
be
integral
to
the
cyclooxygenase
catalytic
mechanism
.

BACKGROUND
:
Non
-
steroidal
anti
-
inflammatory
drugs
(
NSAIDs
)
are
known
to
be
potentially
nephrotoxic
agents
.

NSAIDs
inhibit
the
enzyme
cyclo
-
oxygenase
and
thereby
block
the
prostaglandin
synthesis
in
the
kidneys
.

Cyclo
-
oxygenase
exists
in
two
isoforms
(
COX
-
1
and
COX
-
2
)
.

It
has
been
proposed
that
NSAIDs
with
preferential
COX
-
2
selectivity
have
fewer
renal
side
effects
than
drugs
with
preferential
COX
-
1
selectivity
.

Etodolac
is
a
relative
selective
inhibitor
of
COX
-
2
,
while
ibuprofen
has
a
higher
potency
against

OBJECTIVE
:
In
this
study
,
we
compared
the
effects
of
etodolac
and
ibuprofen
on
renal
function
,
plasma
renin
,
plasma
arginine
vasopressin
and
the
urinary
excretion
of
albumin
and
alpha
-
glutathione
-
S
-
transferase
(
alpha
-
GST
)
.

METHODS
:
In
a
randomised
,
double
-
blind
,
three
-
way
crossover
study
with
placebo
,
we
compared
the
effects
of
2
weeks
of
treatment
with
ibuprofen
and
etodolac
on
renal
haemodynamics
[
glomerular
filtration
rate
(
GFR
)
,
renal
plasma
flow
(
RPF
)
and
filtration
fraction
(
FF
)
]
,
tubular
function
and
plasma
concentrations
of
the
hormones
renin
(
PRC
)
and
arginine
vasopressin
(
AVP
)
in
18
healthy
subjects
.

In
addition
,
we
examined
the
effects
on
the
urinary
excretion
of
albumin
and
alpha
-
GST
as
markers
of
renal
injury
.

RESULTS
:
No
differences
were
found
between
the
three
treatments
,
placebo
,
ibuprofen
and
etodolac
,
in
the
effects
on
GFR
,
RPF
,
FF
,
free
water
clearance
,
urinary
output
or
fractional
excretion
of
potassium
and
sodium
.

However
,
ibuprofen
,
in
contrast
to
etodolac
,
caused
a
significant
decrease
in
both
lithium
clearance
(
-
16
%
versus
placebo
)
and
the
fractional
excretion
of
lithium
(
-
17
%
versus
placebo
)
,
suggesting
an
increase
in
the
reabsorption
in
the
proximal
tubuli
.

PRC
was
reduced
significantly
by
ibuprofen
(
-
32
%
versus
placebo
)
but
not
etodolac
.

None
of
the
drugs
changed
AVP
.

Fourteen
days
of
treatment
with
ibuprofen
caused
a
significant
decrease
(
-
47
%
versus
placebo
)
in
the
urinary
excretion
of
alpha
-
GST
,
while
no
changes
were
seen
after
etodolac
.

None
of
the
drugs
changed
the
urinary
excretion
of
albumin
.

CONCLUSION
:
In
conclusion
,
a
14
-
day
administration
of
etodolac
or
ibuprofen
in
therapeutic
doses
did
not
affect
the
renal
haemodynamics
,
the
net
excretion
of
electrolytes
or
the
urinary
excretion
of
albumin
in
healthy
subjects
.

However
,
ibuprofen
,
in
contrast
to
etodolac
,
caused
a
reduction
in
PRC
,
suggesting
that
COX
-
1
is
involved
in
basal
renin
release
in
humans
.

Furthermore
,
ibuprofen
decreased
lithium
excretion
suggesting
that
COX
-
1
is
involved
in
the
re
-
absorption
of
sodium
and
/
or
water
in
the
proximal
tubuli
.

The
reduction
in
the
urinary
excretion
of
alpha
-
GST
by
ibuprofen
may
be
caused
by
an
inhibition
of
the
detoxification
enzyme
by
ibuprofen
.

Overall
the
study
indicates
that
only
small
differences
in
the
effects
of
the
two
drugs
on
renal
function
in
healthy
subjects
exist
during
a
treatment
period
of
2
weeks
.

The
active

site
residue
tyr
-
175
in
human
glyoxalase
II
contributes
to
binding
of
glutathione
derivatives
.

Tyrosine
-
175
located
in
the
active
site
of
human
glyoxalase
II
was
replaced
by
phenylalanine
in
order
to
study
the
contribution
of
this
residue
to
catalysis
.

The
mutation
had
a
marginal
effect
on
the
k
(
cat
)
value
determined
using
S
-
D
-
lactoylglutathione
as
substrate
.

However
,
the
Y175F
mutant
had
an
8
-
fold
higher
K
(
m
)
value
than
the
wild
-
type
enzyme
.

The
competitive
inhibitor
S
-
(
N
-
hydroxy
-
N
-
bromophenylcarbamoyl
)
glutathione
had
a
30
-
fold
higher
K
(
i
)
value
towards
the
mutant
,
than
that
of
the
wild
-
type
.

Pre
-
equilibrium
fluorescence
studies
with
the
inhibitor
showed
that
this
was
due
to
a
significantly
increased
off
-
rate
for
the
mutant
enzyme
.

The
phenolic
hydroxyl
group
of
tyrosine
-
175
is
within
hydrogen
bonding
distance
of
the
amide
nitrogen
of
the
glycine
in
the
glutathione
moiety
and
the
present
study
shows
that
this
interaction
makes
a
significant
contribution
to
the
binding
of
the
active
-
site
ligand
.

Beneficial
renal
and
hemodynamic
effects
of
omapatrilat
in
mild
and
severe
heart
failure
.

Omapatrilat
is
a
member
of
the
new
drug
class
of
vasopeptidase
inhibitors
that
may
offer
benefit
in
the
treatment
of
heart
failure
(
HF
)
through
simultaneous
inhibition
of
angiotensin
-
converting
enzyme
and
neutral
endopeptidase
.

We
examined
the
effects
of
omapatrilat
in
a
placebo
-
controlled
crossover
study
using
a
pacing
model
of
HF
.

Seven
sheep
were
paced
sequentially
at
180
bpm
(
mild
HF
)
and
then
225
bpm
(
severe
HF
)
for
7
days
each
.

Omapatrilat
(

)
or
vehicle
was
administered
by
intravenous
bolus
on
days
4
to
7
of
each
paced
period
.

Omapatrilat
lowered
mean
arterial
and
left
atrial
pressure
and
increased
cardiac
output
acutely
and
chronically
in
both
mild
and
severe
HF
(
P
<

.
01
for
all
)
.

Plasma
atrial
and
brain
natriuretic
peptide
and
cGMP
levels
were
stable
acutely
(
P
=
NS
)
,
while
brain
natriuretic
peptide
increased
after
repeated
dosing
in
severe
HF
(
P
<
0
.
05
)
.

Plasma
renin
activity
rose
,
whereas
angiotensin
II
and
aldosterone
levels
fell
after
acute
and
repeated
dosing
in
both
states
(
P
<
0
.
01
for
all
)
.

Omapatrilat
increased
urinary
sodium
excretion
by
day
7
in
both
mild
and
severe
HF
(
P
<
0
.
05
)
.

Effective
renal
plasma
flow
and
glomerular
filtration
rate
increased
or
were
stable
after
omapatrilat
in
mild
and
severe
HF
after
both
acute
and
repeated
dosing
.

Omapatrilat
exhibited
pronounced
acute
and
sustained
beneficial
hemodynamic
and
renal
effects
in
both
mild
and
severe

We
compared
the
effects
of
eletriptan

on
the
human

,
but
the
middle

relaxed
following
the
highest

(

of

.

In
the

These
results
suggest
that
(
i
)
based
on
the
differences
in
pEC
(
50

values
,
the
cranioselectivity
of
eletriptan
(

)
is
higher
than
that
of
sumatriptan
(

)
in

,
(
ii
)
the
contractile
effects
of
sumatriptan
and
eletriptan
(
lower
concentrations
)
in
the
three
blood
vessels
are
mediated
via
the
5

HT
(

receptor
,
and
(
iii
)
additional
mechanisms
seem
to
be
involved
in
coronary

contractions
and
middle

A
comparison
of
agonist
-
specific
coupling
of
cloned
human
alpha
(
2
)

adrenoceptor
subtypes
.

The
agonist
-
specific
coupling
properties
of
the
three
cloned
human
alpha
(
2
)
-
adrenoceptor
subtypes
have
been
compared
,
when
expressed
at
similar
levels
in
Chinese
hamster
ovary
(
CHO
)
cell
lines
,
using
noradrenaline
and
(
+
/
-
)
-
meta
-
octopamine
as
agonists
.

Noradrenaline
can
couple
the
receptor
to
both
the
inhibition
and
stimulation
of
forskolin
-
stimulated
cyclic
AMP
production
in
all
three
receptor
subtypes
,
with
the
relative
strength
of
the
coupling
to
the
pathways
varying
for
each
of
the
receptor
subtypes
.

meta
-
Octopamine
selectively
couples
the
alpha
(
2A
)
-
adrenoceptor
only
to
the
inhibition
of
forskolin
-
stimulated
cyclic
AMP
production
.

However
,
meta
-
octopamine
couples
the
alpha
(
2B
)
-
and
alpha
(
2C
)
-
adrenoceptors
to
both
the
inhibition
and
stimulation
of
forskolin
-
stimulated
cyclic
AMP
production
.

The
relative
potency
of
meta
-
octopamine
to
noradrenaline
varies
between
the
different
alpha
(
2
)
-
adrenoceptor
subtypes
.

The
effects
of
meta
-
octopamine
are
around
two
orders
of
magnitude
less
potent
than
those
of
noradrenaline
on
both
the
alpha
(
2A
)
-
and
alpha
(
2B
)
-
adrenoceptor
subtypes
.

In
contrast
,
in
the
case
of
the
alpha
(
2C
)
-
adrenoceptor
,
meta
-
octopamine
is
only
one
order
of
magnitude
less
potent
than
noradrenaline
in
the
stimulation
of
forskolin
-
stimulated
cyclic
AMP
production
and
,
in
addition
,
is
equipotent
with
noradrenaline
in
the
inhibition
of
forskolin
-
stimulated
cyclic
AMP
production
and
has
an
increased
maximal
response
.

This
raises
the
possibility
that
meta
-
octopamine
may
have
physiologically
important
actions
via
alpha
(
2C
)
-
adrenoceptors
in
vivo
.

The
results
show
that
the
modulation
of
cyclic
AMP
production
occurs
in
both
a
subtype
-
and
agonist
-
specific
manner
for
alpha
(
2A
)
-
adrenoceptors
and
in
a
subtype
specific
manner
for
alpha
(
2B
)
-
and
alpha
(
2C
)

adrenoceptors
.

Suppression
of
NF

kappaB
activity
by
sulfasalazine
is
mediated
by
direct
inhibition
of
IkappaB
kinases
alpha
and

.

BACKGROUND
&
AIMS
:
Activation
of
NF
-
kappaB
/
Rel
has
been
implicated
in
the
pathogenesis
of
inflammatory
bowel
disease
(
IBD
)
.

Various
drugs
used
in
the
treatment
of
IBD
,
such
as
glucocorticoids
,
5
-
aminosalicylic
acid
,
and
sulfasalazine
,
interfere
with
NF
-
kappaB
/
Rel
signaling
.

The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
define
the
molecular
mechanism
by
which
sulfasalazine
inhibits
NF
-
kappaB
activation
.

METHODS
:
The
effects
of
sulfasalazine
and
its
moieties
on
NF
-
kappaB
signaling
were
evaluated
using
electromobility
shift
,
transfection
,
and
immune
complex
kinase
assays
.

The
direct
effect
of
sulfasalazine
on
IkappaB
kinase
(
IKK
)
activity
was
investigated
using
purified
recombinant
IKK
-
alpha
and
-
beta
proteins
.

was
inhibited

dependently
by
sulfasalazine
.

Sulfasalazine
inhibited

induced
activation
of
endogenous
IKK
in
Jurkat

,
as
well
as
the
catalytic
activity
of
purified
IKK
-
alpha
and
IKK
-
beta
in

.

In
contrast
,
the
moieties
of
sulfasalazine
,
5
-
aminosalicylic
acid
,
and
sulfapyridine
or
4
-
aminosalicylic
acid
had
no
effect
.

Activation
of

,
c
-
Jun
-
N
-
terminal
kinase
(
JNK
)

,
and
p38
was
unaffected
by
sulfasalazine
.

The
decrease
in
substrate
phosphorylation
by
IKK
-
alpha
and
-
beta
is
associated
with
a
decrease
in
autophosphorylation
of
IKKs
and
can
be
antagonized
by
excess
adenosine
triphosphate
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
These
data
identify
sulfasalazine
as
a
direct
inhibitor
of
IKK
-
alpha
and
-
beta
by
antagonizing
adenosine
triphosphate
binding
.

The
suppression
of
NF
-
kappaB
activation
by
inhibition
of
the
IKKs
contributes
to
the
well
-
known
anti
-
inflammatory
and
immunosuppressive
effects
of
sulfasalazine
.

of
the
highest
specific
activities
and
was
the
only
isoform
induced
by
oxidative
stress
and
by
agents
that
deplete
glutathione
(
ethacrynic
acid
)
.

Several
hydroxysteroid
dehydrogenases
of
the
AKR1C
subfamily
catalyzed
the
reduction
of
HNE
with
higher
activity
than
aldehyde
reductase
(
AKR1A1
)
.

NMR
spectroscopy
identified
the
product
of
the
NADPH
-
dependent
reduction
of
HNE
as
1
,
4
-
dihydroxy
-
2
-
nonene
.

The

recombinant
AKR1C1

)
suggested
that
it
is
primed
for
reductive
metabolism
of
HNE
.

Isoform
-
specific
reverse
transcription
-
polymerase
chain
reaction
showed
that
exposure
of
HepG2
cells
to
HNE
resulted
in
elevated
levels
of
AKR1C1
mRNA
.

Thus
,
HNE
induces
its
own
metabolism
via
AKR1C1
,
and
this
enzyme
may
play
a
hitherto
unrecognized
role
in
a
response
mounted
to
counter
oxidative
stress
.

AKRs
represent
alternative
GSH
-
independent
/
NADPH
-
dependent
routes
for
the
reductive
elimination
of
HNE
.

Of
these
,
AKR1C1
provides
an
inducible
cytosolic
barrier
to
HNE
following
ROS
exposure
.

Stable

(

)
,
generated
by
nitric

(
NOS
II
)
from
immunostimulated
cells
during
infection
,
plays
an
important
role
in
host
immune

against

.

The
impact
of
different
rates
of

on

has
not
been
defined
.

Herein
,
we
describe
the
development
of
a
method
to
express
varied
levels
of
murine
NOS
II
in
bovine
pulmonary
artery
endothelial
cells
.

A
retroviral
vector
(
pMFGSNOS
)
encoding
NOS
II
was
used
to
transduce
primary
cultures
of
endothelial
cells
.

Bovine
endothelial
cells
were
susceptible
to
this
transduction
and
up
to
18
%
of
the
cells
expressed
immunodetectable
murine
NOS
II
.

The
NOS
II
-
transduced
endothelial
cells
were
cultured
on
the
three
-
dimensional
matrix
,
Gelfoam
,
for
8
-
10
days
.

Stable
expression
of
NOS
II
was
assessed
by
measuring
nitrite
accumulation
in
media
every
2
days
.

By
day
10
,
endothelial
cells
on
Gelfoam
were
found
to
secrete
NO
*
at
a
rate
exceeding
1
.

,
concomitant
with
an
enhanced
level
of

activity
.

Argininosuccinate
synthetase
,
a
key
enzyme
in
the
metabolism
of
l
-
citrulline
to
l
-
arginine
,
increased
as
well
,
perhaps
in
response
to
dimunition
of
the
intracellular
arginine
pool
corresponding
to
the
observed
high
output
of
NO
*
.

In
spite
of
the
continuous
flux
of
NO
*
,
endothelial
cell
viability
was
not
effected
.

This
system
provides
the
opportunity
to
assess
the
impact
of
different
levels
of
sustained
NO

production
on
endothelial
cell
physiology
.

Effects
of
eletriptan
on
the
peptidergic
innervation
of
the
cerebral
dura
mater
and
trigeminal
ganglion
,
and
on
the
expression
of
c
-
fos
and
c
-
jun
in
the
trigeminal
complex
of
the
rat
in
an
experimental
migraine
model
.

Nociceptive
axons
and
terminals
in
the
supratentorial
cerebral
dura
mater
display
an
intense
calcitonin
gene
-
related
peptide
(
CGRP
)
immunoreactivity
.

In
an
experimental
migraine
model
,
it
has
been
shown
that
electrical
stimulation
of
the
rat
trigeminal
ganglion
induced
an
increase
in
the
lengths
of
CGRP
-
immunoreactive
axons
,
increased
size
and
number
of
pleomorphic
axonal
varicosities
in
the
dura
mater
,
and
an
increased
number
of
c
-
jun
and
c
-
fos
protein
-
expressing
nerve
cells
in
the
trigeminal
complex
.

We
demonstrate
the
effect
of
the
highly
specific
and
moderately
lipophilic
serotonin
agonist
eletriptan
(
Pfizer
)
which
prevents
the
effects
of
electrical
stimulation
in
the
dura
mater
.

Eletriptan
also
affected
the
caudal
trigeminal
complex
;
it
markedly
reduced
the
numbers
of
the
oncoprotein
-
expressing
cells
,
mainly
after
stimulation
and
to
some
extent
also
in
nonstimulated
animals
.

Eletriptan
also
affected
expression
of
CGRP
in
perikarya
of
trigeminal
ganglion
cells
,
insofar
as
the
number
of
small
nerve
cells
exhibiting
a
compact
CGRP
immunoreaction
was
decreased
to
one
quarter
of
the
original
value
.

In
all
these
respects
,
eletriptan
acted
in
a
similar
way
to
sumatriptan
,
with
the
notable
exception
that
eletriptan
also
blocked
the
stimulation
-
induced
effects
in
the
nucleus
caudalis
trigemini
and
the
upper
cervical
spinal
cord
(
trigeminal
complex
)
,
whereas
sumatriptan
did
not
.

It
is
concluded
that
eletriptan
,
acting
on
perikarya
and
both
the
peripheral
and
the
central
axon
terminals
of
primary
sensory
neurons
,
exerts
its
antimigraine
effect
by
an
agonist
action
on
5
-
HT1B
/
1D
receptors
throughout
the
entire
trigeminal
system
,
probably
by
passing
the
blood
-
brain
-
barrier
because
of
its
lipophilic
character
.

Human
peptidylarginine
deiminase
type

:
molecular
cloning
and
nucleotide
sequence
of
the
cDNA
,
properties
of
the
recombinant
enzyme
,
and
immunohistochemical
localization
in
human
skin
.

Peptidylarginine
deiminase
catalyzes
the
post
-
translational
modification
of
proteins
through
the
conversion
of
arginine
to
citrulline
in
the
presence
of
calcium
ions
.

In
rodents
,
peptidylarginine
deiminase
has
been
classified
into
four
isoforms
,
types
I
,
II
,
III
,
and
IV
,
which
are
distinct
in
their
molecular
weights
,
substrate
specificities
,
and
tissue
localization
.

Of
these
isoforms
,
only
type
III
was
detected
in
epidermis
and
hair
follicles
.

Although
the
role
of
this
enzyme
in
these
tissues
is
not
yet
clear
,
indirect
data
have
shown
that
several
structural
proteins
such
as
filaggrin
,
trichohyalin
,
and
keratin
are
substrates
for
peptidylarginine
deiminase
.

In
this
study
,
we
cloned
the
full
-
length
cDNA
of
human
peptidylarginine
deiminase
type
III
(
3142
bp
)
from
cultured
human
keratinocytes
by
reverse
transcription
-
polymerase
chain
reaction
and
by
rapid
amplification
of
cDNA
ends
methods
.

This
cDNA
contained
a
1995
bp
open
reading
frame
encoding
664
amino
acids
(
Mr
=
74
770
)
.

To
explore
the
physicochemical
and
enzymatic
properties
of
human
peptidylarginine
deiminase
type
III
,
we
constructed
a
plasmid
for
producing
a
recombinant
human
peptidylarginine
deiminase
type
III
in
bacteria
.

The
enzymatic
characteristics
of
the
recombinant
enzyme
were
very
similar
to
those
of
the
rodent
peptidylarginine
deiminase
type
III
.

The
recombinant
enzyme
showed
the
catalytic
activities
toward
structural
proteins
of
epidermis
and
hair
follicle
,
filaggrin
and
trichohyalin
,
in
which
the
deiminations
maxima
of
about
60
%
and
13
%
arginine
residues
were
observed
in
filaggrin
and
trichohyalin
,
respectively
.

An
immunohistochemical
study
of
human
scalp
skin
with
a
monospecific
anti
-
peptidyl
-
arginine
deiminase
type
III
antibody
revealed
that
the
type
III
enzyme
was
localized
to
the
inner
root
sheath
and
outer
root
sheath
of
hair
follicles
.

Peptidylarginine
deiminase
type
III
in
the
inner
root
sheath
was
notable
between
supramatrix
and
keratogenous
zone
and
was
scarcely
detected
in
cornified
hair
zone
.

The
enzyme
was
also
expressed
in
the
cuticle
layer
of
hair
.

On
the
other
hand
,
expression
of
the
enzyme
in
the
epidermis
was
very
low
.

These
data
imply
that
human
peptidylarginine
deiminase
type
III
is
the
predominant
isoform
in
hair
follicles
and
may
function
as
a
modulator
of
hair
structural
proteins
,
including
trichohyalin
during
hair
and
hair
follicle
formation
.

Coinduction
of
inducible
nitric
oxide
synthase
and
arginine
recycling
enzymes
in
cytokine
-
stimulated
PC12
cells
and
high
output
production
of
nitric
oxide
.

Nitric
oxide
(
NO
)
is
involved
in
many
physiological
and
pathological
processes
in
the
brain
.

NO
is
synthesized
from
arginine
by
nitric
oxide
synthase
(
NOS
)
,
and
the
citrulline
generated
as
a
by
-
product
can
be
recycled
to
arginine
by
argininosuccinate
synthetase
(
AS
)
and
argininosuccinate
lyase
(
AL
)
via
the
citrulline
-
NO
cycle
.

When
neuronal
PC12
cells
differentiated
with
nerve
growth
factor
were
treated
with
interferon
-
gamma
(
IFNgamma
)
and
tumor
necrosis
factor
-
alpha
(
TNFalpha
)
,
iNOS
and
AS
mRNAs
and
proteins
were
markedly
induced
,
with
AL
mRNA
and
protein
being
weakly
induced
.

Cationic
amino
acid
transporter
-
1
and
-
2
were
not
induced
.

IFNgamma
or
TNFalpha
alone
was
ineffective
.

A
large
amount
of
NO
(
190
microM
NO
(
2
)
(
-
)
plus
NO
(
3
)
(
-
)
in
culture
medium
in
24
h
)
was
produced
from
arginine
by
cytokine
-
stimulated
cells
,
and
arginine
could
be
replaced
by
citrulline
.

iNOS
induction
and
NO
production
were
attenuated
by
dexamethasone
and
dibutyryl
cAMP
and
even
more
strongly
so
when
combined
.

Therefore
,
a
large
amount
of
NO
is
produced
in
cytokine
-
stimulated
PC12
cells
following
to
induction
of
iNOS
and
citrulline
-
arginine
recycling
is
important
for
NO
production
.

The
new
cholinesterase
inhibitors
for

Part

:
their
similarities
are
different
.

Three
new
cholinesterase
inhibitors
,
donepezil
,
rivastigmine
,
and
galantamine
,
all
inhibit
the
enzyme
AChE
.

Rivastigmine
also
inhibits
BuChE
,
which
could
lead
to
additional
benefits
in
late
-
stage
Alzheimer
'
s
disease
,
but
also
cause
more
GI
side
effects
at
initiation
of
therapy
.

Galantamine
is
also
an
allosteric
modulator
of
nicotinic
receptors
,
which
could
lead
to
additional
efficacy
for
attention
and
for
behaviors
mediated
by
neurotransmitters
other
than
ACh
.

We
are
now
entering
an
exciting
era
where
the
options
for
treating
the
devastating
illness
Alzheimer
'
s
disease
are
multiplying
and
creating
a
foundation
upon
which
new
therapies
with
new
mechanisms
of
action
can
be
built
.

Biochemistry
of
cyclooxygenase
(
COX
)
-
2
inhibitors
and
molecular
pathology
of
COX
-
2
in
neoplasia
.

Several
types
of
human
tumors
overexpress
cyclooxygenase
(
COX
)
-
2
but
not
COX
-
1
,
and
gene
knockout
transfection
experiments
demonstrate
a
central
role
of
COX
-
2
in
experimental
tumorigenesis
.

COX
-
2
produces
prostaglandins
that
inhibit
apoptosis
and
stimulate
angiogenesis
and
invasiveness
.

Selective
COX
-
2
inhibitors
reduce
prostaglandin
synthesis
,
restore
apoptosis
,
and
inhibit
cancer
cell
proliferation
.

In
animal
studies
they
limit
carcinogen
-
induced
tumorigenesis
.

In
contrast
,
aspirin
-
like
nonselective
NSAIDs
such
as
sulindac
and
indomethacin
inhibit
not
only
the
enzymatic
action
of
the
highly
inducible
,
proinflammatory
COX
-
2
but
the
constitutively
expressed
,
cytoprotective
COX
-
1
as
well
.

Consequently
,
nonselective
NSAIDs
can
cause
platelet
dysfunction
,
gastrointestinal
ulceration
,
and
kidney
damage
.

For
that
reason
,
selective
inhibition
of
COX
-
2
to
treat
neoplastic
proliferation
is
preferable
to
nonselective
inhibition
.

Selective
COX
-
2
inhibitors
,
such
as
meloxicam
,
celecoxib
(
SC
-
58635
)
,
and
rofecoxib
(
MK
-
0966
)
,
are
NSAIDs
that
have
been
modified
chemically
to
preferentially
inhibit
COX
-
2
but
not
COX
-
1
.

For
instance
,
meloxicam
inhibits
the
growth
of
cultured
colon
cancer
cells
(
HCA
-
7
and
Moser
-
S
)
that
express
COX
-
2
but
has
no
effect
on
HCT
-
116
tumor
cells
that
do
not
express
COX
-
2
.

NS
-
398
induces
apoptosis
in
COX
-
2
expressing
LNCaP
prostate
cancer
cells
and
,
surprisingly
,
in
colon
cancer
S
/
KS
cells
that
does
not
express
COX
-
2
.

This
effect
may
due
to
induction
of
apoptosis
through
uncoupling
of
oxidative
phosphorylation
and
down
-
regulation
of
Bcl
-
2
,
as
has
been
demonstrated
for
some
nonselective
NSAIDs
,
for
instance
,
flurbiprofen
.

COX
-
2
mRNA
and
COX
-
2
protein
is
constitutively
expressed
in
the
kidney
,
brain
,
spinal
cord
,
and
ductus
deferens
,
and
in
the
uterus
during
implantation
.

In
addition
,
COX
-
2
is
constitutively
and
dominantly
expressed
in
the
pancreatic
islet
cells
.

These
findings
might
somewhat
limit
the
use
of
presently
available
selective
COX
-
2
inhibitors
in
cancer
prevention
but
will
probably
not
deter
their
successful
application
for
the
treatment
of
human
cancers
.

Sulfonylurea
sensitivity
of
adenosine
triphosphate
-
sensitive
potassium
channels
from
beta
cells
and
extrapancreatic
tissues
.

Sulfonylureas
are
widely
used
to
stimulate
insulin
secretion
in
type
2
diabetic
patients
because
they
close
adenosine
triphosphate
-
sensitive
potassium
(
K
(
ATP
)
)
channels
in
the
pancreatic
beta
-
cell
membrane
.

This
action
is
mediated
by
binding
of
the
drug
to
the
sulfonylurea
receptor
(
SUR1
)
subunit
of
the
channel
.

K
(
ATP
)
channels
are
also
present
in
a
range
of
extrapancreatic
tissues
,
but
many
of
these
contain
an
alternative
type
of
SUR
subunit
(
SUR2A
in
heart
and
SUR2B
in
smooth
muscle
)
.

The
sulfonylurea
-
sensitivity
of
K
(
ATP
)
channels
containing
the
different
types
of
SUR
is
variable
:
gliclazide
and
tolbutamide
block
the
beta
cell
,
but
not
the
cardiac
or
smooth
muscle
types
of
K
(
ATP
)
channels
with
high
affinity
.

Glibenclamide
and
glimepiride
,
on
the
other
hand
,
block
channels
containing
SUR1
and
SUR2
with
similar
affinity
.

The
reversibility
of
the
different
sulfonylureas
also
varies
.

Tolbutamide
and
gliclazide
produce
a
reversible
inhibition
of
Kir6
.
2
/
SUR1
and
Kir6
.
2
/
SUR2
channels
,
whereas
glibenclamide
has
a
reversible
effect
on
cardiac
,
but
not
beta
-
cell
,
K
(
ATP
)
channels
.

In
this
article
,
we
summarize
current
knowledge
of
how
sulfonylureas
act
on
K
(
ATP
)
channels
containing
the
different
types
of
sulfonylurea
receptor
,
and
discuss
the
implications
of
these
findings
for
the
use
of
sulfonylureas
in
the
treatment
of
diabetes
mellitus
.

Determination
of
residues
in
the
norepinephrine
transporter
that
are
critical
for
tricyclic
antidepressant
affinity
.

The
norepinephrine
(
NET
)
and
dopamine
(
DAT
)
transporters
are
highly
homologous
proteins
,
displaying
many
pharmacological
similarities
.

Both
transport
dopamine
with
higher
affinity
than
norepinephrine
and
are
targets
for
the
psychostimulants
cocaine
and
amphetamine
.

However
,
they
strikingly
contrast
in
their
affinities
for
tricyclic
antidepressants
(
TCA
)
.

Previous
studies
,
based
on
chimeric
proteins
between
DAT
and
NET
suggest
that
domains
ranging
from
putative
transmembrane
domain
(
TMD
)
5
to
8
are
involved
in
the
high
affinity
binding
of
TCA
to
NET
.

We
substituted
24
amino
acids
within
this
region
in
the
human
NET
with
their
counterparts
in
the
human
DAT
,
resulting
in
22
different
mutants
.

Mutations
of
residues
located
in
extra
-
or
intracytoplasmic
loops
have
no
effect
on
binding
affinity
of
neither
TCA
nor
cocaine
.

Three
point
mutations
in
TMD6
(
F316C
)
,
-
7
(
V356S
)
,
and
-
8
(
G400L
)
induced
a
loss
of
TCA
binding
affinity
of
8
-
,
5
-
,
and
4
-
fold
,
respectively
,
without
affecting
the
affinity
of
cocaine
.

The
triple
mutation
F316C
/
V356S
/
G400L
produced

These

residues
are
strongly

cloned

A

(

was
also
observed
for

.

Reverse

did
not
elicit

resulted
in
a

increase
in

,
respectively
.

Our
results
clearly
indicate
that
two
residues
located
in
TMD6
and
-
7
of
hNET
may
play
an
important
role
in
TCA
interaction
and
that
a

is
likely
to
be
involved
in
the

Lyprinol
:
anti
-
inflammatory
and
uterine
-
relaxant
activities
in
rats
,
with
special
reference
to
a
model
for
dysmenorrhoea
.

Lyprinol
exhibits
anti
-
inflammatory
activity
distinct
from
that
of
most
NSAIDs
,
controlling
chronic
but
not
acute
inflammation
.

Unlike
Cox
-
1
inhibitors
(
aspirin
,
meclofenamic
acid
)
it
is
not
gastro
-
toxic
.

Predosing
rats
with
Lyprinol
can
modify
both
(
i
)
the
spontaneous
and
(
ii
)
the
oxytocin
-
induced
contractions
of
the
uterus
.

In
humans
there
is
anecdotal
evidence
that
Lyprinol
can
relieve
dysmenorrhea
.

This
report
explores
the
concept
that
the
uterotrophic
actions
of
Lyprinol
are
conditioned
by
:
the
intrinsic
profile
of
estrogenic
hormones
and
progestagens
and
,
certain
extrinsic
stimuli
.

Evidence
from
in
vitro
studies
indicates
that
Lyprinol
is
not
a
smooth
muscle
relaxant
and
that
its
uterotrophic
mechanism
is
not
that
of
a
cyclo
-
oxygenase
inhibitor
,
but
may
mimic
that
of
a
leukotriene
receptor
antagonist
.

NMDA
and
glutamate
evoke
excitotoxicity
at
distinct
cellular
locations
in
rat
cortical
neurons
in
vitro
.

The
development
of
cortical
neurons
in
vivo
and
in
vitro
is
accompanied
by
alterations
in
NMDA
receptor
subunit
expression
and
concomitant
modifications
in
the
pharmacological
profile
of
NMDA
-
activated
ionic
currents
.

For
example
,
we
observed
that
with
decreasing
NR2B
/
NR2A
subunit
expression
ratio
,
the
block
of
NMDA
receptor
-
mediated
whole
-
cell
responses
by
the
NR2B
-
selective
antagonist
haloperidol
was
also
decreased
.

In
mature
cultures
(
>
22
d
in
vitro
)
,
however
,
NMDA
responses
obtained
from
excised
nucleated
macropatches
,
which
comprised
a
large
portion
of
the
soma
,
remained
strongly
antagonized
by
haloperidol
.

These
results
suggest
that
in
more
mature
neurons
NR1
/
NR2B
receptors
appear
to
be
preferentially
expressed
in
the
cell
body
.

As
predicted
from
the
whole
-
cell
recording
pharmacological
profile
,
NMDA
-
induced
toxicity
was
largely
unaffected
by
haloperidol
in
mature
cultures
.

However
,
haloperidol
effectively
blocked
glutamate
toxicity
in
the
same
cultures
,
suggesting
that
the
neurotoxic
actions
of
this
amino
acid
were
mostly
due
to
the
activation
of
somatic
NMDA
receptors
.

In
experiments
in
which
the
potency
of
glutamate
toxicity
was
increased
by
the
transport
inhibitor
l
-
trans
-
pyrrolidine
-
2
,
4
-
dicarboxylic
acid
,
the
neuroprotective
effects
of
haloperidol
were
significantly
diminished
.

This
was
likely
because
of
the
fact
that
glutamate
,
now
toxic
at
much
lower
concentrations
,
was
able
to
reach
and
activate
dendritic
receptors
under
these
conditions
.

These
results
strongly
argue
that
exogenous
glutamate
and
NMDA
normally
induce
excitotoxicity
at
distinct
cellular
locations
in
mature
mixed
neuronal
cultures
and
that
NR1
/
NR2B
receptors
remain
an
important
component
in
the
expression
of
glutamate
,
but
not
NMDA
-
induced
excitotoxicity
.

,
whereas

This
suggests
that
the

is
mediated
by

receptors
,
while
quipazine

by

The

inhibited

The

is
an

the

of

is

In

,
we
identified
one
significant
difference
:
the
Vmax
of
carcinoid
AAAD
was
50

fold
higher
than
that
in
normal

.

Here

we

quantities
of
AAAD
polypeptide
and

in

as

compared
with

.

To
assess
the
feasibility
of
targeting
these
high
AAAD
levels
for
chemotherapy
,
AAAD
inhibitors
carbidopa

were

;

On

to

For
lung
tumor
lines
(
carcinoid
,
two
SCLC

and
one
large
cell

)
,
AAAD
activity
was
correlated
with
the
potency
of
carbidopa

.

However
,
carcinoid
cell
death
was
not
solely
attributable
to
complete
inhibition
of
either
AAAD
activity
or
the
serotonin
synthetic
pathway
.

In
further
evaluating
potential
applications
of
these
findings
with
carbidopa
,
we
determined
that
sublethal
doses
of
carbidopa
produced
additive
cytotoxic
effects
in
carcinoid
cells
in
combination
with
etoposide
and
cytotoxic
synergy
in
