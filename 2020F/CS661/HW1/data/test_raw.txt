Among

Pyridoxal-5'-phosphate
(
PLP
)
,
the
bioactive
form
of
vitamin
B6
,
reportedly
functions
as
a
prosthetic
group
for
>4%
of
classified
enzymatic
activities
of
the
cell
.

It
is
therefore
not
surprising
that
alterations
of
vitamin
B6
metabolism
have
been
associated
with
multiple
human
diseases
.

As
a
striking
example
,
mutations
in
the
gene
coding
for
antiquitin
,
an
evolutionary
old
aldehyde
dehydrogenase
,
result
in
pyridoxine-dependent
seizures
,
owing
to
the
accumulation
of
a
metabolic
intermediate
that
inactivates
PLP
.

In
addition
,
PLP
is
required
for
the
catabolism
of
homocysteine
by
transsulfuration
.

Hence
,
reduced
circulating
levels
of
B6
vitamers
(
including
PLP
as
well
as
its
major
precursor
pyridoxine
)
are
frequently
paralleled
by
hyperhomocysteinemia
,
a
condition
that
has
been
associated
with
an
increased
risk
for
multiple
cardiovascular
diseases
.

During
the
past
30
years
,
an
intense
wave
of
clinical
investigation
has
attempted
to
dissect
the
putative
links
between
vitamin
B6
and
cancer
.

Thus
,
high
circulating
levels
of
vitamin
B6
,
as
such
or
as
they
reflected
reduced
amounts
of
circulating
homocysteine
,
have
been
associated
with
improved
disease
outcome
in
patients
bearing
a
wide
range
of
hematological
and
solid
neoplasms
.

More
recently
,
the
proficiency
of
vitamin
B6
metabolism
has
been
shown
to
modulate
the
adaptive
response
of
tumor
cells
to
a
plethora
of
physical
and
chemical
stress
conditions
.

Moreover
,
elevated
levels
of
pyridoxal
kinase
(
PDXK
)
,
the
enzyme
that
converts
pyridoxine
and
other
vitamin
B6
precursors
into
PLP
,
have
been
shown
to
constitute
a
good
,
therapy-independent
prognostic
marker
in
patients
affected
by
non-small
cell
lung
carcinoma
(
NSCLC
)

we

the

The
mechanisms
of
progression
from
Barrett's
esophagus
(
BE
)
to
esophageal
adenocarcinoma
(
EA
)
are
not
known
.

Cycloxygenase-2
(
COX-2
)
-derived
prostaglandin
E2
(
PGE2
)
has
been
shown
to
be
important
in
esophageal
tumorigenesis
.

We
have
shown
that
COX-2
mediates
acid-induced
PGE2
production
.

The
prostaglandin
E
synthase
(
PGES
)
responsible
for
acid-induced
PGE2
production
in
BE
,
however
,
is
not
known
.

We
found
that
microsomal
PGES1
(
mPGES1
)
,
mPGES2
,
and
cytosolic
PGES
(
cPGES
)
were
present
in
FLO
EA
cells
.

Pulsed
acid
treatment
significantly
increased
mPGES1
mRNA
and
protein
levels
but
had
little
or
no
effect
on
mPGES2
or
cPGES
mRNA
.

Knockdown
of
mPGES1
by
mPGES1
small
interfering
RNA
(
siRNA
)
blocked
acid-induced
increase
in
PGE2
production
and
thymidine
incorporation
.

Knockdown
of
NADPH
oxidase
,
NOX5-S
,
a
variant
lacking
calcium-binding
domains
,
by
NOX5
siRNA
significantly
inhibited
acid-induced
increase
in
mPGES1
expression
,
thymidine
incorporation
,
and
PGE2
production
.

Overexpression
of
NOX5-S
significantly
increased
the
luciferase
activity
in
FLO
cells
transfected
with
a
nuclear
factor
κB
(
NF-κB
)
in
vivo
activation
reporter
plasmid
pNF-κB-Luc
.

Knockdown
of
NF-κB1
p50
by
p50
siRNA
significantly
decreased
acid-induced
increase
in
mPGES1
expression
,
thymidine
incorporation
,
and
PGE2
production
.

Two
novel
NF-κB
binding
elements
,
GGAGTCTCCC
and
CGGGACACCC
,
were
identified
in
the
mPGES1
gene
promoter
.

We
conclude
that
mPGES1
mediates
acid-induced
increase
in
PGE2
production
and
cell
proliferation
.

Acid-induced
mPGES1
expression
depends
on
activation
of
NOX5-S
and
NF-κB1
p50
.

Microsomal
PGES1
may
be

PURPOSE
:
Activating
mutations
in
FGFR2
have
been
identified
as
potential
therapeutic
targets
in
endometrial
cancer
,
typically
occurring
alongside
genetic
alterations
that
disrupt
the
mTOR
pathway
,
such
as
PTEN
loss
.

These
observations
suggest
that
the
mTOR
pathway
may
act
in
concert
with
oncogenic
FGFR2
to
drive
endometrial
cancer
growth
in
a
subset
of
patients
.

The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
examine
the
therapeutic
potential
of
a
rational
drug
combination
based
on
the
simultaneous
targeting
of
mutant-FGFR2
and
mTOR-driven
signaling
pathways
in
endometrial
cancer
cells
.

METHODS
:
Ponatinib
is
an
oral
multitargeted
kinase
inhibitor
that
potently
inhibits
all
4
members
of
the
FGFR
family
.

Ridaforolimus
is
a
selective
inhibitor
of
mTOR
that
has
demonstrated
positive
clinical
activity
in
endometrial
cancer
.

The
combinatorial
effects
of
ponatinib
and
ridaforolimus
on
growth
of
endometrial
cancer
models
,
and
their
modes
of
action
,
were
evaluated
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
.

RESULTS
:
The
combination
of
ponatinib
and
ridaforolimus
had
a
synergistic
effect
on
the
in
vitro
growth
of
endometrial
lines
bearing
an
activating
FGFR2
mutation
,
irrespective
of
PTEN
status
.

Concomitant
inhibition
of
both
FGFR2
and
mTOR
signaling
pathways
was
observed
,
with
simultaneous
blockade
resulting
in
enhanced
cell
cycle
arrest
.

Ponatinib
and
ridaforolimus
each
demonstrated
inhibition
of
tumor
growth
in
vivo
,
but
dual
inhibition
by
the
combination
of
agents
resulted
in
superior
efficacy
and
induced
tumor
regression
in
an
endometrial
xenograft
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
These
encouraging
preclinical
findings
suggest
the
inhibition
of
both
FGFR2
and
mTOR
by
the
ponatinib-ridaforolimus
combination
may
provide
a
new
therapeutic
strategy
to
treat
advanced
endometrial
cancers
with
dual
pathway
dysregulation
.

Increased

has
been
implicated
in
a
number
of
thrombotic
disorders
.

The
present
studies
were
undertaken
to
determine
whether
stable
analogues
of
prostacyclin
,
a
potent
endothelium-derived
platelet
inhibitor
and
vasodilator
,
could
inhibit
tissue
factor
expression
by
human
monocytic
cells
.

Exposure

2
units

or
5
ng

for
4
hours
led
to
increased
tissue
factor
procoagulant
activity
.

Preincubation
for
30
minutes
with
iloprost
,
ciprostene
,
and
carbacyclin
led
to
a
dose-dependent
inhibition
of
tissue
factor
expression
induced
by
all
three
challenging
agents
.

Iloprost
was
the
most
potent
:
50%
inhibition
occurred
at
5
nM
,
a
concentration
close
to
the
reported
dissociation
constant
for
iloprost
binding
to
the
platelet
prostacyclin
receptor
.

An
orally
active
analogue
,
cicaprost
,
was
equally
effective
against
endotoxin-induced
tissue
factor
expression
.

Carbacyclin
and
ciprostene
were
100
times
less
potent
.

Iloprost
prevented
the
endotoxin-induced
expression
of
tissue
factor
antigen
on
the
surface
of
THP-1
cells
,
as
determined
by
flow
cytometry
.

Iloprost
(
500
pM-50
nM
)
increased
intracellular
levels
of
cyclic
AMP
.

This
effect
was
potentiated
by
isobutylmethylxanthine
,
an
inhibitor
of
phosphodiesterase
.

The
inhibitory
effects
of
iloprost
on
tissue
factor
expression
were
also
potentiated
by
isobutylmethylxanthine
and
mimicked
by
forskolin
and
dibutyryl
cyclic
AMP
but
not
dibutyryl
cyclic
GMP
.

These
results
suggest
that
prostacyclin
may
play
a
role
in
downregulating
tissue
factor
expression
in
monocytes
,
at
least
in
part
via
elevation
of
intracellular
levels
of
cyclic
AMP
.

Alcohol
is
one
of
the
most
commonly
abused
substances
,
and
its
chronic
intake
leads
to
the
development
of
ethanol
dependence
in
both
humans
and
laboratory
animals
.

In
many
countries
,
a
mu-opioid
receptor
antagonist
naltrexone
has
been
used
in
the
treatment
of
alcohol
dependence
.

The
introduction
of
naltrexone
for
the
treatment
of
alcohol
dependence
has
been
mainly
based
on
behavioral
animal
models
that
provide
evidence
of
the
involvement
of
the
endogenous
opioid
system
in
alcohol
drinking
and
dependence
.

It
has
been
well
known
that
alcohol
leads
to
the
activation
of
the
endogenous
opioid
system
.

The
endogenous
opioid
agonists
,
such
as
beta-endorphin
,
increase
the
activity
of
the
mesolimbic
dopaminergic
system
through
the
inhibition
of
the
gamma-aminobutyric
acid
(
GABA
)
-containing
inhibitory
interneurons
in
the
ventral
tegmental
area
,
resulting
in
the
expression
of
alcohol
reinforcement
and
/
or
rewarding
effect
.

Therefore
,
naltrexone
,
which
is
useful
for
alcohol
dependence
therapy
,
may
attenuate
the
rewarding
effect
of
ethanol
by
interfering
with
the
ethanol-induced
stimulation
of
the
mesolimbic
dopaminergic
system
.

The
following
review
provides
a
summary
of
the
interactions
between
endogenous
opioid
system
and
mesolimbic
dopaminergic
system
in
alcohol
dependence
.

The

on
the
fidelity
of
many
protein-protein
interactions
,
which
act
to
bring
together
signaling
intermediates
at
defined
locations
within
cells
.

In
the

,
cAMP
participates
in
the
fine
control
of
excitation-contraction
coupling
,
hence
,
any
disregulation
of
this
signaling
cascade
can
lead
to
cardiac

.

Due
to
the
ubiquitous
nature
of
the
cAMP
pathway
,
general
inhibitors
of
cAMP
signaling
proteins
such
as
PKA
,

would
act
non-specifically

increasing
the

Osteoporosis
is
a
common
disease
characterized
by
an

susceptibility
to
fracture
.

It
is
a
complex
disorder
resulting
from
the
interaction
of
several
polymorphisms
in
different
genes
and
environmental
factors
.

Since
we
recently
reported
a
role
for
low
density
lipoprotein-related
protein
(
LRP
)

in
monogenic
disorders
with

gene
has
an
effect
on
the

Bone

measurements
of

were
available
for
a

of

Danish
men
from
two

groups
(

years
]
:
n
=
804;
[
60-74

]
:
n
=
600
)
.

Using
linear
regression
analysis
adjusted
for
age
,

,
we
found
significant
associations
between
both
rs2306029
and
rs6485702
and
BMD
at
all
sites
except
the
lumbar
spine
.

The
most
significant
association
was
found
with
whole
body
BMD
(
p

)
.

In
addition
,
we
found
these
two
polymorphisms
to
be
associated
with
different
geometry
parameters
especially
of
the
femoral
shaft
.

Analysis
of
the
two
associated
SNPs
in
the
separate
age
groups
demonstrated
that
most
associations
are
only
present
in
the
youngest
group
of
Danish

.

In
the
group
of
elderly
men
,
one
Bonferroni
corrected
association
between
whole

was
found
to

found
to
be
of
particular
interest
in
the
regulation
of
hip

whole

(
AGCG
,

)
.

Additional
analysis
suggested
that
these
latter
associations
are
driven
by
the
association
of
rs6485702
.

We
suggest
,
based
on
these
results
and
the
localisation
of
the
variant
in
the
third
β-propeller
domain
of
LRP4
,
that
the
variant
has
possibly
a
functional
effect
.

Hereby
,
we
conclude
that
common
variation
in
the
LRP4
gene
determines
hip
and
whole
body
BMD
and
thus
confirm
previous
results
from
different
GWAs
.

In
addition
,
our
data
proves
an
additional
role
for
LRP4
in
regulating
hip

.

Saturation

revealed
that

Incoherent
neutron
scattering
is
one
of
the
most
powerful
tools
for
studying
dynamics
in
biological
matter
.

Using
the

spectrometer
IN16
at
the
Institut
Laue

(
ILL
,
Grenoble
,
France
)
,
temperature

(

from

:
hBChE;
recombinant
human

and
recombinant
mouse
acetylcholinesterase
:
mAChE
)
was
examined
using
elastic
incoherent
neutron
scattering
(
EINS
)
.

The
dynamics
was
characterized
by
the
averaged
atomic
mean
square
displacement
(
MSD
)
,
associated
with
the
sample
flexibility
at
a
given
temperature
.

We
found
MSD
values
of
hAChE
above
the
dynamical
transition
temperature
(
around
200K
)
larger
than
for
mAChE
and
hBChE
,
implying
that
hAChE
is
more
flexible
than
the
other
ChEs
.

Activation
energies
for
thermodynamical
transition
were
extracted
through
the
frequency

model
(

)
(

)
[

]
and
turned
out
to
increase
from
hBChE
to
mAChE
and
finally
to
hAChE
,
inversely
to
the
MSDs
relations
.

Between
280
and
316K
,
catalytic
studies
of
these
enzymes
were
carried
out
using
thiocholine
esters
:
at
the
same
temperature
,
the
hAChE
activity
was
systematically
higher
than
the
mAChE
or
hBChE
ones
.

Our
results
thus
suggest
a
strong
correlation
between
dynamics
and
activity
within
the
ChE
family
.

We
also
studied
and
compared
the
ChEs

inactivation

.

Here
,
no
direct
correlation
with
the
dynamics
was
observed
,
thus
suggesting
that
relations
between
enzyme
dynamics
and
catalytic
stability
are
more
complex
.

Finally
,
the
possible
relation
between
flexibility
and
protein

to
grow
in

is
discussed

The
pharmacological
dosage
of
dehydroepiandrosterone
(
DHEA
)
protects
against
chemically
induced
carcinogenesis
.

The
chemoprotective
activity
of
DHEA
is
attributed
to
its
inhibitory
potential
for
the
expression
of
CYP1A
enzymes
,
which
are
highly
responsible
for
metabolic
activation
of
several
mutagenic
and
carcinogenic
chemicals
.

The
present
work
investigated
whether
the
chemoprevention
by
DHEA
was
due
to
diminished
transcriptional
activation
of
CYP1A
genes
or
to
the
post-transcriptional
modulation
of
CYP1A
expression
.

In
primary
human
hepatocytes
,
DHEA
diminished
the
increase
in
CYP1A
activities
(
7-ethoxyresorufin
O-dealkylation
and
phenacetin
O-dealkylation
)
and
in
CYP1A2
mRNA
level
induced
by
3-methylcholanthrene
,
but
did
not
alter
the
amount
of
CYP1A1
and
CYP1B1
mRNA
.

The
androgen
receptor
seemed
to
be
involved
in
DHEA-mediated
diminishment
of
CYP1A2
induction
,
which
was
attenuated
in
the
presence
of
bicalutamide
,
the
androgen
receptor
antagonist
.

The
potential
role
of
the
glucocorticoid
receptor
and
estrogen
receptor
in
DHEA-mediated
decrease
in
CYP1A2
induction
was
excluded
.

The
developed
computational
model
of
CYP1A2
induction
kinetics
and
CYP1A2
mRNA
degradation
proposed
that
a
post-transcriptional
mechanism
was
likely
to
be
the
primary
mechanism
of
the
DHEA-mediated
diminishment
of
CYP1A2
induction
.

The
hypothesis
was
confirmed
by
the
results
of
actinomycin
D-chase
experiments
in
MCF-7
and
LNCaP
cells
,
displaying
that
the
degradation
rates
of
CYP1A2
mRNA
were
significantly
higher
in
the
cells
exposed
to
DHEA
.

The
novel
findings
on
DHEA-mediated
modulation
of
CYP1A2
mRNA
stability
may
account
for
the
beneficial
effects
of
DHEA
by
decreasing
the
metabolic
activation
of
pro-carcinogenic
compounds

RATIONALE
:
A
common
polymorphism
(
5HTTLPR
)
within
the
promoter
region
of
the
serotonin
transporter
gene
(
LSC6A4
)
has
been
shown
to
influence
response
time
as
well
as
overall
response
to
selective
serotonin
reuptake
inhibitors
(
SSRIs
)
in
subjects
with
major
depressive
disorder
.

We
hypothesized
that
a
similar
effect
in
response
time
to
sertraline
would
be
observed
and
that
no
effect
on
response
time
would
be
seen
in
a
placebo
arm
.

OBJECTIVES
:
We
tested
the
hypothesis
that
subjects
homozygous
for
the
long
allele
at
the
5HTTLPR
polymorphism
would
respond
more
rapidly
to
sertraline
than
subjects
carrying
one
or
two
copies
of
the
short
allele
.

METHODS
:
HAM-D
and
CGI-I
responses
to
sertraline
and
placebo
were
measured
weekly
in
the
context
of
an
8-week
,
placebo-controlled
study
in
elderly
depressed
subjects
.

Genotyping
of
the
5HTTLPR
polymorphism
was
performed
to
test
for
correlations
with
response
at
each
week
in
the
sertraline
and
placebo
groups
(
n
=
206
)
.

RESULTS
:
Subjects
homozygous
for
the
long
allele
of
5HTTLPR
showed
a
significant
increase
in
response
at
week
1
and
week
2
,
as
assessed
by
the
CGI-I
scale
compared
with
subjects
carrying
one
or
two
copies
of
the
short
allele
(
P
=
0
.
01
at
both
weeks
)
.

No
significant
difference
was
observed
in
the
placebo
group
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
These
results
suggest
that
genetic
variation
in
the
serotonin
transporter
gene
effects
the
response
time
to
sertraline
and
provides
complementing
evidence
to
previous
reports
that
this
polymorphism
affects
response
time
to
other
SSRIs
.
A
large
amount
of
the
data
gathered
in
the
last
50
years
support
the
hypothesis
that
alterations
of
the
serotonin
(
5-HT
)
neurotransmission
play
a
crucial
role
in
the
pathophysiology
of
not
only
major
depression
(
MD
)
,
but
also
of
different
neuropsychiatric
disorders
.

Research
in
this
field
has
been
substantially
promoted
by
the
evidence
that
the
reuptake
protein
(
SERT
)
,
present
in
presynaptic
neurons
,
is
a
key
element
in
terminating
the
activity
of
the
neurotransmitter
in
the
synaptic
cleft
.

For
this
reason
,
it
was
specifically
targeted
for
the
development
of
second-generation
antidepressants
,
in
particular
of
selective
5-HT
reuptake
inhibitors
(
SSRIs
)
,
with
the
aim
of
increasing
the
intrasynaptic
5-HT
concentrations
.

Moreover
,
since
a
lot
of
studies
showed
that
circulating
platelets
and
,
more
recently
,
lymphocytes
possess
functional
SERT
proteins
,
they
have
been
widely
used
as
peripheral
mirrors
of
the
same
structures
located
in
the
central
nervous
system
.

The
presence
of
functional
SERT
in
blood
cells
suggests
strict
relationships
between
the
nervous
and
the
immune
system
that
need
to
be
better
clarified
in
MD
,
as
well
as
the
possibility
of
reciprocal
modulation
of
the
two
systems
by
different
drugs
.

This
paper
aims
to
review
briefly
the
literature
on
the
5-HT
hypothesis
of
depression
with
a
major
focus
on
the
possible
role
of
SERT
in
this
disorder
,
while
highlighting
how
recent
data
are
more
oriented
on
dimensional
rather
than
nosological
involvement
of
this
structure
in
different
conditions
spanning
from
normality
to
pathology
.
Beta-adrenoceptor
antagonists
(
"beta-blockers"
)
are
one
of
the
most
widely
used
classes
of
drugs
in
cardiovascular
medicine
(
hypertension
,
ischaemic
heart
disease
and
increasingly
in
heart
failure
)
as
well
as
in
the
management
of
anxiety
,
migraine
and
glaucoma
.

Where
known
,
the
mode
of
action
in
cardiovascular
disease
is
from
antagonism
of
endogenous
catecholamine
responses
in
the
heart
(
mainly
at
beta1-adrenoceptors
)
,
while
the
worrisome
side
effects
of
bronchospasm
result
from
airway
beta2-adrenoceptor
blockade
.

The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
determine
the
selectivity
of
beta-antagonists
for
the

the
human
beta1-
,
beta2-
or
the
beta3-adrenoceptor
in
order
to
determine
the
affinity
of
ligands
for
each
receptor
subtype
in
the
same
cell
background
.

In
this
study
,
the
selectivity
of
well-known
subtype-selective
ligands
was
clearly
demonstrated
:
thus
,
the
selective
beta1
antagonist
CGP
20712A
was
501-fold
selective
over
beta2
and
4169-fold
selective
over
beta3;
the
beta2-selective
antagonist
ICI
118551
was
550-
and
661-fold
selective
over
beta1
and
beta3
,
respectively
,
and
the
selective
beta3
compound
CL
316243
was
10-fold
selective
over
beta2
and
more
than
129-fold
selective
over
beta1
.

Those
beta2-adrenoceptor
agonists
used
clinically
for
the
treatment
of
asthma
and
COPD
were
beta2
selective
:
29-
,
61-
and
2818-fold
for
salbutamol
,
terbutaline
and
salmeterol
over
beta1
,
respectively
.

There
was
little
difference
in
the
affinity
of
these
ligands
between
beta1
and
beta3
adrenoceptors
.

The
clinically
used
beta-antagonists
studied
ranged
from
bisoprolol
(
14-fold
beta1-selective
)
to
timolol
(
26-fold
beta2-selective
)
.

However
,
the
majority
showed
little
selectivity
for
the
beta1-
over
the
beta2-adrenoceptor
,
with
many
actually
being
more
beta2-selective
.

This
study
shows
that
the
beta1
/
beta2
selectivity
of
most
clinically
used
beta-blockers
is
poor
in
intact
cells
,
and
that
some
compounds
that
are
traditionally
classed
as
"beta1-selective"
actually
have
higher
affinity
for
the
beta2-adrenoceptor
.

There
is
therefore
considerable
potential
for
developing
more
selective
beta-antagonists
for
clinical
use
and
thereby
reducing
the
side-effect
profile
of
beta-blockers
.

Buckwheat
(
Fagopyrum

)
groats
contain
the
iminosugar
D-fagomine
as
a
minor
component
that
might
contribute
to
the
alleged
health
benefits
of
this
pseudo-cereal
.

This
study
presents
analysis
of
D-fagomine
in
buckwheat-based
foodstuffs
by
liquid

coupled
to
mass
spectrometry
and
an
estimation
of
its
presence
in
the
human
diet
based
on
a
published
population-based
cross-sectional
nutrition
survey
.

D-fagomine
is
present
in
common
buckwheat-based
foodstuffs
in
amounts
ranging
from
1
to
25
mg
/
kg
or
mg
/
L
,
it
is
stable
during
boiling
,
baking
,
frying
and
fermentation
,
and
it
is
biosynthesised
upon
sprouting
.

The
estimated
total
intake
of
D-fagomine
resulting
from
a
diet
that
includes
such
foodstuffs
would
be
between
3
and
17
mg
per
day
(
mean
for
both
genders;
range
from
P5
to
P95
)
.

A
diet
rich
in
buckwheat
products
would
provide
a
daily
amount
of
D-fagomine
that
may
in
part
explain
the
beneficial
properties
traditionally
attributed
to
buckwheat
consumption

OBJECTIVE
:
Angiotensin
II-receptor
blockers
are
an
established
class
of
antihypertensive
agents
,
but
the
differences
between
individual
members
of
the
class
are
largely
unknown
.

The
present
study
employed
an
animal
model
to
demonstrate
angiotensin
II-receptor
blocker-specific
effects
and
to
quantify
these
differences
by
comparing
two
common
agents
,
losartan
and
valsartan
.

METHODS
:
We
measured
the
effects
on
angiotensin
II
AT2-receptor-mediated
renal
cGMP
by
microdialysis
in
the
outer
renal
cortex
in
conscious
normotensive
,
sodium-depleted
,
4-week-old
Sprague-Dawley
rats
.

Rats
(
n
=
8
)
were
given
equimolar
and
equidepressor
doses
of
losartan
(
0
.
02
mmol
/
kg
)
or
valsartan
(
0
.
02
mmol
/
kg
)
either
intravenously
or
orally
.

Time
was
allowed
for
the
conversion
of
losartan
into
its
active
metabolite
,
EXP
3174
.

RESULTS
:
Both
drugs
had
equal
effects
on
blood
pressure
.

There
were
significantly
greater
increases
in
cGMP
levels
after
administration
of
valsartan
than
of
losartan
with
both
routes
of
administration
.

Intravenous
administration
of
valsartan
led
to
a
69
.
1%
increase
in
cGMP
,
versus
a
10
.
3%
increase
with
losartan
.

Five
hours
after
oral
administration
of
valsartan
,
a
48%
increase
in
cGMP
was
observed
versus
a
10
.
9%
increase
with
losartan
.

The
increase
after
oral
administration
of
valsartan
was
sustained
8
h
after
administration
,
whereas
the
effect
of
losartan
was
not
sustained
.

The
effects
of
losartan
and
valsartan
on
cGMP
were
completely
inhibited
by
AT2-receptor
blockade
.

CONCLUSION
:
The
results
indicate
that
AT1-receptor
blockade
with
valsartan
influences
AT2-receptor-mediated
angiotensin
II
responses
to
a
greater
extent
than
with
losartan
,
as
quantified
by
renal

INTRODUCTION
:
The
recently
approved
angiotensin
II
(
Ang
II
)
type
1
(
AT1
)
receptor
blocker
(
ARB
)
azilsartan
strongly
reduces
blood
pressure
(
BP
)
in
patients
with
hypertension
.

We
previously
reported
that
azilsartan
showed
unique
binding
behavior
to
the
AT1
receptor
because
of
its
5-oxo-1
,
2
,
4-oxadiazole
moiety
.

However
,
the
ability
of
azilsartan
to
block
Ang
II-dependent
AT1
receptor
activation
is
not
yet
clear
.

MATERIALS
AND
METHODS
:
Azilsartan
and
a
derivative
of
azilsartan
(
azilsartan-7H
)
that
lacks
a
carboxyl
group
at
the
benzimidazole
ring
were
used
.

Ang
II-induced
inositol
phosphate
(
IP
)
production
and
extracellular
signal-regulated
kinase
(
ERK
)
activation
were
analyzed
in
a
cell-based
wash-out
assay
.

RESULTS
:
Azilsartan
,
but
not
azilsartan-7H
,
completely
blocked
Ang
II-induced
IP
production
and
ERK
activation
.

Our
previous
report
demonstrated
that
azilsartan
mainly
interacts
with
Tyr
(
113
)
,
Lys
(
199
)
,
and
Gln
(
257
)
in
the
AT1
receptor
.

The
interactions
between
azilsartan
and
Tyr
(
113
)
and
Gln
(
257
)
,
but
not
Lys
(
199
)
,
were
critical
for
blocking
Ang
II-induced
IP
production
and
ERK
activation
after
wash-out
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
Although
our
findings
regarding
the
molecule-specific
effects
of
azilsartan
are
based
on
basic
research
,
they
may
lead
to
an
exciting
insight
into
the
mechanism
of
azilsartan
.
There
is
an
increasing
body
of
evidence
demonstrating
that
growth
factor
networks
are
highly
interactive
with
oestrogen
receptor
(
ER
)
signalling
in
the
control
of
breast
cancer
growth
.

As
such
,
tumour
responses
to
anti-
hormones
are
likely
to
be
a
composite
of
the
ER
and
growth
factor
inhibitory
activity
of
these
agents
.

The
current
article
examines
the
modulation
of
growth
factor
networks
during
endocrine
response
,
and
presents
in
vitro
and
clinical
evidence
that
epidermal
growth
factor
receptor
signalling
,
maintained
in
either
an
ER-dependent
or
-independent
manner
,
is
critical
to
anti-
hormonal-resistant
breast
cancer
cell
growth
.

The
considerable
potential
of
the
epidermal
growth
factor
receptor-selective
tyrosine
kinase
inhibitor
,
ZD
1839
(
Iressa;
AstraZeneca
)
to
efficiently
treat
,
and
perhaps
even
prevent
,
endocrine-resistant
breast
cancer
is
highlighted
.
The
long
QT-related
arrhythmia
torsades
de
pointes
(
TdP
)
can
arise
with
mutations
in
HERG
and
during
treatment
with
drugs
that
block
cardiac
I
Kr
,
the
current
encoded
by
HERG
.

Multiple
test
systems
have
been
used
to
assess
drug
block
of
I
Kr
.

This
study
evaluated
the
I
Kr
blocking
potency
of
a
series
of
antiarrhythmics
associated
with
a
range
of
clinical
risks
of
TdP
in
two
such
systems
:
mouse
AT-1
cells
(
in
which
I
Kr
is
the
major
repolarizing
current
)
and
Ltk
cells
transiently
transfected
with
HERG
(
n
=
4-10
cells
per
drug
)
.

For
each
compound
,
the
concentration
required
to
produce
50%
block
of
I
Kr
or
HERG
tail
currents
(
IC
50
)
was
determined
.

There
was
an
excellent
correlation
(
r
=
0
.
98
,
p
<
10
-5
)
between
values
obtained
in
the
two
systems
.

However
,
the
relation
between
the
liability
of
a
drug
to
cause
TdP
appeared
dissociated
from
I
Kr
blocking
potency
.

Quinidine
,
dofetilide
,
ibutilide
,
procainamide
,
and
disopyramide
are
all
associated
with
TdP
,
but
only
the
first
three
were
potent
blockers
(
IC
50
<
or
=
1
microM
)
,
whereas
procainamide
and
disopyramide
were
not
(
IC
50
>
50
microM
)
.

Conversely
,
verapamil
and
amiodarone
,
drugs
not
associated
with
TdP
,
were
also
blockers
(
IC
50
<
or
=
1
microM
)
.

We
conclude
that
I
Kr
blocking
potency
can
be
readily
assessed
in
either
AT-1
cells
or
systems
in
which
HERG
is
heterologously
expressed
.

However
,
not
all
drugs
causing
TdP
are
potent
I
Kr
blockers
,
and
I
Kr
block
is
not
necessarily
associated
with
TdP
.

Other
properties
of
these
drugs
,
therefore
,
contribute
to
their
propensity
to
cause
TdP
.

A
series
of
phosphorylated
flavonoids
were
synthesized
and
investigated
in
vitro
as
inhibitors
of
pancreatic
cholesterol
esterase
(
CEase
)
and
acetylcholinesterase
(
AChE
)
.

The
results
showed
that
most
of
the
synthesized
compounds
exhibited
nanomolar
potency
against
CEase
,
much
better
than
the
parent
flavonoids
.

Furthermore
,
these
phosphorylated
flavonoids
demonstrated
good
to
high
selectivity
for
CEase
over
AChE
,
which
only
showed
micromolar
potency
inhibition
of
AChE
.

The
most
selective
and
potent
inhibitor
of
CEase
(
3e
)
had
IC50
value
of
0
.
72
nM
and
11800-fold
selectivity
for
CEase
over
AChE
.

The
structure-activity
relationships
revealed
that
the
free
hydroxyl
group
at
position
5
and
phosphate
group
at
position
7
of
the
phosphorylated
flavonoids
are
favorable
to
the
inhibition
of
CEase
.

The
inhibition
mechanism
and
kinetic
characterization
studies
indicated
that
they
are
irreversible
competitive
inhibitors
of
CEase
.
In
this
study
seven
published
methods
of
extraction
of
skin
free
and
bound
volatile
compounds
have
been
compared
.

The
free

bound
volatiles
were
separated
by
solid
phase
extraction
(
SPE
)
and
then
analysed
by
gas
chromatography
coupled
with
mass
spectrometry
(
GC-MS
)
.

The
results
showed
that
the
extraction
of
volatile
compounds
from
grapes
is
highly
affected
by
extraction
solution
features
.

The
solution
at
pH
3
.
2
and
0%
ethanol
resulted
the
most
effective
as
it
led
to
the
extraction
of
a
higher
number
and
amount
of
free
and
glycosilated
volatile
compounds
.

The
selected
extraction
method
of
grape
skin
and
the
process
of
pulp
juice
were
validated
for
quantitative
determination
of
a
wide
range
of
grape
aroma
compounds
.

A
total
of
37
free
and
bound
grape
aroma
compounds
were
quantified
by
GC-MS
in
selective

modality
(

Among
them
,
26

The
cDNA
encoding

from
human

has
been
mutated
at
five
positions
by
in

.

We
have
changed
three
acidic
amino
acids
and
two
arginine
residues
that
are
conserved
in
the
sequence
of
mammalian
PH-20
polypeptides
as
well
as
in
the
hyaluronidases
from
bee
and
hornet
venom
.

Of
the
former
,
the
mutants
[
Gln113
]
PH-20
and
[
Gln249
]
PH-20
had
no
detectable
enzymatic
activity;
the
mutant
[
Asn111
]
PH-20
had
about
3%
activity
.

The
mutant
[
Thr252
]
PH-20
was
also
inactive
,
while
[
Gly176
]
PH-20
had
only
about
1%
activity
.

This
indicates
that
the
PH-20
hyaluronidases
,
like
numerous
enzymes
that
hydrolyze
glycosidic
bonds
,
have
acidic
amino
acids
in
their
active

Moreover

for
the

the

,
the

arginine

appear
to
be
essential

Expression

was

contained
higher
levels
of
all
compounds
,
except
the
enolic
phenylpyruvic
acid-2-O-glucoside

Both

increased

Compared
to
FRE
,
GRE
was
more
effective
at
increasing

ATP

At
a
mechanistic
level
both
extracts
down-regulated
PKC

which
is
associated
with
palmitate-induced

Furthermore
,
the

increased

of
key
regulatory
proteins
(
AKT

AMPK
)
involved
in
insulin-dependent

Protein
levels
of
the

involved
in

via
these

were
also
increased

Inhibition

Suppression

:
assessment
with
24-hour
urinary
steroid
hormone
profiles--a
review
of
five
cases
.
ACTH
has
been
shown
to
stimulate
androgen
production
by
the
fetal
/
neonatal
mouse
testis
through
the
melanocortin
type
2
receptor
(
MC2R
)
.

This
study
was
designed
to
localize
the
expression
of
MC2R
in
the
neonatal
mouse
testis
and
characterize
the
effects
of
ACTH
on
testicular
androgen
production
.

Using
immunohistochemistry
,
MC2R
was
localized
to
the
fetal-type
Leydig
cell
population
of
the
neonatal
testis
.

ACTH
caused
a
time-dependent
increase
in
cyclic
AMP
(
cAMP
)
and
testosterone
production
by
isolated
cells
with
an
increase
in
cAMP
apparent
in
<
3
min
.

There
was
no
additive
effect
of
maximally
stimulating
doses
of
ACTH
and
human
chorionic
gonadotropin
(
hCG
)
.

Androgen
production
in
response
to
ACTH
and
hCG
was
reduced
by
UO126
and
dexamethasone
,
which
are
the
inhibitors
of
ERK1
/
2
and
phospholipase
A2
respectively
.

Expression
of
mRNA
encoding
StAR
was
increased
fourfold
by
both
ACTH
and
hCG
,
although
expression
of
mRNA
encoding
for
steroidogenic
enzymes
was
not
markedly
affected
.

The
potency
of
N-terminal
fragments
of
ACTH
to
stimulate
androgen
production
was
similar
to
that
seen
previously
in
the
adrenal
.

Data
indicate
that
both
LH
and
ACTH
,
acting
through
their
respective
receptors
,
stimulate
steroidogenesis

These

the

The
human
ortholog
HM74a
is
also
a
nicotinic
acid
receptor
and
likely
has
a
similar
role
in
anti-lipolysis
.

Endogenous
levels
of
nicotinic
acid
are
too
low
to
significantly
impact
receptor
activity
,
hence
the
natural
ligands
(
s
)
of
HM74a
/
PUMA-G
remain
to
be
elucidated
.

Here
we
show
that
the
fatty
acid-derived
ketone
body
(
D
)
-beta-hydroxybutyrate
(
(
D
)
-beta-OHB
)
specifically
activates
PUMA-G
/
HM74a
at
concentrations
observed
in
serum
during
fasting
.

Like
nicotinic
acid
,
(
D
)
-beta-OHB
inhibits
mouse
adipocyte
lipolysis
in
a
PUMA-G-dependent
manner
and
is
thus
the
first
endogenous
ligand
described
for
this
orphan
receptor
.

These
findings
suggests
a
homeostatic
mechanism
for
surviving
starvation
in
which
(
D
)
-beta-OHB
negatively
regulates
its
own
production
,
thereby
preventing
ketoacidosis
and
promoting
efficient

of

The
mechanisms
that
can
account
for
the
remarkable
mammary
carcinogenicity
of
the
environmental
pollutant
6-nitrochrysene
(
6-NC
)
in
the
rat
remain
elusive
.

In
our
previous
studies
,
we
identified
several
6-NC-derived
DNA
adducts
in
the
rat
mammary
gland;
one
major
adduct
was
derived
from
(
±
)
-trans-1
,
2-dihydroxy-1
,
2-dihydro-6-nitrochrysene
(
1
,
2-DHD-6-NC
)
.

In
the
present
study
,
we
resolved
the
racemic
(

,
2-DHD-6-NC
into
(

(

2-DHD-6-NC
and
compared
their
in

mutagenicity
and
carcinogenicity
in
the
mammary
glands
of
female
transgenic

BigBlue
F344
×

)
F1
rats
harboring

and
Sprague-Dawley
rats
,
respectively
.

Both
[

,
R
]
-
and
[
S
,
S
]
-isomers
exerted
similar
mutagenicity
and
carcinogenicity
but
were
less
potent
than
6-NC
.

Additional
in
vivo
and
in
vitro
studies
were
then
performed
to
explore
possible
mechanisms
that
can
explain
the
higher
potency
of
6-NC
than
1
,
2-DHD-6-NC
.

Using
ELISA
,
we
found
that
neither
6-NC
nor
1
,
2-DHD-6-NC
increased
the
levels
of
several
inflammatory
cytokines
in
plasma
obtained
from
rats
24
h
after
treatment
.

In
MCF-7
cells
,
as
determined
by
immunoblotting
,
the
effects
of
6-NC
and
1
,
2-DHD-6-NC
on
protein
expression
(
p53
,
Akt
,
p38
,
JNK
,
c-myc
,
bcl-2
,
PCNA
,
and
ERβ
)
were
comparable;
however
,
the
expressions
of
AhR
and
ERα
proteins
were
decreased
by
6-NC
but
not
1
,
2-DHD-6-NC
.

The
expression
of
both
receptors
was
decreased
in
mammary
tissues
of
rats
treated
with
6-NC
.

Our
findings
suggest
that
the
differential
effects
of
6-NC
and
1
,
2-DHD-6-NC
on
AhR
and
ERα
could
potentially
account
for
the
higher
carcinogenicity
of
6-NC
in
the
rat
mammary
gland
.
Evidence
for
a
role
of
dopamine
and
serotonin
in
the
control
of
ethanol
intake
in
animals
suggests
that
monoamine

(
MAO
)
inhibitors
,
which
increase
the
synaptic
availability
of
serotonin
and
dopamine
by
blocking
their
metabolism
,
might
have
efficacy
in
the
treatment
of
alcohol
dependence
.

The
aim
of
the
present
study
was
,
therefore
,
to
evaluate
several
MAO
inhibitors
for
their
capacity
to
affect
ethanol
self-administration
in
rats
trained
to
self-administer
ethanol
(
10%

The

phenelzine
(
3-10
mg

)
,
tranylcypromine
(
1-3
mg

)
,
and
nialamide
(
30
mg
/

)
,
decreased
rates
of
responding
maintained
by
ethanol
reinforcement
.

The
reversible
MAO-A
inhibitor
,
befloxatone
(
0

3-3
mg

kg
)
,
and
the
irreversible
MAO-A
inhibitor
,
clorgyline
(
10-30
mg
/
kg
)
,
also
reduced
ethanol
self-administration
.

However
,
befloxatone-induced
effects
leveled
off
at
a
50%
decrease
.

The
irreversible
MAO-B
inhibitors
,
pargyline
(
30
mg
/
kg
)
and
l-deprenyl
(
3-10
mg

)
also
decreased
responding
maintained
by
ethanol
reinforcement;
these
results
are
consistent
with
previous
findings
that
both
drugs
decreased
ethanol
intake
in
mice
.

In
conclusion
,
the
present
results
showing
that
several
MAO
inhibitors
decreased
ethanol
self-administration
in
rats
are
consistent
with
previous
findings
that

The
ability
of
salmeterol
,
administered

to
protect

was
short-acting

,
which
contrasts
with
its
long-acting
nature
when
given
to

These
results
indicate
that
chronic
treatment
of
rats
with
salmeterol
results
in
heterologous
desensitization
of
pulmonary
G

-coupled
receptors
.

In
light
of
previous
data
obtained
in
rats
treated
chronically
with
salbutamol
,
we
propose
that
a
primary
mechanism
responsible
for
this
effect
is
a
reduction
in
membrane-associated
G
(
s
alpha
)
.

The
short-acting
nature
of
salmeterol
,
when
administered
systemically
,
and
the
reduction
in
beta-adrenoceptor
number
may
be
due
to
metabolism
to
a
biologically-active

short-acting
and
non-selective
beta-adrenoceptor
agonist

Few
studies
have
addressed
the
delivery
of
lipoprotein-derived

to
the
adrenals
for
steroid

While
there
is
evidence
against
a
role
for
low-density

(
LDL
)
,
it
is
unresolved
whether
high
density
lipoprotein
(
HDL
)
contributes
to
adrenal
steroidogenesis
.

To
study
this
,
steroid

.

In
all

not
reveal
differences

In
conclusion

this

that
basal

stimulated
corticosteroid
metabolism
is
attenuated
in
subjects

Sepracor
in
the
US
is
developing
arformoterol
[
R

R-formoterol
]
,
a
single
isomer
form
of
the
beta
(
2
)
-adrenoceptor
agonist
formoterol
[
eformoterol
]
.

This
isomer
contains
two
chiral
centres
and
is
being
developed
as
an
inhaled
preparation
for
the
treatment
of
respiratory
disorders
.

Sepracor
believes
that
arformoterol
has
the
potential
to
be
a
once-daily
therapy
with
a
rapid
onset
of
action
and
a
duration
of
effect
exceeding
12
hours
.

In
1995
,
Sepracor
acquired
New
England
Pharmaceuticals
,
a
manufacturer
of
metered-dose
and
dry
powder
inhalers
,
for
the
purpose
of
preparing
formulations
of
levosalbutamol
and
arformoterol
.

Phase
II
dose-ranging
clinical
studies
of
arformoterol
as
a
longer-acting
,
complementary
bronchodilator
were
completed
successfully
in
the
fourth
quarter
of
2000
.

Phase
III
trials
of
arformoterol
began
in
September
2001
.

The
indications
for
the
drug
appeared
to
be
asthma
and
chronic
obstructive
pulmonary
disease
(
COPD
)
.

However
,
an
update
of
the
pharmaceutical
product
information
on
the
Sepracor
website
in
September
2003
listed
COPD
maintenance
therapy
as
the
only
indication
for
arformoterol
.

In
October
2002
,
Sepracor
stated
that
two
pivotal
phase
III
studies
were
ongoing
in
1600
patients
.

Sepracor
estimates
that
its
NDA
submission
for
arformoterol
,
which
is
projected
for
the
first
half
of
2004
,
will
include
approximately
3000
adult
subjects
.

Sepracor
stated
in
July
2003
that
it
had
completed
more
than
100
preclinical
studies
and
initiated
or
completed
15
clinical
studies
for
arformoterol
inhalation
solution
for
the
treatment
of
bronchospasm
in
patients
with
COPD
.

In
addition
,
Sepracor
stated
that
the
two
pivotal
phase
III
studies
in
1600
patients
were
still
progressing
.

In
1995
,
European
patents
were
granted
to
Sepracor
for
the
use
of
arformoterol
in
the
treatment
of
asthma
,
and
the
US
patent

chosen

provided
the

The

Dofetilide
,
a

,
is
a
potent
class

antiarrhythmic
drug
.

Like
other
members
of
this
class
of
K

channel
blockers
,
the
sites
in
the
channel
to
which
the
drug
binds
are
unknown
,
although
high
and
low
affinity
binding
has
been
reported
in

.

The
most
sensitive
K

target
for
dofetilide
seems
to
be
IKr
,
the
rapid
component
of
the

.

However
,
block
of
other
K

occurs
at
higher
concentrations
and
is
of
special
interest
in

to
toxicity
.

Recently
,
we
have
demonstrated
that
hIRK

(
IRK
)
isolated
from
human

expressed
heterologously
in

,
is

by

.

We
report
the
localization
of
a

that
is
critical
for

in

.

We
used
chimeric
constructs
between
hIRK
and
ROMK1
,
a

that
is

.

Substitution
of
hIRK-M2
,
the

of
IRKs
,
with
ROMK1-M2
increased
unblocking
of

by
10-20-fold
in
hIRK
.

Site-directed

further
pinpointed
the
effects
to
a

(
I177
)
in

.

A

The

strongly
inhibited

Glutamine

were
efficiently
translocated
from

Cysteine

Arsenic
can
induce
reactive
oxygen
species
(
ROS
)
leading
to
oxidative
stress
and
carcinogenesis
.

Bladder
is
one
of
the
major
target
organs
of
arsenic
,
and
cyclooxygenase-2
(
COX-2
)
may
play
an
important
role
in
arsenic-induced
bladder
cancer
.

However
,
the
mechanism
by
which
arsenic
induces
COX-2
in
bladder
cells
remains
unclear
.

This
study
aimed
at
investigating
arsenic-mediated
intracellular
redox
status
and
signaling
cascades
leading
to
COX-2
induction
in
human
uroepithelial
cells
(
SV-HUC-1
)
.

SV-HUC-1
cells
were
exposed
to
sodium
arsenite
and
COX-2
expression
,
mitogen-activated
protein
kinase
(
MAPK
)
phosphorylation
,
glutathione
(
GSH
)
levels
,
ROS
induction
and
Nrf2
expression
were
quantified
.

Our
results
demonstrate
that
arsenite
(
1-10
μM
)
elevates
COX-2
expression
,
GSH
levels
,
ROS
and
Nrf2
expression
.

Arsenite
treatment
for
24h
stimulates
phosphorylation
of
ERK
and
p38
,
but
not
JNK
in
SV-HUC-1
cells
.

Induction
of
Cox-2
mRNA
levels
by
arsenite
was
attenuated
by
inhibitors
of
ERK
,
p38
and
JNK
.

Arsenite-induced
ROS
generation
and
COX-2
expression
were
significantly
attenuated
by
treatment
with
melatonin
(
a
ROS
scavenger
)
,
but
enhanced
by
DL-buthionine-

S
,

)
-sulfoximine

,
an
inhibitor
of
gamma-glutamylcysteine
synthetase
(
γ-GCS
)
resulting
in
lower
GSH
and
increased
ROS
levels
)
.

These
data
indicate
that
arsenite
promotes
an
induction
of
ROS
,
which
results
in
an
induction
of
COX-2
expression
through
activation
of
the
MAPK

.
Due
to
the
increased
prevalence
of
bacterial
strains
that
are
resistant
to
existing
antibiotics
,
there
is
an
urgent
need
for
new
antibacterial
strategies
.

Bacterial
glycans
are
an
attractive
target
for
new
treatments
,
as
they
are
frequently
linked
to
pathogenesis
and
contain
distinctive
structures
that
are
absent
in
humans
.

We
set
out
to
develop
a
novel
targeting
strategy
based
on
surface
glycans
present
on
the
gastric
pathogen
Helicobacter
pylori
(
Hp
)
.

In
this
study
,
metabolic
labeling
of
bacterial
glycans
with
an
azide-containing
sugar
allowed
selective
delivery
of
immune
stimulants
to
azide-covered
Hp
.

We
established
that
Hp's
surface
glycans
are
labeled
by
treatment
with
the
metabolic
substrate
peracetylated
N-azidoacetylglucosamine
(
Ac4
GlcNAz
)
.

By
contrast
,
mammalian
cells
treated
with
Ac4
GlcNAz
exhibited
no
incorporation
of
the
chemical
label
within
extracellular
glycans
.

We
further
demonstrated
that
the
Staudinger
ligation
between
azides
and
phosphines
proceeds
under
acidic
conditions
with
only
a
small
loss
of
efficiency
.

We
then
targeted
azide-covered
Hp
with
phosphines
conjugated
to
the
immune
stimulant
2
,
4-dinitrophenyl
(
DNP
)
,
a
compound
capable
of
directing
a
host
immune
response
against
these
cells
.

Finally
,
we
report
that
immune
effector
cells
catalyze
selective
damage
in
vitro
to
DNP-covered
Hp
in
the
presence
of
anti-DNP
antibodies
.

The
technology
reported
herein
represents
a
novel
strategy
to
target
Hp
based
on
its
glycans

The
enzyme
,
10-formyltetrahydrofolate
dehydrogenase
(
FDH
)
,
converts
10-formyltetrahydrofolate
(
10-formyl-THF
)
to
tetrahydrofolate
in
an
NADP
(
+
)
-dependent
dehydrogenase
reaction
or
an
NADP
(
+
)
-independent
hydrolase
reaction
.

The
hydrolase
reaction
occurs
in
a
310-amino
acid
long
amino-terminal
domain
of
FDH
(
N
(
t
)
-FDH
)
,
whereas
the
dehydrogenase
reaction
requires
the
full-length
enzyme
.

The
amino-terminal
domain
of
FDH
shares
some
sequence
identity
with
several
other
enzymes
utilizing
10-formyl-THF
as
a
substrate
.

These
enzymes
have
two
strictly
conserved
residues
,
aspartate
and
histidine
,
in
the
putative
catalytic
center
.

We
have
shown
recently
that
the
conserved
aspartate
is
involved
in
FDH
catalysis
.

In
the
present
work
we
studied
the
role
of
the
conserved
histidine
,
His
(
106
)
,
in
FDH
function
.

Site-directed
mutagenesis
experiments
showed
that
replacement
of
the
histidine
with
alanine
,
asparagine
,
aspartate
,
glutamate
,
glutamine
,
or
arginine
in
N
(
t
)
-FDH
resulted
in
expression
of
insoluble
proteins
.

Replacement
of
the
histidine
with
another
positively
charged
residue
,
lysine
,
produced
a
soluble
mutant
with
no
hydrolase
activity
.

The
insoluble
mutants
refolded
from
inclusion
bodies
adopted
a
conformation
inherent
to
the
wild-type
N
(
t
)
-FDH
,
but
they
did
not
exhibit
any
hydrolase
activity
.

Substitution
of
alanine
for
three
non-conserved
histidines
located
close
to
the
conserved
one
did
not
reveal
any
significant
changes
in
the
hydrolase
activity
of
N
(
t
)
-FDH
.

Expressed
full-length
FDH
with
the
substitution
of
lysine
for
the
His
(
106
)
completely
lost
both
the
hydrolase
and
dehydrogenase
activities
.

Thus
,
our
study
showed
that
His
(
106
)
,
besides
being
an
important
structural
residue
,
is
also
directly
involved
in
both
the
hydrolase
and
dehydrogenase
mechanisms
of
FDH
.

Modeling
of
the
putative
hydrolase
catalytic
center
/
folate-binding
site
suggested
that
the
catalytic
residues
,
aspartate
and
histidine
,
are
unlikely
to
be
adjacent
to
the
catalytic
cysteine
in
the
aldehyde
dehydrogenase
catalytic
center
.

We
hypothesize
that
10-formyl-THF
dehydrogenase
reaction
is
not
an
independent
reaction
but
is
a
combination
of
hydrolase
and
aldehyde
dehydrogenase
reactions
.
Serine
(
Ser
)
biosynthesis
in
C
(

)
plants
can
occur
via
several
pathways
.

One
major
route
involves
the
tetrahydrofolate
(
THF
)
-dependent
activities
of
the
glycine
decarboxylase
complex
(
GDC
,
EC
2
.

.

.
10
)
and
serine
hydroxymethyltransferase
(
SHMT
,
EC
2
.
1
.
2
.
1
)
with
glycine
(
Gly
)
as
one-carbon
(
1-C
)
source
.

An
alternative
THF-dependent
pathway
involves
the
C1-THF
synthase
/
SHMT
activities
with
formate
as
1-C
source
.

Here
,
we
have
investigated
aspects
of
the
regulation
of
these
two
folate-mediated
pathways
in
Arabidopsis
thaliana
(
L
.

)
Heynh
.

Columbia
using
two
approaches
.

Firstly
,
transgenic
plants
overexpressing
formate
dehydrogenase
(
FDH
,
EC
1
.
2
.
1
.
2
)
were
used
to
continue
our
previous
studies
on
the
function
of
FDH
in
formate
metabolism
.

The
formate
pool
size
was
approximately
73
nmol
(
g
FW
)
(
-1
)
in
wild
type
(
WT
)
Arabidopsis
plants;
three
independent
transgenic
lines
had
similar-sized
pools
of
formate
.

Transgenic
plants
produced
more
(
13
)
CO
(
2
)
from
supplied
[
(
13
)
C
]
formate
than
did
WT
plants
but
were
not
significantly
different
from
WT
plants
in
their
synthesis
of
Ser
.

We
concluded
that
FDH
has
no
direct
role
in
the
regulation
of
the
above
two
pathways
of
Ser
synthesis;
the
breakdown
of
formate
to
CO
(
2
)
by
the
FDH
reaction
is
the
primary
and
preferred
fate
of
the
organic
acid
in
Arabidopsis
.

The
ratio
between
the
GDC
/
SHMT
and
C1-THF
synthase
/
SHMT
pathways
of
Ser
synthesis
from
[
alpha-
(
13
)
C
]
Gly
and
[
(
13
)
C
]
formate
,
respectively
,
in
Arabidopsis
shoots
was
21
:
1;
in
roots
,
9
:
1
.

In
shoots
,
therefore
,
the
pathway
from
formate
plays
only
a
small
role
in
Ser
synthesis;
in
the
case
of
roots
,
results
indicated
that
the
9
:
1
ratio
was
as
a
result
of
greater
fluxes
of
(
13
)
C
through
both
pathways
together
with
a
relatively
higher
contribution
from
the
C1-THF
synthase
/
SHMT
route
than
in
shoots
.

We
also
examined
the
synthesis
of
Ser
in
a
GDC-deficient
mutant
of
Arabidopsis
(
glyD
)
where
the
GDC
/
SHMT
pathway
was
impaired
.

Compared
with
WT
,
glyD
plants
accumulated
5-fold
more
Gly
than
WT
after
supplying
[
alpha-
(
13
)
C
]
Gly
for
24
h;
the
accumulation
of
Ser
from
[
alpha-
(
13
)
C
]
Gly
was
reduced
by
25%
in
the
same
time
period
.

On
the
other
hand
,
the
accumulation
of
Ser
through
the
C1-THF
synthase
/
SHMT
pathway
in
glyD
plants
was
2
.
5-fold
greater
than
that
in
WT
plants
.

Our
experiments
confirmed
that
the
GDC
/
SHMT
and
C1-THF
synthase
/
SHMT
pathways
normally
operate
independently
in
Arabidopsis
plants
but
that
when
the
primary
GDC
/
SHMT
pathway
is
impaired
the
alternative
C1-THF
synthase
/
SHMT
pathway
can
partially
compensate
for
deficiencies
in
the
synthesis
of
Ser
.
Strontium
stimulates

matrix
formation
in

.

However
,
the
mechanisms
governing
these

In
this
study
,
chondrocytes
were
isolated
from
rat
articular
cartilage
by
enzymatic
digestion
and
cultured
for
24-72
h
with
1-5
mM
strontium
.

We
investigated
the
effects
of
different
concentrations
of
strontium
on
collagen
content
,
type

collagen
,
insulin-like
growth
factor
(
IGF-1
)
and

in
rat
cultured
articular
chondrocytes
in

.

The
collagen
content
of
the
chondrocytes
,
determined
as
hydroxyproline
,
was
measured
by
a
colorimetry
method
.

Type
II
collagen
,
IGF-1
,
and
MMP-13
mRNA
abundance
and
protein
expression
levels
were
determined
by
real-time
polymerase
chain
reaction
(
real-time
PCR
)
and
western
blot
,
respectively
.

The
results
showed
that
collagen
content
from
the
chondrocytes
extracellular
matrix
increased
with
increasing
strontium
concentration
.

Moreover
,
3
and
5
mM
strontium
strongly
stimulated
protein
expression
and
mRNA
levels
of
type
II
collagen
and
IGF-1
.

Conversely
,
MMP-13
expression
in
chondrocytes
decreased
dose-dependently
with
increasing
strontium
concentration
.

These
results
should
provide
insight
into
the
ability
of
strontium
to
promote
chondrocyte
extracellular
matrix
synthesis
.

Strontium
could
promote
collagen
synthesis
and
suppress
collagen
degradation
via
the
repression
of
MMP-13
expression
.

on
lung
toxicity
.

Mice
were
exposed
(
0-30
µg
per
mouse
)
by
pharyngeal
aspiration
and
pulmonary
toxicity
was
assessed
over
a
112-day
time
course
.

Whole
lung
lavage
data
indicated
that
NB1-
and
NB2-exposed
mice
,
but
not
NS-exposed
mice
,
had
significant
dose-
and
time-dependent
pulmonary
inflammation
and
damage
.

Histopathological
analyses
at
112
days
postexposure
determined
no
interstitial
fibrosis
in
any
NS-exposed
mice
,
an
increased
incidence
in
30
µg
NB1-exposed
mice
,
and
significant
interstitial
fibrosis
in
30
µg
NB2-exposed
mice
.

At
112
days
postexposure
,
lung
burden
of
NS
was
decreased
by
96
.
4%
and
NB2
by
80
.
5%
from
initial
deposition
levels
.

At
112
days
postexposure
,
enhanced
dark
field
microscopy
determined
that
alveolar
macro-
phages
were
the
dominant
deposition
site
,
but
a
fraction
of
NB1
and
NB2
was
observed
in
the
alveolar
interstitial
spaces
.

For
the
30
µg
exposure
groups
at
112
days
postexposure
,
confocal
micro-
scopy
and
immunofluorescent
staining
demonstrated
that
retained
NB2
but
not
NS
were
present
in
the
interstitium
subjacent
to
the
terminal
bronchiole
near
the
normal
location
of
the
smallest
lymphatic
capillaries
in
the
lung
.

These
lymphatic
capillaries
play
a
critical
role
in
particle
clearance
,
and
the
accumulation
of
NB2
,
but
not
NS
,
suggests
possible
impaired
lymphatic
clearance
by
the
high
aspect
ratio
particles
.

In
summary
,
our
data
indicate
that
TiO
(
2

NP
shape
alters
pulmonary
responses
,
with
severity
of
responses
being
ranked
as
NS
<
NB1
<
NB2
.
The
L1
stalk
is
a
prominent
mobile
element
of
the
large
ribosomal
subunit
.

We
explore
the
structure
and
dynamics
of
its
non-canonical
rRNA
elements
,
which
include
two
kink-turns
,
an
internal
loop
,
and
a
tetraloop
.

We
use
bioinformatics
to
identify
the
L1
stalk
RNA
conservation
patterns
and
carry
out
over
11
.
5
μs
of
MD
simulations
for
a
set
of
systems
ranging
from
isolated
RNA
building
blocks
up
to
complexes
of
L1
stalk
rRNA
with
the
L1
protein
and
tRNA
fragment
.

We
show
that
the
L1
stalk
tetraloop
has
an
unusual
GNNA
or
UNNG
conservation
pattern
deviating
from
major
GNRA
and
YNMG
RNA
tetraloop
families
.

We
suggest
that
this
deviation
is
related
to
a
highly
conserved
tertiary
contact
within
the
L1
stalk
.

The
available
X-ray
structures
contain
only
UCCG
tetraloops
which
in
addition
differ
in
orientation
(
anti
vs
syn
)
of
the
guanine
.

Our
analysis
suggests
that
the
anti
orientation
might
be
a
mis-refinement
,
although
even
the
anti
interaction
would
be
compatible
with
the
sequence
pattern
and
observed
tertiary
interaction
.

Alternatively
,
the
anti
conformation
may
be
a
real
substate
whose
population
could
be
pH-dependent
,
since
the
guanine
syn
orientation
requires
protonation
of
cytosine
in
the
tertiary
contact
.

In
absence
of
structural
data
,
we
use
molecular
modeling
to
explore
the
GCCA
tetraloop
that
is
dominant
in
bacteria
and
suggest
that
the
GCCA
tetraloop
is
structurally
similar
to
the
YNMG
tetraloop
.

Kink-turn
Kt-77
is
unusual
due
to
its
11-nucleotide
bulge
.

The
simulations
indicate
that
the
long
bulge
is
a
stalk-specific
eight-nucleotide
insertion
into
consensual
kink-turn
only
subtly
modifying
its
structural
dynamics
.

We
discuss
a
possible
evolutionary
role
of
helix
H78
and
a
mechanism
of
L1
stalk
interaction
with
tRNA
.

We
also
assess
the
simulation
methodology
.

The
simulations
provide
a
good
description
of
the
studied
systems
with
the
latest
bsc0χOL3
force
field
showing
improved
performance
.

Still
,
even
bsc0χOL3
is
unable
to
fully
stabilize
an
essential
sugar-edge
H-bond
between
the
bulge
and
non-canonical
stem
of
the
kink-turn
.

Inclusion
of
Mg
(
2
+
)
ions
may
deteriorate
the
simulations
.

On
the
other
hand
,
monovalent
ions
can
in
simulations
readily
occupy
experimental
Mg
(
2
+
)
binding
sites
.
RATIONALE
:
Recent
studies
provide
evidence
for
reduced
phosphodiesterase-4B
(
PDE4B
)
as
a
genetic
susceptibility
factor
as
well
as
suggesting
an
association
of
several
single
nucleotide
polymorphisms
(
SNPs
)
in
PDE4B
that
are
associated
with
an
increased
incidence
of
schizophrenia
.

OBJECTIVES
:
The
aim
of
the
current
study
was
to
assess
the
activity
of
rolipram
,
a
nonsubtype-selective
PDE4
inhibitor
,
in
several
animal
models
predictive
of
antipsychotic-like
efficacy
and
side-effect
liability
and
to
use
PDE4B
wild-type
and
knockout
mice
to
begin
to
understand
the
subtypes
involved
in
the
activity
of
rolipram
.

RESULTS
:
In
rats
,
rolipram
antagonized
both
phencyclidine
hydrochloride-
and
D-amphetamine-induced
hyperactivity
and
inhibited
conditioned
avoidance
responding
(
CAR
)
.

In
PDE4B
wild-type
mice
,
rolipram
dose-dependently
suppressed
CAR
(
ED
(
50
)
=
2
.
4
mg
/
kg
)
;
however
,
in
knockout
mice
,
their
sensitivity
to
rolipram
at
the
higher
doses
(
1
.
0
and
3
.
2
mg
/
kg
)
was
reduced
,
resulting
in
a
threefold
shift
in
the
ED
(
50
)
(
7
.
3
mg
/
kg
)
,
suggesting
PDE4B
is
involved
,
at
least
in
part
,
with
the
activity
of
rolipram
.

Only
the
highest
dose
of
rolipram
(
3
.
2
mg
/
kg
)
produced
a
modest
but
significant
degree
of
catalepsy
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
Rolipram
has
a
pharmacologic
profile
similar
to
that
of
the
atypical
antipsychotics
and
has
low
extrapyramidal
symptom
liability
.

These
results
suggest
that
PDE4B
mediates
the
antipsychotic
effects
of
rolipram
in
CAR
and
that
the
PDE4B-regulated
cyclic
adenosine
monophosphate
signaling
pathway
may
play
a
role
in
the
pathophysiology
and
pharmacotherapy
of
psychosis
.

Storage

.

Hypoxia
elicits
a
variety
of
complex
cellular
responses
by
altering
the
activity
of
many
signaling
pathways
,
such
as
the
oxygen-dependent
prolyl-hyroxylase
domain-containing
enzyme
(
PHD
)
.

Reduction
of
PHD
activity
during
hypoxia
leads
to
stabilization
and
accumulation
of
hypoxia
inducible
factor
(
HIF
)
1α
.

We
examined
the
effects
of
PHD
inhibiton
by
dimethyloxalylglycine
on
the
vasomotor
responses
of
isolated
rat
aorta
and
aortic
vascular
smooth
muscle
cells
(
VSMCs
)
in
a
model
of
cold
ischemia
/
warm
reperfusion
.

Aortic
segments
underwent
24
hours
of
cold
ischemic
preservation
in
saline
or
DMOG
(
dimethyloxalylglycine
)
-supplemented
saline
solution
.

We
investigated
endothelium-dependent
and
-independent
vasorelaxations
.

To
simulate
IR
injury
,
hypochlorite
(
NaOCl
)
was
added
during
warm
reperfusion
.

VSMCs
were
incubated
in
NaCl
or
DMOG
solution
at
4°C
for
24
hours
after
the
medium
was
changed
for
a
supplied
standard
medium
at
37°C
for
6
hours
.

Apoptosis
was
assessed
using
the
TUNEL
method
.

Gene
expression
analysis
was
performed
using
quantitative
real-time
polymerase
chain
reaction
.

Cold
ischemic
preservation
and
NaOCl
induced
severe
endothelial
dysfunction
,
which
was
significantly
improved
by
DMOG
supplementation
(
maximal
relaxation
of
aortic
segments
to
acetylcholine
:
control
95%
±
1%
versus
NaOCl
44%
±
4%
versus
DMOG
68%
±
5%
)
.

Number
of
TUNEL-positive
cell
nuclei
was
significantly
higher
in
the
NaOCl
group
,
and
DMOG
treatment
significantly
decreased
apoptosis
.

Inducible
heme-oxygenase
1
mRNA
expressions
were
significantly
higher
in
the
DMOG
group
.

Inhibition
of
PHDs
could
therefore
be
a
new
therapeutic
avenue
for
protecting
endothelium
and
vascular
muscle
cells
against
IR
injury
.

Salicylic
acid
(
SA
)
,
an
endogenous
signaling
molecule
of
plants
,
possesses
anti-inflammatory
and
anti-neoplastic
actions
in
human
.

Its
derivative
,
aspirin
,
is
the
most
commonly
used
anti-inflammatory
and
analgesic
drug
.

Aspirin
and
sodium
salicylate
(
salicylates
)
have
been
reported
to
have
multiple
pharmacological
actions
.

However
,
it
is
unclear
whether
they
bind
to
a
cellular
protein
.

Here
,
we
report
for
the
first
time
the
purification
from
human
fibroblasts
of
a
approximately
78
kDa
salicylate
binding
protein
with
sequence
identity
to
immunoglobulin
heavy
chain
binding
protein
(
BiP
)
.

The
Kd
values
of
SA
binding
to
crude
extract
and
to
recombinant
BiP
were
45
.
2
and
54
.
6
microM
,
respectively
.

BiP
is
a
chaperone
protein
containing
a
polypeptide
binding
site
recognizing
specific
heptapeptide
sequence
and
an
ATP
binding
site
.

A
heptapeptide
with
the
specific
sequence
displaced
SA
binding
in
a
concentration-dependent
manner
whereas
a
control
heptapeptide
did
not
.

Salicylates
inhibited
ATPase
activity
stimulated
by
this
specific
heptapeptide
but
did
not
block
ATP
binding
or
induce
BiP
expression
.

These
results
indicate
that
salicylates
bind
specifically
to
the
polypeptide
binding
site
of
BiP
in
human
cells
that
may
interfere
with
folding
and
transport
of
proteins
important
in
inflammation
.
The
activity
of
penicillins
against
bacteria
is
in
large
part
related
to
binding
to
specific
receptor
proteins
involved
in
cell
wall
biosynthesis
.

These
proteins
have
been
designated
penicillin-binding
proteins
.

They
can
be
separated
into
distinct
entities
through
the
use
of
acrylamide
gel
electrophoresis
and
binding
of
radioactive
14C-labeled
penicillin
G
.

Six
major
proteins
have
been
defined
in
the
Enterobacteriaceae
,
penicillin-binding
proteins
1
to
6
.

Selection
of
mutants
has
shown
that
there
are
three
essential
proteins
:
penicillin-binding
protein
1
,
which
is
divided
into
penicillin-binding
protein
1Bs
,
a
peptidoglycan
transpeptidase
,
and
penicillin-binding
protein
1A
,
which
acts
as
a
replacement
for
penicillin-binding
protein
1Bs
.

Penicillin-binding
protein
2
is
a
murein-elongation
initiating
enzyme
and
penicillin-binding
protein
3
is
a
septal
murein-synthesizing
enzyme
.

Penicillin-binding
proteins
4
,
5
,
and
6
are
not
essential
for
bacterial
survival
.

Binding
of
penicillins
to
penicillin-binding
protein
1Bs
produces
lysis
,
binding
to
penicillin-binding
protein
2
produces
round
cells
,
and
binding
to
penicillin-binding
protein
3
produces
long
filaments
.

Amdinocillin
is
a
beta-amidino
penicillanic
acid
derivative
that
binds
specifically
to
penicillin-binding
protein
2
.

The
compound
is
more
beta-lactamase
stable
than
ampicillin
and
has
no
major
delay
in
entry
into
the
periplasmic
space
as
do
some
penicillins
.

Amdinocillin
inhibits
most
of
the
Enterobacteriaceae
,
with
the
exception
of
some
indole-positive
Proteus
species
,
but
it
does
not
inhibit
gram-positive
cocci
or
Pseudomonas
aeruginosa
.

Amdinocillin
produces
spherical
bacterial
cells
that
eventually
lyse
.

Its
activity
in
vitro
is
markedly
affected
by
ionic
content
of
media
.

This
agent
acts
synergistically
with
many
penicillins
,
such
as
ampicillin
,
carbenicillin
,
and
the
like
,
and
with
cephalosporins
,
cefazolin
,
cefamandole
,
or
cefoxitin
to
inhibit
gram-negative
bacilli
,
probably
on
the
basis
of
binding
to
different
proteins
needed
for
the
production
of
the
peptidoglycan
of
the
bacterial
cell
wall
.

Amdinocillin
possesses
a
number
of
the
essentials
for
effective
antimicrobial
activity
and
,
by
virtue
of
its
enhancement
of
the
activity
of
other
beta-lactams
,
may
prove
to
be
a
useful
agent
in
the
chemotherapy
of
certain
infections
.
Relaxin
is
a
polypeptide
hormone
involved
in
remodeling
of
the
birth
canal
during
parturition
.

It
is
synthesized
as
a
preprohormone
precursor
,
which
undergoes
specific
processing
to
form
the
mature
two-chain
disulfide-linked
active
species
that
is
secreted
by
the
cell
.

A
major
part
of
this
processing
requires
endoproteolytic
cleavage
at
specific
pairs
of
basic
amino
acid
residues
,
an
event
necessary
for
the
maturation
of
a
variety
of
important
biologically
active
proteins
,
such
as
insulin
and
nerve
growth
factor
.

Human
type
2
preprorelaxin
was
coexpressed
in
human
kidney
293
cells
with
the
candidate
prohormone
convertase-processing
enzymes
mPC1
or
mPC2
,
both
cloned
from
the
mouse
pituitary
tumor
AtT-20
cell
line
,
or
with
the
yeast
kex2
alpha-mating
factor-converting
enzyme
from
Saccharomyces
cerevisiae
.

Prorelaxin
expressed
alone
in
293
cells
was
secreted
into
the
culture
medium
unprocessed
.

Transient
coexpression
with
mPC1
or
kex2
,
but
not
with
mPC2
,
resulted
in
the
secretion
of
a
low
mol
wt
species
with
an
electrophoretic
mobility
very
similar
,
if
not
identical
,
to
that
of
authentic
mature
relaxin
purified
from
human
placenta
.

This
species
was
precipitable
by
monoclonal
antibodies
specific
for
relaxin
and
had
a
retention
time
on
reverse
phase
HPLC
comparable
to
that
of
relaxin
.

Its
analysis
by
both
electrospray
and
fast
atom
bombardment
mass
spectrometry
generated
mass
data
that
were
consistent
only
with
mature
relaxin
.

The
basic
residues
required
for
mPC1-dependent
cleavage
of
prorelaxin
are
defined
by
site-directed
mutagenesis
.
BACKGROUND
:
The
risk
of
postoperative
immune
reaction
/
transplant
rejection
is
increased
in
the
presence
of
distinct
risk
factors
.

In
these
situations
,
the
use
of
established
immunosuppressive
agents
(
steroids
,
cyclosporin
)
is
indicated
.

However
,
immune
reactions
can
occur
despite
this
therapy
.

Basiliximab
is
a
monoclonal
antibody
with
a
high
specific
binding
affinity
to
the
IL-2
receptor
of
activated
T-cells
.

After
renal
transplantation
,
the
combination
therapy
with
basiliximab
and
cyclosporin
reduces
the
risk
of
acute
rejection
by
30%
against
placebo
.

The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
investigate
the
effect
of
complementary
immune
suppression
with
the
IL-2
synthesis
inhibitor
cyclosporin
and
the
IL-2
receptor
antagonist
basiliximab
on
the
incidence
of
transplant
rejection
after
high-risk
keratoplasty
.

PATIENTS
AND
METHODS
:
In
an
open
pilot
study
,
seven
patients
with
high-risk
keratoplasty
were
treated
with
basiliximab
perioperatively
and
cyclosporin
postoperatively
.

All
patients
had
penetrating
keratoplasty
with
a
non-HLA-matched
corneal
graft
.

RESULTS
:
Seven
patients
were
operated
on
from
12
/
98
through
12
/
99
with
a
corneal
transplant
diameter
between
7
.
1
and
9
.
5
mm
.

Risk
factors
included
extensive
corneal
neovascularization
in
all
patients
(
indications
for
surgery
:
4
cases
with
corneal
scars
after
herpetic
disease
,
2
cases
with
conditions
after
alkali
burns
,
1
case
with
corneal
ulceration
after
thermal
burn
)
.

During
the
follow-up
of
14-25
months
,
no
immune
reaction
has
occurred
,
and
all
transplants
are
clear
.

The
mean
visual
acuity
increased
from
0
.
04
to
0
.
41
postoperatively
.

DISCUSSION
:
The
preliminary
data
on
a
combination
therapy
with
basiliximab
and
cyclosporin
are
promising
.

For
further
evaluation
a
prospective
multicenter
study
is
planned
.
The
aromatic
amino
acid
hydroxylases
represent
a
superfamily
of
structurally
and
functionally
closely
related
enzymes
,
one
of
those
functions
being
reversible
inhibition
by
catechol
derivatives
.

Here
we
present
the
crystal
structure
of
the
dimeric
catalytic
domain
(
residues
117-424
)
of
human
phenylalanine
hydroxylase
(
hPheOH
)
,
cocrystallized
with
various
potent
and
well-known
catechol
inhibitors
and
refined
at
a
resolution
of
2
.
0
A
.

The
catechols
bind
by
bidentate
coordination
to
each
iron
in
both
subunits
of
the
dimer
through
the
catechol
hydroxyl
groups
,
forming
a
blue-green
colored
ligand-to-metal
charge-transfer
complex
.

In

,
Glu330

are
identified
as

in

In

,
the
interaction
with
Glu330
conforms
to
the
structural
explanation
for
the

.

Most
striking
is
the

of

,
compatible
with

The
comparison
demonstrates
some

The
specific
impact
of
enhanced
2-arachidonoylglycerol
signaling
on
corticosterone
plasma
levels
,
however
,
was
not
investigated
so
far
.

Here
we
studied
the
effects
of
the
recently
developed
monoacylglycerol
lipase
inhibitor
JZL184
on
basal
and
stress-induced
corticosterone
levels
in
male
CD1
mice
,
and
found
that
this
compound
dramatically
increased
basal
levels
without
affecting
stress
responses
.

Since
acute
changes
in
corticosterone
levels
can
affect
behavior
,
JZL184
was
administered
concurrently
with
the
corticosterone
synthesis
inhibitor
metyrapone
,
to
investigate
whether
the
previously
shown
behavioral
effects
of
JZL184
are
dependent
on
corticosterone
.

We
found
that
in
the
elevated
plus-maze
,
the
effects
of
JZL184
on
"classical"
anxiety-related
measures
were
abolished
by
corticosterone
synthesis
blockade
.

By
contrast
,
effects
on
the
"ethological"
measures
of
anxiety
(

were
not
affected
by

.

In
the
open-field
,
the
locomotion-enhancing
effects
of
the
compound
were
not
changed
either
.

These
findings
show
that
monoacylglycerol
lipase
inhibition
dramatically
increases
basal
levels
of
corticosterone
.

This
endocrine
effect
partly
affects
the

UNLABELLED
:
Escitalopram
is
the
therapeutically
active
S-enantiomer
of
RS-citalopram
,
a
commonly
prescribed
SSRI
.

The
R-enantiomer
is
essentially
pharmacologically
inactive
.

Escitalopram
10
or
20
mg
/
day
produced
significantly
greater
improvements
in
standard
measurements
of
antidepressant
effect
(

and
Hamilton

)
in
patients
with
major
depressive
disorder
(
MDD
)
than
placebo
in
several
8-week
,
placebo-controlled
,
randomised
,
double-blind
,
multicentre
studies
.

Symptom
improvement
was
rapid
,
with
some
parameters
improving
within
1-2
weeks
of
starting
escitalopram
treatment
.

In
addition
,
escitalopram
showed
earlier
and
clearer
separation
from
placebo
than
RS-citalopram
,
at
one-quarter
to
half
the
dosage
,
in
8-week
,
placebo-controlled
trials;
had
significantly
better
efficacy
than
RS-citalopram
in
a
subgroup
of
patients
with
moderate
MDD
in
a
24-week
trial;
and
produced
sustained
response
and
remission
significantly
faster
than
venlafaxine
extended
release
in
patients
with
MDD
.

Escitalopram
reduced
relapse
rate
compared
with
placebo
and
increased
the
percentage
of
patients
in
remission
in
long-term
trials
(
up
to
52
weeks
)
.

Consistently
significant
improvements
for
all
efficacy
parameters
were
also
observed
in
patients
with
generalised
anxiety
disorder
,
social
anxiety
disorder
and
panic
disorder
treated
with
escitalopram
for
8-12
weeks
in
individual
,
randomised
,
placebo-controlled
,
double-blind
investigations
.

The
good
tolerability
profile
of
escitalopram
is
predictable
and
similar
to
that
of
RS-citalopram
.

Such
adverse
events
as
nausea
,
ejaculatory
problems
,
diarrhoea
and
insomnia
are
expected
but
,
with
the
exception
of
ejaculatory
problems
and
nausea
,
which
is
mild
and
transient
,
these
were
generally
no
more
frequent
than
with
placebo
in
fully
published
clinical
trials
.

No
adverse
events
not
previously
seen
in
acute
trials
were
reported
with
long-term
use
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
Escitalopram
,
the
S-enantiomer
of
RS-citalopram
,
is
a
highly
selective
inhibitor
for
the
serotonin
transporter
,
ameliorates
depressive
symptoms
in
patients
with
MDD
at
half
the
RS-citalopram
dosage
,
has
a
rapid
onset
of
symptom
improvement
and
has
a
predictable
tolerability
profile
of
generally
mild
adverse
events
.

Like
RS-citalopram
,
escitalopram
is
expected
to
have
a
low
propensity
for
drug
interactions
,
a
potential
benefit
in
the
management
of
patients
with
comorbidities
.

In
combination
,
these
properties
place
escitalopram
,
like
other
SSRIs
,
as
first-line
therapy
in
patients
with
MDD
.

Escitalopram
is
indicated
for
use
in
patients
with
panic
disorder
in
Europe
and
,
should
further
evidence
confirm
early
findings
that
escitalopram
reduces
anxiety
,
the
drug
may
well
find
an
additional
role
in
the
management
of
anxiety
disorders
.

Multiple

This
study
examined
the
effect
of
theophylline
on
the
gene
expression
of
secretory
proteins
and
phosphodiesterases
in
the
submaxillary
gland
.

Male
F344
rats
received
saline
or
theophylline
(
50
mg
/
kg
)
intraperitoneally
for
4
days
.

The
gene
expressions
for
the

protein
,
cystatin
S
(
CysS
)
,
and
PDE
subfamilies
3A
and
4D
in
the
submaxillary
gland
were
quantified
using
RT-PCR
.

Theophylline
exposure
resulted
in
a
sustained
increase
in
mRNA
expression
for
CysS
and
PDE3A
,
but
PDE4D
gene
expression
was
unchanged
.

Our
results
suggest
that
submaxillary
hypertrophy
is
primarily
caused
by
the
enhanced
transcription
of
CysS
,
and
that
the
transcription
of
each
PDE
subfamily
gene
is
regulated
differently
.
Very
few
nonpeptide
oxytocin
agonists
have
currently
been
reported
,
and
none
of
them
seem
suitable

of
the
oxytocin
mediated
functions
.

In
an
attempt
to
rationalize
the
design
of
better
tools
,
we
have
systematically
studied
the
structural
determinants
of
the
affinity
and
efficacy
of
representative
ligands
of
the
V
(
1a
)
,
V
(
2
)
,
and
OT
receptor
subtypes
.

Despite
apparently
obvious
similarity
between
the
ligand
structures
on
one
hand
,
and
between
the
receptor
subtypes
on
the
other
hand
,
the
binding
affinity
and
the
functional
activity
profiles
of
truncated
and
hybrid
ligands
highlight
the
subtlety
of
ligand-receptor
interactions
for
obtaining
nonpeptide
OT
receptor
agonists
.
Several
signaling
pathways
are
believed
to
be
involved
in
the
epileptogenic
process
that
triggers
the
subsequent
changes
in
the
brain
causing
epilepsy
.

The
mammalian
target
of
rapamycin
(
mTOR
)
is
a
serine
/
threonine
kinase
that
in
the
brain
,
regulates
several
important
physiological
functions
such
as
neuronal
development
and
synaptic
plasticity
,
and
also
seems
to
be
involved
in
many
pathologies
,
including
epilepsy
and
psychiatric
disorders
.

Previous
work
in
animal
models
of
both
genetic
and
acquired
generalized
convulsive
epilepsies
,
has
suggested
that
modulators
of
the
mTOR
signaling
pathway
may
have
beneficial
neuroprotective
and
antiepileptogenic
effects
.

Here
,
we
investigated
for
the
first
time
,
the
effect
of
some
treatment
schedules
(
i
.

e
.

early
chronic
,
sub-chronic
and
acute
)
with
the
specific
mTOR
inhibitor
rapamycin
,
on
the
development
of
absence
seizures
and
seizure
parameters
as
well
as
depressive-like
behavior
in
WAG
/
Rij
rats
,
a
genetic
model
of
absence
epilepsy
,
epileptogenesis
and
mild-depression
comorbidity
.

In
addition
,
we
studied
the
possible
interaction
between
rapamycin
treatment
and
the
effects
of
bacterial
lipopolysaccharide
(
LPS
)
endotoxin
administration
,
which
is
known
to
aggravate
absence
seizures
through
generation
of
increased
neuroinflammatory
responses
.

We
found
that
rapamycin
(
early
chronic
treatment
for
17
weeks
,
starting
at
P45
)
exhibited
clear
antiepileptogenic
properties
also
in
this
animal
epilepsy
model;
however
,
this
effect
was
accompanied
by
unexpected
prodepressant
effects
.

Both
acute
and
sub-chronic
(
7
day
)
treatments
also
had
anti-absence
properties
,
but
the
sub-chronic
treatment
produced
contrasting
antidepressant
properties
in
the
WAG
/
Rij
rats
that
were
not
seen
in
control
Wistar
rats
.

The
rapamycin
/
LPS
co-administration
studies
showed
that
rapamycin
blocked
or
prevented
the
LPS-dependent
increase
in
absence
seizures
,
suggesting
an
anti-inflammatory-like
protective
action
.

In
conclusion
,
we
have
demonstrated
a
novel
antiepileptogenic
effect
of
rapamycin
in
a
well-established
animal
model
of
absence
epilepsy
,
and
we
suggest
that
this
effect
may
be
mediated
by
the
inhibition
of
inflammatory
processes
that
are
developed
in
the
brain
of
these
specific
animals
during
epileptogenesis
and
during
seizures
.

Our
experiments
here
suggest
new
insights
into
this
intriguing
field
,
which
deserves
to
be
further
explored
.

is

A

has
been
prepared
and
evaluated
in

a
panel
of
human

The

suggest
that
the
existence
of
benzimidazole
ring
and
substitution
of
the
imidazolyl-3-position
with
a
naphthylacyl
or
4-methoxyphenacyl

were
vital
for
modulating
cytotoxic
activity

HIV
entry
is
mediated
by
the
envelope
glycoproteins
gp120
and
gp41
.

The
gp41
subunit
contains
several
functional
domains
:
the
N-terminal
heptad
repeat
(
NHR
)
domains
fold
a
triple
stranded
coiled-coil
forming
a
meta-stable

.

C-terminal
heptad
repeat
(
CHR
)
subsequently
folds
onto
the
hydrophobic
grooves
of
the
NHR
coiled-coil
to
form
a
stable
6-helix
bundle
,
which
juxtaposes
the
viral
and
cellular
membranes
for
fusion
.

The
C34
which
has
34
amino
acid
residues
is
known
as
the
core
structure
in
CHR
.

A
highly
anti-HIV

inhibitor
derived
from

was
designed
.

An
artificial
salt
bridge
was
added
in

With

Cisapride
,
a
gastrointestinal
prokinetic
agent
,
is
known
to
cause
long
Q-T
syndrome
and

.

The
cellular
mechanism
is
not
known
.

The
human
ether-a-go-go-related
gene
(
HERG
)
,
which
encodes
the
rapidly
activating
delayed
rectifier
K
+
current
and
is
important
in
cardiac
repolarization
,
may
serve
as
a
target
for
the
action
of
cisapride
.

We
tested
the
hypothesis
that
cisapride
blocks
HERG
.

The
whole
cell
patch-clamp
recording
technique
was
used
to
study
HERG
channels
stably
expressed
heterologously
in
HEK293
cells
.

Under
voltage-clamp
conditions
,
cisapride
block
of
HERG
is
dose
dependent
with
a
half-maximal
inhibitory
concentration
of
6
.
5
nM
at
22
degrees
C
(
n
=
25
cells
)
.

Currents
rapidly
recovered
with
drug
washout
.

The
onset
of
block
by
cisapride
required
channel
activation
indicative
of
open
or
inactivated
state
blockage
.

Block
of
HERG
with
cisapride
after
channel
activation
was
voltage
dependent
.

At
-20
mV
,
10
nM
cisapride
reduced
HERG
tail-current
amplitude
by
5%
,
whereas
,
at
+
20
mV
,
the
tail-current
amplitude
was
reduced
by
45%
(
n
=
4
cells
)
.

At
-20
and
+
20
mV
,
100
nM
cisapride
reduced
tail-current
amplitude
by
66
and
90%
,
respectively
.

We
conclude
that
cisapride
is
a
potent
blocker
of
HERG
channels
expressed
in
HEK293
cells
.

This
effect
may
account
for
the
clinical
occurrence
of

Perfluorooctanoic
acid
(
PFOA
)
is
in
use
for
the
production
of
fluoropolymers
(
PFT
)
.

Due
to
its
toxic
properties
it
was
proposed
to
replace
the
substance
in
its
industrial
applications
by
homologous
compounds
with
shorter
carbon
chain
length
that
were
supposed
to
be
less
toxic
compared
to
PFOA
,
however
,
the
smaller
PFOA
homologs
are
poorly
characterized
so
far
.

In
this
study
we
have
conducted
a
comparative
analysis
of
the
toxicity
of
perfluorinated
carboxylic
acids
(
PFCA
)
with
a
carbon
chain
length
ranging
from
four
to
twelve
carbon
atoms
.

By
using
the
human
hepatocarcinoma
cell
line
HepG2
as
an
in
vitro
model
for
human
hepatocytes
we
could
show
a
positive
correlation
between
the
carbon
chain
length
of
the
respective
PFCA
and
its
cytotoxicity
.

There
was
,
however
,
no
indication
of
an
apoptotic
mechanism
for
cytotoxicity
.

All
PFCA
under
investigation
were
negative
in
two
independent
genotoxicity
assays
.

As
PFOA
,
being
a
well-known
peroxisome
proliferator
,
the
other
PFCA
tested
in
this
study
were
also
shown
to
activate
human
peroxisome
proliferator-activated
receptor
alpha
(
PPARα
)
with
PFOA
having
the
highest
potential
of
PPARα
activation
.

Moreover
,
the
compounds
showed
weak
potential
to
activate
PPARγ
and
hardly

Taken
together
,

revealed
that
PFCA

be

In
response
to
intense
stress
,
the
tumor
protein
p53
(
p53
)
tumor
suppressor
rapidly
mounts
a
direct
mitochondrial
death
program
that
precedes
transcription-mediated
apoptosis
.

By
eliminating
severely
damaged
cells
,
this
pathway
contributes
to
tumor
suppression
as
well
as
to
cancer
cell
killing
induced
by
both
genotoxic
drugs
and
non-genotoxic
p53-reactivating
molecules
.

Here
we
have
explored
the
role
had
in
this
pathway
by
the
prolyl-isomerase
Pin1
(
peptidylprolyl
cis
/
trans
isomerase
,
NIMA-interacting
1
)
,
a
crucial
transducer
of
p53's
phosphorylation
into
conformational
changes
unleashing
its
pro-apoptotic
activity
.

We
show
that
Pin1
promotes
stress-induced
localization
of
p53
to
mitochondria
both
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
.

In
particular
,
we
demonstrate
that
upon
stress-induced
phosphorylation
of
p53
on
Ser46
by
homeodomain
interacting
protein
kinase
2
,
Pin1
stimulates
its
mitochondrial
trafficking
signal
,
that
is
,
monoubiquitination
.

This
pathway
is
induced
also
by
the
p53-activating
molecule
RITA
,
and
we
demonstrate
the
strong
requirement
of
Pin1
for
the
induction
of
mitochondrial
apoptosis
by
this
compound
.

These
findings
have
significant
implications
for
treatment
of
p53-expressing
tumors
and
for
prospective
use
of
p53-activating
compounds
in
clinics
.
Bupropion

.
Over
the
past
20
years
,
studies
of
transient
receptor
potential
(
TRP
)
channels
have
significantly
extended
our
knowledge
regarding
the
molecular
basis
of
Ca2
+
signals
in
cardiac
myocytes
.

The
functional
significance
of
cardiac
TRP
channels
is
likely
connected
to
the
alteration
of
membrane
potential
or
Ca2
+
entry
into
a
noncontractile
compartment
,
where
gene
expression
responsible
for
various
cardiac
diseases
is
induced
.

This
review
highlights
some
aspects
of
TRP
channels
with
anticipated
roles
in
cardiac
disease
.

Evidence
suggests
that
(
a
)
increased
activities
of
TRPC1
,
TRPC3
,
or
TRPC6
are
involved
in
the
development
of
cardiac
hypertrophy
,
where
these
TRPC
channels
act
as
unique
sensors
for
a
wide
range
of
hypertrophic
stimuli
,
and
(
b
)
mutations
in
TRPM4
are
now
recognized
as
causes
of
human
cardiac
conduction
disorders
.

Ultimately
,
TRP
channels
may
become
novel
pharmacological
targets
in
the
treatment
of
human
cardiac
disease
.
Study

dogs
.
The
voltage-dependent
M-type
potassium
current
(
M-current
)
plays
a
major
role
in
controlling
brain
excitability
by
stabilizing
the
membrane
potential
and
acting
as
a
brake
for
neuronal
firing
.

The
KCNQ2
/
Q3
heteromeric
channel
complex
was
identified
as
the
molecular
correlate
of
the
M-current
.

Furthermore
,
the
KCNQ2
and
KCNQ3
channel
alpha
subunits
are
mutated
in
families
with
benign
familial
neonatal
convulsions
,
a
neonatal
form
of
epilepsy
.

Enhancement
of
KCNQ2
/
Q3
potassium
currents
may
provide
an
important
target
for
antiepileptic
drug
development
.

Here
,
we
show
that
meclofenamic
acid
(
meclofenamate
)
and
diclofenac
,
two
related
molecules
previously
used
as
anti-inflammatory
drugs
,
act
as
novel
KCNQ2
/
Q3
channel
openers
.

Extracellular
application
of
meclofenamate
(
EC
(
50
)
=
25
microM
)
and
diclofenac
(
EC
(
50
)
=
2
.
6
microM
)
resulted
in
the
activation
of
KCNQ2
/
Q3
K
(
+
)
currents
,
heterologously
expressed
in
Chinese
hamster
ovary
cells
.

Both
openers
activated
KCNQ2
/
Q3
channels
by
causing
a
hyperpolarizing
shift
of
the
voltage
activation
curve
(
-23
and
-15
mV
,
respectively
)
and
by
markedly
slowing
the
deactivation
kinetics
.

The
effects
of
the
drugs
were
stronger
on
KCNQ2
than
on
KCNQ3
channel
alpha
subunits
.

In
contrast
,
they
did
not
enhance
KCNQ1
K
(
+
)
currents
.

Both
openers
increased
KCNQ2
/
Q3
current
amplitude
at
physiologically
relevant
potentials
and
led
to
hyperpolarization
of
the
resting
membrane
potential
.

In
cultured
cortical
neurons
,
meclofenamate
and
diclofenac
enhanced
the
M-current
and
reduced
evoked
and
spontaneous
action
potentials
,
whereas
in
vivo
diclofenac
exhibited
an
anticonvulsant
activity
(
ED
(
50
)
=
43
mg
/
kg
)
.

These
compounds
potentially
constitute
novel
drug
templates
for
the
treatment
of
neuronal
hyperexcitability
including
epilepsy
,
migraine
,
or
neuropathic
pain
.
The
pharmacological
treatment
of
obesity
should
be
considered
when
cannot
be
achieved
a
10%
weight
loss
with
diet
therapy
and
physical
activity
.

The
drugs
effective
in
obesity
treatment
may
act
by
different
mechanisms
such
as
reduction
in
food
intake
,
inhibition
of
fat
absorption
,
increase
of
thermogenesis
and
stimulation
of
adipocyte
apoptosis
.

At
present
,
we
only
have
two
marketed
drugs
for
obesity
treatment
.

Sibutramine
is
an
inhibitor
of
norepinephrine
,
dopamine
and
serotonina
reuptake
which
inhibits
food
intake
and
increases
thermogenesis
.

Sibutramine
administration
for
a
year
can
induce
a
weight
loss
of
4-7%
.

Its
main
side
effects
are
hypertension
,
headache
,
insomnia
and
constipation
.

Orlistat
is
an
inhibitor
of
pancreatic
lipase
which
is
able
to
block
the
absorption
of
30%
of
ingested
fat
.

Its
administration
induces
weight
loss
and
reduction
of
ulterior
weight
regain
.

Also
,
this
drug
improves
hypertension
dyslipdaemia
and
helps
to
prevent
diabetes
in
52%
of
cases
when
administered
over
four
years
.

The
increase
in
frequency
of
stools
and
interference
with
vitamin
absorption
are
its
main
side
effects
.

Glucagon-like
peptide
1
,
which
increases
insulin
sensitivity
and
satiety
,
adiponectin
and
PPAR-gamma
agonists
which
reduce
insulin
resistance
and
modulates
adipocyte
generation
are
the
basis
for
future
therapeutic
approaches
of
obesity
.

Phosphatase
inhibitors
induce
PPAR-gamma
phosphorylation
and
UCP-1
expression
leading
to
an
increase
in
thermogenesis
and
reduction
in
appetite
.
In
the
present
study
,
our
aim
was
to
determine
whether
intrafetal
glucose
infusion
increases
fetal
adiposity
,
synthesis
and
secretion
of
leptin
and
regulates
gene
expression
of
the
'appetite
regulatory'
neuropeptides
neuropepetide
Y
(
NPY
)
,
agouti-related

and

)
within
the
fetal
hypothalamus
.

Glucose

of

The
expression
of
OB-Rb
mRNA
was
higher
in
the
ventromedial
nucleus
compared
to
the
arcuate
nucleus
of
the
hypothalamus
in
both
glucose
and
saline
infused
fetuses
(
F

)
and
there
was
a
positive
correlation
between
expression
of
OB-Rb
and
MC3R
mRNA
in
the
arcuate
nucleus
(
r
=
0

)
.

Glucose
infusion
increased
mRNA
expression
for
POMC
,
but
not
for
the
anorectic
neuropeptide
CART
,
or
the
orexigenic
neuropeptides
NPY
and
AGRP
,
in
the
arcuate
nucleus
of
the
fetal
hypothalamus
.

These
findings
demonstrate
that
increased
circulating
glucose
and
insulin
regulate
gene
expression
of
the
neuropeptides
within
the
fetal
hypothalamus
that
are
part
of
the
neural

Pseudohypoaldosteronism
type
1
(
PHA1
)
is
characterized
by
neonatal
salt
wasting
resistant
to
mineralocorticoids
.

There
are
2
forms
of
PHA1
:
the
autosomal
recessive
form
with
symptoms
persisting
into
adulthood
,
caused
by
mutations
in
the
amiloride-sensitive
luminal
sodium
channel
,
and
the
autosomal
dominant
or
sporadic
form
,
which
shows
milder
symptoms
that
remit
with
age
.

Mutations
in
the
gene
encoding
the
human
mineralocorticoid
receptor
(
hMR
)
are
,
at
least
in
some
patients
,
responsible
for
the
latter
form
of
PHA1
.

We
here
report
the
results
of
a
genetic
study
in
a
sporadic
case
and
in
5
affected
patients
from
2
families
with
autosomal
dominant
PHA1
.

In
the
sporadic
case
we
identified
a
new
frameshift
mutation
,
Ins2871C
,
in
exon
9
of
the
hMR
gene
.

Family
members
were
asymptomatic
and
had
no
mutation
.

This
mutation
is
the
first
described
in
exon
9
and
impairs
the
last
27
amino
acids
of
the
hormone-binding
domain
.

In
2
kindreds
with
autosomal
dominant
PHA1
we
found
no
mutation
of
the
hMR
gene
.

Our
results
confirm
the
hypothesis
that
autosomal
dominant
or
sporadic
PHA1
is
a
genetically
heterogeneous
disease
involving
other
,
as
yet
unidentified
,
genes
.
Therapeutic
oral
anticoagulation
is
still
commonly
achieved
by
administration
of
warfarin
or
other
vitamin
K
antagonists
that
are
associated
with
an
untoward
pharmacokinetic
/
pharmacodynamic
(
PK
/
PD
)
profile
leading
to
a
high
incidence
of
bleeding
complications
or
therapeutic
failure
.

Hence
,
there
is
an
unmet
medical
need
of
novel
easy-to-use
oral
anticoagulants
with
improved
efficacy
and
safety
.

Recent
developments
include
the
identification
of
non-peptidic
small-molecules
that
selectively
inhibit
certain
serine
proteases
within
the
coagulation
cascade
.

Of
these
,
the
thrombin
inhibitor
dabigatran
and
factor
Xa
inhibitor
rivaroxaban
have
recently
been
licensed
for
thromboprophylaxis
after
orthopaedic
surgery
mainly
in
Europe
.

In
addition
,
the
factor
Xa
inhibitor
apixaban
is
in
late-stage
clinical
development
.

Each
drug
is
prescribed
at
fixed
doses
without
the
need
of
anticoagulant
monitoring
.

Phase
III
trials
in
orthopaedic
patients
essentially
resulted
in
non-inferior
efficacy
of
dabigatran
and
superior
efficacy
of
rivaroxaban
over
enoxaparin
without
any
marked
differences
of
drug
safety
,
while
apixaban
data
is
still
controversial
.

However
,
alterations
of
rivaroxaban
and
apixaban
pharmacokinetics
upon
interactions
with
inhibitors
and
inducers
of
CYP3A4
or
P-glycoprotein
may
complicate
the
use
of
these
compounds
in
daily
practice
,
whereas
dabigatran
elimination
largely
depends
on
renal
function
.

Hence
,
this
review
reports
PK
/
PD
,
efficacy
and
safety
data
of
dabigatran
,
rivaroxaban
and
apixaban
throughout
preclinical
and
clinical
development

It
has
been
recognised
that
the
active
transport
of
L-phenylalanine
and
its
autocrine
turnover
to
L-tyrosine
via
phenylalanine
hydroxylase
in
the
cytosol
of
epidermal
melanocytes
provides
the
majority
of
the
L-tyrosine
pool
for
melanogenesis
.

In
this
context
,
it
has
been
shown
that
the
cofactor
6
(
R
)
-L-erythro
5
,
6
,
7
,
8
tetrahydrobiopterin
(
6BH4
)
is
produced
de

,
recycled
and
regulated
in
both
epidermal
melanocytes
and
keratinocytes
to
control
tyrosine
hydroxylase
,
phenylalanine
hydroxylase
and
tyrosinase
activity
.

Inhibition
of
the
enzymes
by
excessive
6BH4
levels
is
reversible
with
alpha-MSH
by
specific
complex
formation
between
6BH4
and
the
hormone
.

This
direct
mechanism
of
alpha-MSH
is
supported
by
the
presence
of
the
entire
POMC
processing
system
in
the
melanosome
indicating
a
receptor
independent
control
of
eumelanogenesis
.

Finally
,
the
role
of
tyrosinase
,
TRP-1
and
TRP2
is
discussed
in
association
with
oxidative
stress
specifically
related
to
hydrogen
peroxide

The
present
article
describes
the
purification
and
biophysical
characterization
of
the
mitochondrial
creatine
kinase
isoenzyme
from
chicken
brain
(
Mia-CK
)
.

Gel
permeation
chromatography
,
direct
mass
measurements
of
individual
molecules
by
scanning
transmission
electron
microscopy
,
and
analytical
ultracentrifugation
confirmed
the
existence
of
two
different
oligomeric
forms
,
dimeric
and
octameric
Mia-CK
,
with
molecular
masses
of
85
kDa
and
306-352
kDa
and
with

constants
of
4

.

and

,
respectively
.

In
addition
,
it
was
tested
if
Mia-
and
Mib-CK
can
form
heterodimeric
and
heterooctameric
molecules
with
subunits
of
other
CK
isoenzymes
.

By
denaturation
in
urea
or
guanidine
hydrochloride
and
subsequent
renaturation
,
MiaMib-CK
and
surprisingly
also
MiaM-CK
heterodimers
could
be
generated
.

In
contrast
,
no
heterodimers
were
obtained
between
Mib-
and
M-
or
B-CK
.

Furthermore
,
reoctamerization
of
a
mixture
of
Mia-
and
Mib-CK
homodimers
led
to
the
formation
of
MiaMib-CK
heterooctamers
.

In
these
heterooctamers
,
the
Mia-
and
Mib-CK
homodimers
remained
the
fundamental
building
blocks
.

No
subunit
exchange
between
adjacent
dimers
within
the
heterooctamer
could
be
observed
even
after
storage
for
3
months
at
4
degrees
C
.

The
relevance
of
these
data
on
the
structural
organization
of
the
Mi-CK
octamer
and
on
the
physiological
aspects
of
tissue-specific

Activation
of

was
documented
by
observing
dose-dependent
increases
in
mesenteric

pressure
after
intramesenteric

of
methoxamine;
alpha
2-adrenoceptor
activity
was
confirmed
by
finding
similar
increases
in
mesenteric
perfusion
pressure
after
intramesenteric
arterial
injections
of
BHT

The
mesenteric
vasoconstrictor
response
to

(
an
alpha
2-adrenoceptor
agonist
)
also
was
blunted
by
WB

,
but
not
by
CEC
.

These
data

The
scientific
rationale
of
pharmacologically
inhibiting
phosphodiesterase
type
5
(
PDE5
)
in
the
treatment
of
erectile
dysfunction
(
ED
)
is
reviewed
.

Published
literature
on
the
nitric
oxide-cyclic
guanosine
monophosphate
(
cGMP
)
pathway
for
penile
erection
and
on
PDE5
inhibition
using
sildenafil
as
the
model
for
pharmacologic
PDE5
inhibition
are
assessed
.

The
key
second
messenger
in
the
mediation
of
penile
erection
is
cGMP
.

PDE5
is
the
predominant
PDE
in
the
corpus
cavernosum
,
and
cGMP
is
its
primary
substrate
.

Therefore
,
in
men
with
ED
,
elevation
of
cGMP
in
corpus
cavernosal
tissue
via
selective
inhibition
of
cGMP-specific
PDE5
is
a
means
of
improving
erectile
function
at
minimal
risk
of
adverse
events
.

This
approach
is
validated
by
the
clinical
efficacy
and
safety
of
sildenafil
,
the
pioneering
drug
for
selective
PDE5
inhibitor
therapy
for
ED
.

Sildenafil
exhibits
inhibitory
potency
against
PDE5
and
a
10-fold
lower
dose-related
inhibitory
potency
against
rod
outer
segment
PDE6
,
the
predominant
PDE
in
the
phototransduction
cascade
in
rods
.

Thus
,
its
pharmacologic
profile
is
predictable
,
with
close
correlation
between
pharmacodynamic
and
pharmacokinetic
properties
.

Clinically
,
sildenafil
improves
erectile
function
in
a
large
percentage
of
men
with
ED
.

The
most
common
adverse
events
are
due
to
PDE5
inhibition
in
vascular
and
visceral
smooth
muscle;
similar
adverse
events
are
expected
during
therapeutic
use
of
all
PDE5
inhibitors
.

As
free
sildenafil
plasma
concentrations
approach
concentrations
sufficient
to
inhibit
retinal
PDE6
,
usually
at
higher
therapeutic
doses
,
transient
,
reversible
visual
adverse
events
can
occur
,
albeit
infrequently
.

Selective
inhibition
of
PDE5
is
a
rational
therapeutic
approach
in
ED
,
as
proved
by
the
clinical
success
of
sildenafil
.
Prostaglandins

In

,
which
model
distal
tubule
cells
,
the
transcription
of
the
Na
,
K-ATPase
beta1
subunit
is
regulated
by
PGE1
and
PGE2
.

To
identify
the
EP

that
mediate
transcriptional
regulation
,
transient
transfection
studies
are
conducted
using
the
human
beta1promoter
/
luciferase
construct
,

.

The
involvement
of
EP1
and
EP2
receptors
is
indicated
by
studies
with
the
EP1
selective
agonist
17-phenyl
trinor
PGE2
,
and
the
EP2
selective
agonist
butaprost
(
which
stimulate
)
,
as
well
as
by
studies
with
the
antagonists
SC-51089
(
EP1
specific
)
and
AH
6809
(
EP1
and
EP2
specific
)
.

Consistent
with
the
involvement
of
Gs
coupled
EP2
receptors
,
is
that
the
PGE1
stimulation
is
inhibited
by
the
PKAI
expression
vector
(
encoding
the
protein
kinase
A
(
PKA
)
inhibitory
protein
)
,
as
well
as
by
the
myristolated
PKA
inhibitory
peptide
PKI
.

In
addition
to
this
evidence
(
for
the
involvement
of
EP2
receptors
)
,
evidence
for
the
involvement
of
EP1
receptors
in
the
PGE1
mediated
stimulation
of
Na
,
K-ATPase
beta

transcription
includes
the
stimulatory
effect
of
17-phenyl
trinor
PGE2
,
as
well
as
the
inhibitory
effects
of
SC-51089
.

Also
consistent
with
the
involvement
of
Gq
coupled
EP1
receptors
,
the
PGE1
stimulation
is
inhibited
by
the
PKCI
vector
(
encoding
the
PKC
inhibitory
domain
)
,
the
PKC
inhibitor

We
determined
the
effects
of
low-level
prenatal
MeHg
exposure
on
neuronal
migration
in
the
developing
rat
cerebral
cortex
using
in
utero
electroporation
.

We
used
offspring
rats
born
to
dams
that
had
been
exposed
to
saline
or
various
doses
of
MeHg
(
0
.
01
mg
/
kg
/
day
,
0
.
1
mg
/

/

,
and
1
mg

)
from
gestational
day
(
GD
)
11-21
.

Immunohistochemical
examination
of
the
brains
of
the
offspring
was
conducted
on
postnatal
day
(
PND
)
0
,
PND3
,
and
PND7
.

Our
results
showed
that
prenatal
exposure
to
low
levels
of
MeHg
(
0
.
1
mg
/
kg
/
day
or
1
mg
/
kg
/
day
)
during
the
critical
stage
in
neuronal
migration
resulted
in
migration
defects
of
the
cerebrocortical
neurons
in
offspring
rats
.

Importantly
,
our
data
revealed
that
the
abnormal
neuronal
distribution
induced
by
MeHg
was
not
caused
by
altered
proliferation
of
neural
progenitor
cells
(
NPCs
)
,
induction
of
apoptosis
of
NPCs
and
/
or
newborn
neurons
,
abnormal
differentiation
of
NPCs
,
and
the
morphological
changes
of
radial
glial
scaffold
,
indicating
that
the
defective
neuronal
positioning
triggered
by
exposure
to
low-dose
of
MeHg
is
due
to
the
impacts
of
MeHg
on
the
process
of
neuronal
migration
itself
.

Moreover
,
we
demonstrated
that
in
utero
exposure
to
low-level
MeHg
suppresses
the
expression
of
Rac1
,
Cdc42
,
and
RhoA
,
which
play
key
roles
in
the
migration
of
cerebrocortical
neurons
during
the
early
stage
of
brain
development
,
suggesting
that
the
MeHg-induced
migratory
disturbance
of
cerebrocortical
neurons
is
likely
associated
with
the
Rho
GTPases
signal
pathway
.

In
conclusion
,
our
results
provide
a
novel
perspective
on
clarifying
the
mechanisms
underlying
the
impairment
of
neuronal
migration
induced
by
MeHg
.
BACKGROUND
:
Because
of
the
adverse
characteristics
associated
with
heparin
,
direct
antagonists
of
thrombin
have
been
investigated
as
anticoagulants
during
percutaneous
coronary
interventions
.

However
,
the
hematologic
and
clinical
interactions
between
direct
thrombin
antagonists
and
inhibitors
of
platelet
glycoprotein
IIb-IIIa
are
incompletely
explored
.

METHODS
:
Forty-two
patients
who
underwent
elective
percutaneous
coronary
intervention
were
randomized
to
receive
a
bivalirudin
1
.
0
mg
/
kg
bolus
followed
by
a
4-hour
infusion
at
2
.
5
mg

a
bivalirudin
0
.
75
mg
/
kg
bolus
followed
by
a
4-hour
infusion
at
1
.
75
mg
/
kg;
or
a
heparin
60
U
/
kg
bolus
.

All
the
patients
also
received
eptifibatide
,
given
as
2
sequential
boluses
of
180
microg
/
kg
followed
by
a
2
microg
/
kg
/
min
infusion
for
18
to
24
hours
,
and
aspirin
.

RESULTS
:
After
the
bolus
dose
of
the
study
drug
,
turbidimetric
platelet
aggregation
in
response
to
5
micromol
/
L
adenosine
diphosphate
increased
in
patients
assigned
to
heparin
but
not
those
assigned
to
bivalirudin
.

After
eptifibatide
,
platelet
aggregation
was
eliminated
in
all
3
treatment
groups
.

The
effect
of
heparin
and
the
effects
of
both
bivalirudin
regimens
on
the
formation
of
thrombin
antithrombin
complexes
and
prothrombin
fragment

.
2
were
comparable
.

Neither
agent
affected
the
formation
of
platelet-monocyte
complexes
or
expression
of
CD
63
lysosomal
antigen
.

There
were
no
major
bleeding
events
,
and
a
single
non-Q-wave
myocardial
infarction
(
MI
)
occurred
in
a
patient
treated
with
bivalirudin
.

CONCLUSION
:
These
findings
show
the
feasibility
of
combining
the
direct
thrombin
antagonist
bivalirudin
with
a
potent
antagonist
of
platelet
glycoprotein
IIb-IIIa
.

Clinical
trials
are
needed
to
assess
the
safety
and
efficacy
of
this
combination
.
The
phytochemical
investigation
of
the
ethylacetate-soluble
fraction
of
Caryopteris
odorata
(
Ham
.

ex
Roxb
.

)
led
to
the
isolation
of
four
new
iridoid
glucosides
(
1-4
)
:
8-O-trans-cinnamoyl
caryoptoside
(
1
)
,
8-O-trans-cinnamoyl
shanzhiside
methylester
(
2
)
,
8-O-trans-cinnamoyl
mussaenoside
(
3
)
and
8-O-cafeoyl
massenoside
(
4
)
.

The
structures
of
these
compounds
were
determined
by
FAB-MS
,
IR
,
1D
and
2D-NMR
spectroscopy
and
by
comparing
with
the
published
data
of
the
closely
related
compounds
.

The
antioxidant
potential
of
the
isolated
iridoids
(
1-4
)
was
evaluated
relative
to
conventionally
used
standards
and
these
molecules
exhibited
good
antioxidant
potential
.

Moreover
,
their
inhibitory
potential
was
also
screened
against
three
enzymes
,
namely
acetyl
cholinesterase
,
butyrylcholinesterase
and
lipoxygenase
.

These
iridoid
glucosides
were
found
to
be
inactive
against
acetyl
and
butyrylcholinesterases
but
active
against
lipoxygenase
.

DNA
polymerase
is
one
of
the
most
important
target
molecules
of
antitumor
agents
,
especially
for
antimetabolite
nucleosides
that
include
1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine
(
araC
)
and
2'-deoxy-2'
,
2'-difluorocytidine
(
gemcitabine
)
.

There
are
several
subtypes
of
mammalian
DNA
polymerases
and
their
localization
and
function
have
been
clarified
.

DNA
polymerase
alpha
,
delta
and
epsilon
have
been
implicated
to
be
responsible
for
DNA
replication
,
whereas
DNA
polymerase
beta
,
delta
and
epsilon
have
been
suggested
to
work
in
DNA
repair
.

DNA
polymerase
gamma
is
encoded
in
the
nucleus
but
localizes
in
the
mitochondria
,
and
is
responsible
for
the
mitochondrial
DNA
replication
.

Recently
,
several
antiviral
nucleoside
analogs
were
reported
to
inhibit
DNA
polymerase
gamma
after
intracellular
phosphorylation
and
cause
severe
chronic
toxicity
.

1-
(
2-Deoxy-2-fluoro-4-thio-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl
)
cytosine
(
4'-thio-FAC
)
,
an
antimetabolite
similar
to
araC
and
gemcitabine
,
is
recently
shown
by
us
to
be
a
very
promising
agent
because
of
its
potent
antitumor
activity
by
oral
administration
to
mice
.

We
tested
for
the
inhibitory
activities
of
the
triphosphates
of
4'-thio-FAC
and
gemcitabine
against
DNA
polymerase
alpha
,
beta
and
gamma
.

The
triphosphates
of
4'-thio-FAC
(
4'-thio-FACTP
)
exhibited
the
potent
inhibitory
action
against
DNA
polymerase
alpha
,
whereas
it
showed
moderate
inhibition
against
DNA
polymerase
beta
and
little
inhibition
against
DNA
polymerase
gamma
.

The
triphosphate
of
gemcitabine
(
dFdCTP
)
did
not
show
potent
inhibition
against
these
three
DNA
polymerases
.

Thus
,
the
effect
on
ribonucleotide
reductase
was
suggested
to
be
more
responsible
for
the
antitumor
action
of
gemcitabine
.

The
differences
in
the
mechanisms
of
action
against
DNA
polymerases
between
these
drugs
and
other
nucleosides
were
also
discussed
.
OBJECTIVE
:
The
metabolic
syndrome
(
MetS
)
is
an
increasing
epidemiologic
challenge
and
cardiovascular
risk
factor
.

Interleukin-6
(
IL-6
)
is
a
cytokine
that
exerts
its
biological
function
via
a
complex
orchestration
of
soluble
and
membrane
bound
receptors
.

We
have
investigated
associations
between
IL-6
and
its
soluble
receptors
,
soluble
IL-6
receptor
(
sIL-6r
)
and
soluble
glycoprotein
130
(
sGP130
)
and
the
metabolic
syndrome
.

Furthermore
,
we
have
investigated
possible
associations
with
endothelial
dysfunction
and
arterial
stiffness
.

METHODS
:
A
total
of
563
subjects
were
included
in
this
study
.

The
Adult
Treatment
Panel
III
criteria
of
the
National
Cholesterol
Education
Program
were
used
for
the
definition
of
MetS
.

We
used
commercially
available
ELISA
to
analyse
circulating
levels
of
the
markers
.

Pulse
wave
propagation
time
(
PWP
)
was
determined
to
assess
arterial
stiffness
.

RESULTS
:
The
criteria
for
having
MetS
were
filled
by
221
subjects
.

sGP130
,
sIL-6r
and
IL-6
levels
were
elevated
in
subjects
with
MetS
(
p<0
.
05
for
all
markers
)
,
and
are
associated
with
increasing
components
of
MetS
.

Particularly
hypertriglyceridaemia
,
hypertension
and
fasting
plasma
glucose
(
FPG
)
seem
to
carry
this
association
.

sGP130
(
p<0

)
,
IL-6
(
p<0
.
05
)
and
partially
sIL-6r
(
p<0
.
05
)
correlated
with
markers
of
endothelial
function
(
E-selectin
,
I-CAM-1
,
V-CAM-1
)
and
inversely
with
PWP
after
adjustment
for
relevant
covariates
.

CONCLUSION
:
sGP130
,
sIL-6r
and
IL-6
were
significantly
elevated
in
subjects
with
MetS
.

In
addition
,
sGP130
,
IL-6
and
partially
sIL-6r
were
associated
with
markers
of
endothelial
function
and
arterial

.

This
finding
sheds
new
light
on
the
role
of
these
inflammatory
cytokines
in
subjects
with
MetS

The

Both

systems
yielded

The

protein
underwent
reduction
in
the
presence
of
either
NADPH-cytochrome

Electrophysiological
studies
showed
that
this
antiport
contributes
to
the
extreme
brevity
of

Synaptotagmin-1
,
a

,
plays
a
major

Here

we

is
necessary
for
expression
of
the

We
measured

in

The
results
were
congruent

Type
II
diabetes
is
a
heterogeneous
disease
where
environment
and
genetics
are
important
factors
for
the
expression
of
the
disease
.

The
high
cost
for
treating
complications
of
diabetes
is
a
burden
for
public
health
systems
and
governments
worldwide
.

Type
II
diabetes
has
been
causing
debilitation
worldwide
for
many
decades
,
and
a
single
drug
that
safely
treats
the
disease
has
yet
to
be
discovered
.

Sulfonylureas
,
biguanides
,
alpha-glucosidase
,
meglitinides
,
DPP-4
inhibitors
and
thiazolidinediones
are
among
the
classes
of
oral
hypoglycemic
drugs
available
to
treat
Type
II
diabetes
,
but
concerns
exist
regarding
safety
and
efficacy
of
these
drugs
.

In
this
article
we
present
the
pros
and
cons
of
the
six
classes
and
discuss
some
of
the
latest
advances
towards
the
development
of
new
drugs
for
the
treatment
of
Type

Distinct
pharmacologic
properties
of
neuromuscular
blocking
agents
on
human
neuronal
nicotinic
acetylcholine
receptors
:
a
possible
explanation
for
the
train-of-four
fade
.
In
this
study
,
we
investigated
the
role
of
intercellular
adhesion
molecule-2
(
ICAM2
)
in
the
testis
.

ICAM2
is
a
cell
adhesion
protein
having
important
roles
in
cell
migration
,
especially
during
inflammation
when
leukocytes
cross
the
endothelium
.

Herein
,
we
showed
ICAM2
to
be
expressed
by
germ
and
Sertoli
cells
in
the
rat
testis
.

When
a
monospecific
antibody
was
used
for
immunolocalization
experiments
,
ICAM2
was
found
to
surround
the
heads
of
elongating
/
elongated
spermatids
in
all
stages
of
the
seminiferous
epithelial
cycle
.

To
determine
whether
ICAM2
is
a
constituent
of
apical
ectoplasmic
specialization
(
ES
)
,
co-immunoprecipitation
and
dual
immunofluorescence
staining
were
performed
.

Interestingly
,
ICAM2
was
found
to
associate
with
β1-integrin
,
nectin-3
,
afadin
,
Src
,
proline-rich
tyrosine
kinase
2
,
annexin
II
,
and
actin
.

Following
CdCl₂
treatment
,
ICAM2
was
found
to
be
upregulated
during
restructuring
of
the
seminiferous
epithelium
,
with
round
spermatids
becoming
increasingly
immunoreactive
for
ICAM2
by
6-16
h
.

Interestingly
,
there
was
a
loss
in
the
binding
of
ICAM2
to
actin
during
CdCl₂-induced
germ
cell
loss
,
suggesting
that
a
loss
of
ICAM2-actin
interactions
might
have
facilitated
junction
restructuring
.

Taken
collectively
,
these
results
illustrate
that
ICAM2
plays
an
important
role
in
apical
ES
dynamics
during
spermatogenesis
.
Over-expression
of
cleaved
cyclin
E
in
breast
tumors
is
closely
associated
with
tumor
progression
and
resistance
to
antiestrogens
.

17β-Estradiol
(
E2
)
has
been
recently
shown
to
induce
cyclin
E
processing
in
breast
cancer
cells
.

Tamoxifen
has
been
used
in
patients
with
estrogen-sensitive
breast
cancer
,
yet
resistance
to
antiestrogens
and
recurrence
will
appear
in
some
of
the
patients
after
its
continued
use
.

We
therefore
addressed
possible
effects
of
tamoxifen
on
the
generation
of
cleaved
cyclin
E
and
its
signal
mechanism
(
s
)
in
estrogen-responsive
MCF-7
breast
cancer
cells
that
express
both
G
protein-coupled
protein
(
GPR
)
30
and
estrogen
receptor
α
(
ERα
)
.

4-Hydroxytamoxifen
(
OHT
,
tamoxifen's
active
form
)
failed
to
prevent
E2-induced
proteolysis
of
cyclin
E
and
migration
,
but
rather
triggered
cyclin
E
cleavage
coincident
with
augmented
migration
.

OHT-induced
cyclin
E
truncation
also
occurred
in
SK-BR-3
cells
that
express
GPR30
and
lack
ERα
,
but
not
in
MDA-MB-231
cells
that
express
neither
GPR30
nor
ERα
.

G1
,
a
specific
GPR
30
agonist
,
caused
dramatic
proteolysis
of
cyclin
E
and
enhanced
migration
.

Furthermore
,
OHT-stimulated
cleavage
of
cyclin
E
and
migration
were
tremendously
attenuated
by
G15
,
a
GPR30
antagonist
,
or
siRNA
against
GPR30
.

In
addition
,
inhibitors
for
EGFR
or
ERK1
/
2
remarkably
suppressed
OHT-induced
truncation
of
cyclin
E
,
suggesting
involvement
of
EGFR
signaling
.

Collectively
,
our
data
indicate
that
OHT
contributes
to
the
production
of
proteolyzed
cyclin
E
via
GPR30
with
augmented
migration
in
MCF-7
cells
.

Nitric
oxide
(
NO
)
is
involved
in
many
physiological
and
pathological
processes
in
the
brain
.

NO
is
synthesized
from
arginine
by
nitric
oxide
synthase
(
NOS
)
,
and
the
citrulline
generated
as
a
by-product
can
be
recycled
to
arginine
by
argininosuccinate
synthetase
(
AS
)
and
argininosuccinate
lyase
(
AL
)
via
the
citrulline-NO
cycle
.

When
neuronal
PC12
cells
differentiated
with
nerve
growth
factor
were
treated
with
interferon-gamma
(
IFNgamma
)
and
tumor
necrosis
factor-alpha
(
TNFalpha
)
,
iNOS
and
AS
mRNAs
and
proteins
were
markedly
induced
,
with
AL
mRNA
and
protein
being
weakly
induced
.

Cationic
amino
acid
transporter-1
and
-2
were
not
induced
.

IFNgamma
or
TNFalpha
alone
was
ineffective
.

A

)
in

h
)
was
produced
from
arginine
by
cytokine-stimulated
cells
,
and
arginine
could
be
replaced
by
citrulline
.

iNOS
induction
and
NO
production
were
attenuated
by
dexamethasone
and
dibutyryl
cAMP
and
even
more
strongly
so
when
combined
.

Therefore
,
a
large
amount
of
NO
is
produced
in
cytokine-stimulated
PC12
cells
following
to
induction
of
iNOS
and
citrulline-arginine

Platelet
activation
by
ADP
and
ATP
plays
a
crucial
role
in
haemostasis
and
thrombosis
,
and
their
so-called
P2
receptors
are
potential
targets
for
antithrombotic
drugs
.

The
ATP-gated
channel
P2X1
and
the
2
G
protein-coupled
P2Y1
and
P2Y12
ADP
receptors
selectively
contribute
to
platelet
aggregation
.

The
P2Y1
receptor
is
responsible
for
ADP-induced
shape
change
and
weak
and
transient
aggregation
,
while
the
P2Y12
receptor
is
responsible
for
the
completion
and
amplification
of
the
response
to
ADP
and
to
all
platelet
agonists
,
including
thromboxane
A2
(
TXA2
)
,
thrombin
,
and
collagen
.

The
P2X1
receptor
is
involved
in
platelet
shape
change
and
in
activation
by
collagen
under
shear
conditions
.

Due
to
its
central
role
in
the
formation
and
stabilization
of
a
thrombus
,
the
P2Y12
receptor
is
a
well-established
target
of
antithrombotic
drugs
like
ticlopidine
or
clopidogrel
,
which
have
proved
efficacy
in
many
clinical
trials
and
experimental
models
of
thrombosis
.

Competitive
P2Y12
antagonists
have
also
been
shown
to
be
effective
in
experimental
thrombosis
as
well
as
in
several
clinical
trials
.

Studies
in
P2Y1
and
P2X1
knockout
mice
and
experimental
thrombosis
models
using
selective
P2Y1
and
P2X1
antagonists
have
shown
that
,
depending
on
the
conditions
,
these
receptors
could
also
be
potential
targets
for
new
antithrombotic
drugs

The
implementation
of
a
reactive
functional
group
onto
a
material
surface
is
of
great
importance
.

Reactive
functional
groups
(
e
.

g
.

,
an
amino
group
and
a
hydroxyl
group
)
are
usually
hydrophilic
,
which
makes
it
difficult
to
display
them
on
a
dry
polymer
surface
.

We
here
propose
a
novel
method
for
displaying
amino
groups
on
the
surfaces
of
polymeric
substrates
through
dip-coating
of
a
methacrylate-based
copolymer
.

We
synthesized
copolymers
composed
of
methyl
methacrylate
and
2-aminoethyl
methacrylate
with
different
protecting
groups
or
ion-complexes
on
their
amino
groups
,
then
dip-coated
the
copolymers
onto
a
poly
(
methyl
methacrylate
)
(
PMMA
)
substrate
.

Evaluation

a
cleavable
fluorescent
compound
,
which
was
synthesized
in
the
present
study
to
quantify
a
small
amount
(
pmol
/
cm
(
2
)
)
of
amino
groups
on
a
solid
surface
,
revealed
that
the
protection
of
amino
groups
affected
their
surface
segregation
in
the
copolymer
coating
.

p-Toluenesulfonate
ion-complex
and
tert-butoxycarbonyl
(
Boc
)
protection
of
amino
groups
were
found
to
effectively
display
amino
groups
on
the
surface
(
more
than
70
pmol
/
cm
(
2
)
)
.

The
density
of
amino
groups
displayed
on
a
surface
can
be
easily
controlled
by
mixing
the
copolymer
and
PMMA
before
dip-coating
.

Dip-coating
of
the
copolymer
with
Boc
protection
on
various
polymeric
substrates
also
successfully
displayed
amino
groups
on
their
surfaces
.

Finally
,
we
demonstrated
that
the
amino
groups
displayed
can
be
utilized
for
the
immobilization
of
a
DNA
oligonucleotide

(
H2AK119ub1
)
and
regulates
pluripotency

(
ESCs
)
.

However
,
the
mechanisms
controlling
the
binding
of
PRC1
to
genomic
sites
and
its
catalytic
activity
are
poorly
understood
.

Here
,
we
show
that
Fbxl10
interacts
with
Ring1B
and
Nspc1
,
forming
a
noncanonical
PRC1
that
is
required
for
H2AK119ub1
in
mouse
ESCs
.

Genome-wide
analyses
reveal
that
Fbxl10
preferentially
binds
to
CpG
islands
and
colocalizes
with
Ring1B
on
Polycomb
target
genes
.

Notably
,
Fbxl10
depletion
causes
a
decrease
in
Ring1B
binding
to
target
genes
and
a
major
loss
of
H2AK119ub1
.

Furthermore
,
genetic
analyses
demonstrate
that
Fbxl10
DNA
binding
capability
and
integration
into
PRC1
are
required
for
H2AK119
ubiquitylation
.

ESCs
lacking
Fbxl10
,
like
previously
characterized
Polycomb
mutants
,
cannot
differentiate
properly
.

These
results
demonstrate
that
Fbxl10
has
a
key
role
in
regulating
Ring1B
recruitment
to
its
target
genes
and
H2AK119
ubiquitylation
in
ESCs
.
Considerable
evidence
indicates
that
serotonergic
mechanisms
,
particularly
the
serotonin
transporter
(
5HTT
)
,
may
mediate
central
effects
of
cocaine
and
may
also
be
involved
in
impulsive
and
aggressive
behavior
.

We
investigated
whether
polymorphisms
in
the
5HTT
gene
were
related
to
traits
of
impulsivity
,
sensation
seeking
,
and
aggression
among
cocaine
abusers
.

Standardized
measures
of
these
personality
traits
were
obtained
in
a
sample
of
105
severely
affected
cocaine-dependent
African-American
subjects
and
44
African-American
controls
.

Two
polymorphisms
of
the
5HTT
gene
were
examined
involving
the
5'
promoter
(
5HTTLPR
)
region
and
a
17
base
pair
variable-number-tandem-repeat
(
VNTR
)
marker
among
cocaine
patients
.

No
significant
relationships
were
observed
between
polymorphic
variants
of
the
5HTTLPR
and
VNTR
regions
and
scores
on
any
of
the
trait
measures
.

Similarly
,
demographic
variables
and
measures
of
severity
of
substance
use
and
depression
were
unrelated
to
allele
frequencies
or
genotype
distributions
of
the
variants
among
cocaine
patients
.

As
expected
,
cocaine
patients
scored
significantly
higher
on
total
scores
of
impulsivity
,
aggression
,
and
sensation
seeking
compared
to
controls
.

The
findings
do
not
seem
to
support
an
association
between
these
polymorphisms
in
the
5HTT
gene
and
impulsive-aggressive
traits
among
cocaine-dependent
African-American
individuals
.

Recent
evidence
suggests
that
the
dopamine
D4
receptor
may
play
a
role
in
schizophrenia
,
and
that
the
atypical
properties
of
the
antipsychotic
clozapine
may
be
attributable
in
part
to
its
antagonistic
actions
at
this
receptor
.

In
the
present
study
,
clozapine
and
three
other
compounds
having
D4
dopamine
receptor
antagonist
properties
were
examined
for
their
effectiveness
in
reducing
losses
in
prepulse
inhibition
(
PPI
)
induced
in
rats
by
the
dopamine
receptor
agonist
apomorphine
.

Previously
,
activity
in
the
PPI
model
has
been
shown
to
correlate
highly
with
the
antipsychotic
potency
of
a
number
of
neuroleptics
.

As
previously
reported
,
clozapine
(
1-5
.
6
mg
/
kg
)
significantly
reduced
apomorphine-induced
PPI
deficits
.

The
three
D4-selective
compounds
,
CP-293
,

(
5

6-17

8
mg

3-30
mg
/
kg
)
and
L-745
,
870
(
1-10
mg
/
kg
)
,
also
significantly
blocked
the
losses
in
PPI
produced
by
apomorphine
.

Taken
together
,
these
results
suggest
that
dopamine
receptor
antagonists
with
selectivity
for
the
D4
dopamine
receptor
subtype
may
be
effective
in
the
treatment
of
schizophrenia
,
while
being
less
likely
to
produce
dyskinesias
associated
with
D2
receptor
antagonists
.

present
study
evaluated

The
mechanism

inhibition
was
evaluated
using

.

To
eliminate
the
interaction
of
bupropion
with
DAT

NET
,
nomifensine
or
desipramine
,
respectively
,
was
included
in
the

elicited

at
bupropion
concentrations

below
those
eliciting

Results
from

analyses
suggest
that
bupropion
competitively
inhibits

,
whereas

Thus
,
bupropion
acts
as
an

nAChRs
in
rat
striatum
and

,
respectively
,
across
the

that
inhibits

.

The
combination
of

and

produced
by
bupropion
may
contribute
to
its
clinical
efficacy

Determination
of
homocysteine
levels
in
cells
and
serum
is
important
because
high
homocysteine
is
a
risk
factor
for
cardiovascular
disease
.

The
currently
used
methods
for
homocysteine
analysis
either
are
time
consuming
or
rely
on
the
use
of
expensive
equipment
.

Described
in
this
study
is
an
enzymatic
assay
that
determines
levels
of
homocysteine
in
multiple
samples
in
less
than
30
min
at
levels
from
5
to
50
pmol
using
only
a
spectrophotometer
.

The
reproducibility
of
the
assay
is
consistent
with
the
other
methods
currently
used
.

A
second
assay
,
that
is
about
5-fold
more
sensitive
,
follows
the
enzymatic
catalyzed
solvent
exchange
of
protons
on
glycine
,
which
requires
a
scintillation
counter
.

Both
the
spectrophotometric
and
the
radiometric
methods
are
based
on
the
conversion
of
5-methyltetrahydrofolate
to
tetrahydrofolate
by
methionine
synthase
.

The
tetrahydrofolate
is
formed
in
stoichiometric
amounts
to
the
homocysteine
in
the
sample
.

In
the
spectrophotometric
method
the
tetrahydrofolate
is
used
at
catalytic
levels
by
three
enzymes
to
form
a
metabolic
cycle
that
generates
NADPH
from
NADP
(
+
)
.

In
the
radiometric
assay
tetrahydrofolate
is
required
for
the
enzymatic
exchange
of
the
pro
2S
proton
of
glycine
with
solvent
.

L-Cysteine
,
at
levels
more
than
30-fold
higher
than
the
upper
level
of
homocysteine
used
in
these
assays
,
does
not
give
any
measurable
response
.
Drospirenone

,
15

,
16
beta-dimethylen-3-oxo-17
alpha-pregn-4-ene-21
,
17-carbolactone
)
is
a
novel
progestogen
under
clinical
development
.

Drospirenone
is
characterized
by
an
innovative
pharmacodynamic
profile
which
is
very
closely
related
to
that
of
progesterone
.

Potential
applications
include
oral
contraception
,
hormone
replacement
therapy
and
treatment
of
hormonal
disorders
.

The
pharmacological
properties
of
drospirenone
were
investigated
in
vitro
by
receptor
binding
and
transactivation
experiments
and
in
vivo
in
appropriate
animal
models
.

In
qualitative
agreement
with
progesterone
,
the
compound
binds
strongly
to
the
progesterone
and
the
mineralocorticoid
receptor
and
with
lower
affinity
to
androgen
and
glucocorticoid
receptors
.

There
is
no
detectable
binding
to
the
estrogen
receptor
.

Steroid
hormone
agonistic
and
antagonistic
activities
of
progesterone
and
drospirenone
were
compared
in
transactivation
experiments
.

Individual
steroid
hormone
receptors
were
artificially
expressed
together
with
a
reporter
gene
in
appropriate
cell
lines
.

Both
hormones
were
unable
to
induce
any
androgen
receptor-mediated
agonistic
activity
.

Rather
,
both
progesterone
and
drospirenone
distinctly
antagonized
androgen-stimulated
transcriptional
activation
.

Likewise
,
both
compounds
only
very
weakly
activated
the
mineralocorticoid
receptor
but
showed
potent
aldosterone
antagonistic
activity
.

Drospirenone
did
not
induce
glucocorticoid
receptor-driven
transactivation
.

Progesterone
was
a
weak
agonist
in
this
respect
.

Drospirenone
exerts
potent
progestogenic
and
antigonadotropic
activity
which
was
studied
in
various
animal
species
.

It
efficiently
promotes
the
maintenance
of
pregnancy
in
ovariectomized
rats
,
inhibits
ovulation
in
rats
and
mice
and
stimulates
endometrial
transformation
in
the
rabbit
.

Furthermore
,
drospirenone
shows
potent
antigonadotropic
,
i
.

e
.

,
testosterone-lowering
activity
in
male
cynomolgus
monkeys
.

The
progestogenic
potency
of
drospirenone
was
found
to
be
in
the
range
of
that
of
norethisterone
acetate
.

The
majority
of
clinically
used
progestogens
are
androgenic
.

Drospirenone
,
like
progesterone
,
has
no
androgenic
but
rather
an
antiandrogenic
effect
.

This
property
was
demonstrated
in
castrated
,
testosterone
propionate
substituted
male
rats
by
a
dose-dependent
inhibition
of
accessory
sex
organ
growth
(
seminal
vesicles
,
prostate
)
.

In
this
model
,
the
potency
of
drospirenone
was
about
a
third
that
of
cyproterone
acetate
.

Drospirenone
,
like
progesterone
,
shows
antimineralocorticoid
activity
,
which
causes
moderately
increased
sodium
and
water
excretion
.

This
is
an
outstanding
characteristic
which
has
not
been
described
for
any
other
synthetic
progestogen
before
.

Drospirenone
is
eight
to
ten
times
more
effective
in
this
respect
than
spironolactone
.

The
natriuretic
effect
was
demonstrable
for
at
least
three
weeks
upon
daily
treatment
of
rats
with
a
dose
of
10
mg
/
animal
.

Drospirenone
is
devoid
of
any
estrogenic
,
glucocorticoid
or
antiglucocorticoid
activity
.

In
summary
,
drospirenone
,
like
progesterone
,
combines
potent
progestogenic
with
antimineralocorticoid
and
antiandrogenic
activity
in
a
similar
dose
range
.

ABSTRACT
TRUNCATED
AT

Recently
,
we
described
the
aminothiazole
lead
(
4-biphenyl-4-ylthiazol-2-yl
)
-
(
6-methylpyridin-2-yl
)
-amine
(
1
)
,
which
exhibits
many
desirable
properties
,
including
excellent
stability
in
liver
microsomes
,
oral
bioavailability
of
∼40
%
,
and
high
exposure
in
the
brains
of
mice
.

Despite
its
good
pharmacokinetic
properties
,
compound
1
exhibited
only
modest
potency
in
mouse
neuroblastoma
cells
overexpressing
the
disease-causing
prion
protein
PrP
(
Sc
)
.

Accordingly
,
we
sought
to
identify
analogues
of
1
with
improved
antiprion
potency
in
ScN2a-cl3
cells
while
retaining
similar
or
superior
properties
.

Herein
we
report
the
discovery
of
improved
lead
compounds
such
as
(
6-methylpyridin-2-yl
)
-
[
4-
(
4-pyridin-3-yl-phenyl
)
thiazol-2-yl
]
amine
and
cyclopropanecarboxylic
acid
(
4-biphenylthiazol-2-yl
)
amide
,
which
exhibit
brain
exposure
/
EC50
ratios
at
least
tenfold
greater
than
that
of
compound
1
.
The
molecular
events
during
nongenotoxic
carcinogenesis
and
their
temporal
order
are
poorly
understood
but
thought
to
include
long-lasting
perturbations
of
gene
expression
.

Here
,
we
have
investigated
the
temporal
sequence
of
molecular
and
pathological
perturbations
at
early
stages
of
phenobarbital
(
PB
)
mediated
liver
tumor
promotion
in
vivo
.

Molecular
profiling
(
mRNA
,
microRNA
[
miRNA
]
,
DNA
methylation
,
and
proteins
)
of
mouse
liver
during
13
weeks
of
PB
treatment
revealed
progressive
increases
in
hepatic
expression
of
long
noncoding
RNAs
and
miRNAs
originating
from
the
Dlk1-Dio3
imprinted
gene
cluster
,
a
locus
that
has
recently
been
associated
with
stem
cell
pluripotency
in
mice
and
various
neoplasms
in
humans
.

PB
induction
of
the
Dlk1-Dio3
cluster
noncoding
RNA
(
ncRNA
)
Meg3
was
localized
to
glutamine
synthetase-positive
hypertrophic
perivenous
hepatocytes
,
suggesting
a
role
for
β-catenin
signaling
in
the
dysregulation
of
Dlk1-Dio3
ncRNAs
.

The
carcinogenic
relevance
of
Dlk1-Dio3
locus
ncRNA
induction
was
further
supported
by
in
vivo
genetic
dependence
on
constitutive
androstane
receptor
and
β-catenin
pathways
.

Our
data
identify
Dlk1-Dio3
ncRNAs
as
novel
candidate
early
biomarkers
for
mouse
liver
tumor
promotion
and
provide
new
opportunities
for
assessing
the
carcinogenic
potential
of
novel
compounds
.

Minocycline

)
.

We
studied
whether
minocycline
and
doxycycline
,
another
tetracycline
derivative
,
provide
protection
in
permanent
MCAO
.

Because
minocycline
inhibits
matrix
metalloprotease-9
(
MMP-9
)
,
we
also
compared
minocycline's
protective
effect
in
wild
type
(
wt
)
and
MMP-9
knock-out
(
ko
)
mice
.

mice
were
subjected
to
24-
or
72-hour
permanent
MCAO
.

Drug
administration
was
started
either
12
hours
before
or
2
hours
after
the
onset
of
MCAO
.

Infarct
size
was
determined
by
triphenyltetrazolium
staining
or
T2-weighted
MRI
.

Zymography
was
used
to
study
the
expression
of
MMPs
.

In
wt
strains
,
tetracycline
treatments
started
before
MCAO
reduced
the
infarct
size
by
25%
to
50%
,
whereas
the
treatment
started
after
MCAO
was
not
protective
.

Minocycline
inhibited
ischemia-provoked
pro-MMP-9
induction
in
wt
mice
,
but
was
not
protective
in
MMP-9
ko
mice
.

Pro-MMP-2
was
induced
by
MCAO
in
wt
and
MMP-9
ko
mice
.

MCAO-induced
pro-MMP-2
was
downregulated
by
minocycline
treatment
in
wt
mice
but
remained
in
MMP-9
ko
mice
at
the
same
level
as
in
saline-treated
wt
mice
.

Tetracyclines
are
protective
in
permanent
MCAO
when
the
treatment
is
started
before
the
insult
.

Minocycline
may
provide
protection
by
interfering

Activation
of
β-cell
EphA5
receptors
by
its
ligand
ephrinA5
from
adjacent
β-cells
has
been
reported
to
decrease
insulin
secretion
during
hypoglycemia
.

Given
the
similarities
between
islet
and
ventromedial
hypothalamus
(
VMH
)
glucose
sensing
,
we
tested
the
hypothesis
that
the
EphA5
/
ephrinA5
system
might
function
within
the
VMH
during
hypoglycemia
to
stimulate
counterregulatory
hormone
release
as
well
.

Counterregulatory
responses
and
glutamine
/
glutamate
concentrations
in
the
VMH
were
assessed
during
a
hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemic
glucose
clamp
study
in
chronically
catheterized
awake
male
Sprague-Dawley
rats
that
received
an
acute
VMH
microinjection
of
ephrinA5-Fc
,
chronic
VMH
knockdown
,
or
overexpression
of
ephrinA5
using
an
adenoassociated
viral
construct
.

Local
stimulation
of
VMH
EphA5
receptors
by
ephrinA5-Fc
or
ephrinA5
overexpression
increased
,
whereas
knockdown
of
VMH
ephrinA5
reduced
counterregulatory
responses
during
hypoglycemia
.

Overexpression
of
VMH
ephrinA5
transiently
increased
local
glutamate
concentrations
,
whereas
ephrinA5
knockdown
produced
profound
suppression
of
VMH
interstitial
fluid
glutamine
concentrations
in
the
basal
state
and
during
hypoglycemia
.

Changes
in
ephrinA5
/
EphA5
interactions
within
the
VMH
,
a
key
brain
glucose-sensing
region
,
act
in
concert
with
islets
to
restore
glucose
homeostasis
during
acute
hypoglycemia
,
and
its
effect
on
counterregulation
may
be
mediated
by
changes
in
glutamate
/
glutamine
cycling
.
Dual
antithrombotic
agents
acting
as
anticoagulants
and
aggregation
inhibitors
could
have
substantial
advantages
over
currently
prescribed
combinations
of
antithrombotic
drugs
.

Herein
,
we
report
compounds
with
moderate
inhibitory
activity
for
factor
Xa
and
fibrinogen
GPIIb
/
IIIa
binding
(
both
in
the
micromolar
range
)
.

These
compounds
resulted
from
our
efforts
to
merge
the
pharmacophores
of
selective
factor
Xa
inhibitor
rivaroxaban
with
a
mimic
of
the
Arg-Gly-Asp
(
RGD
)
sequence
of
fibrinogen
to
obtain
designed
multiple
ligands
with
potential
antithrombotic
activity
.

Resulting
from
this
study

novel
class
of
submicromolar

GPIIb
/

Intermittent
PTH
is
the
major
anabolic
therapy
for
osteoporosis
while
continuous
PTH
causes
bone
loss
.

PTH
acts
on
the
osteoblast
(
OB
)
lineage
to
regulate
bone
resorption
and
formation
.

PTH
also
induces
cyclooxygenase-2
(
COX-2
)
,
producing
prostaglandin
E2
(
PGE2
)
,
that
can
act
on
both
OBs
and
osteoclasts
(
OCs
)
.

Because
intermittent
PTH
is
more
anabolic
in
Cox-2
knockout
(
KO
)
than
wild
type
(
WT
)
mice
,
we
hypothesized
COX-2
might
contribute
to
the
effects
of
continuous
PTH
by
suppressing
PTH-stimulated
differentiation
of
mesenchymal
stem
cells
into
OBs
.

We
compared
effects
of
continuous
PTH
on
bone
marrow
stromal
cells
(
BMSCs
)
and
primary
OBs
(
POBs
)
from
Cox-2
KO
mice
,
mice
with
deletion
of
PGE2
receptors
(
Ptger4
and
Ptger2
KO
mice
)
,
and
WT
controls
.

PTH
increased
OB
differentiation
in
BMSCs
only
in
the
absence
of
COX-2
expression
or
activity
.

In
the
absence
of
COX-2
,
PTH
stimulated
differentiation
if
added
during
the
first
week
of
culture
.

In
Cox-2
KO
BMSCs
,
PTH-stimulated
differentiation
was
prevented
by
adding
PGE2
to
cultures
.

Co-culture
of
POBs
with
M-CSF-expanded
bone
marrow
macrophages
(
BMMs
)
showed
that
the
inhibition
of
PTH-stimulated
OB
differentiation
required
not
only
COX-2
or
PGE2
but
also
BMMs
.

Sufficient
PGE2
to
mediate
the
inhibitory
effect
was
made
by
either
WT
POBs
or
WT
BMMs
.

The
inhibitory
effect
mediated
by
COX-2
/
PGE2
was
transferred
by
conditioned
media
from
RANKL-treated
BMMs
and
could
be
blocked
by
osteoprotegerin
,
which
interferes
with
RANKL
binding
to
its
receptor
on
OC
lineage
cells
.

Deletion
of
Ptger4
,
but
not
Ptger2
,
in
BMMs
prevented
the
inhibition
of
PTH-stimulated
OB
differentiation
.

As
expected
,
PGE2
also
stimulated
OB
differentiation
,
but
when
given
in
combination
with
PTH
,
the
stimulatory
effects
of
both
were
abrogated
.

These
data
suggest
that
PGE2
,
acting
via
EP4R
on
BMMs
committed
to
the
OC
lineage
,
stimulated
secretion
of
a
factor
or
factors
that
acted
to
suppress
PTH-stimulated
OB
differentiation
.

This
suppression
of
OB
differentiation
could
contribute
to
the
bone
loss
seen
with
continuous
PTH
in
vivo
.
OBJECTIVES
:
Significant
variability
in
the
efficacy
and
toxicity
of
an
anticancer
drug
is
observed
in
cancer
patients
.

Currently
,
there
are
no
standard
tools
for
prediction
of
a
patient's
tumor
response
or
his
risk
of
adverse
events
to
chemotherapy
.

METHODS
:
We
investigate
an
association
between
polymorphisms
of
gemcitabine
metabolism-related
genes
and
its
chemosensitivity
in
vitro
using
62
human
cancer
cell
lines
of
various
origins
.

Polymorphisms
of
gemcitabine
metabolism-related
genes
of
deoxycytidine
monophosphate
deaminase
(
DCTD
)
,
deoxycytidine
kinase
(
DCK
)
and
ribonucleotide
reductase
M1
(
RRM1
)
were
evaluated
using
the
CEQ8000
Genetic
analysis
system
and
GeneDoc
software
.

Chemosensitivity
of
gemcitabine
was
expressed
as
an
IC50
using
MTT
assay
.

RESULTS
:
The
frequency
of
the
polymorphisms
was
21%
in
DCTD
315T>C
,
45
.
2%
in
RRM1
1082C>A
,
59
.
7%
in
RRM1
2455A>G
,
and
79%
in
RRM1
2464G>A
.

When
examining
the
association
between
these
polymorphisms
and
IC50
,
only
the
RRM1
2464G>A
showed
the
tendency
to
be
more
chemosensitive
to
gemcitabine
(
P
=
0
.
011
)
,
and
haplotypes
containing
2464G>A
polymorphism
also
showed
the
association
with
chemosensitivity
when
compared
to
wild-type
RRM1
(
G2464G
)
.

We
could
not
see
the
significant
differences
of
mRNA
expression
level
with
real-time
PCR
between
cell
lines
according
to
G2464A
polymorphism
.

In
oligonucleotide
microarray
73
GenBank
Accession
Number
(
69
genes
)
were
selected
which
expressed
differently
between
RRM1
wild-type
and
the
G2464A

CONCLUSIONS
:
RRM1
2464G>A
polymorphism
demonstrated
an
association
with
gemcitabine
sensitivity
,
which
needs
functional
studies
with
co-expressing
genes
and
prospective
clinical
studies
for
the
clinical
application
as
a
predictive
bio-marker
.
Supernumerary
centrosomes
and
aneuploidy
are
associated
with
a
malignant
phenotype
of
tumor
cells
.

Centrosomal
clustering
is
a
mechanism
used
by
cancer
cells
with
supernumerary
centrosomes
to
solve
the
threatening
problem
of
multipolar
spindles
.

Griseofulvin
is
an
antifungal
substance
that
interferes
with
the
microtubule
apparatus
and
inhibits
centrosomal
clustering
.

It
has
also
been
demonstrated
that
griseofulvin
inhibits
the
growth
of
tumor
cells
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
.

However
,
it
is
not
yet
known
whether
treatment
with
griseofulvin
inhibits
growth
of
adrenocortical
tumor
cells
.

We
studied
the
viability
and
antiproliferative
effects
of
griseofulvin
on
cultured
NCI-H295R
adrenocortical
carcinoma
cells
using
Wst-1-
,
BrdUrd-
,
and
[
3H
]
-thymidine
assays
.

For
the
detection
of
apoptosis
we
used
a
caspase
3
/
7
cleavage
assay
and
light
microscopy
techniques
.

We
observed
that
incubation
with
griseofulvin
for
24-48
h
leads
to
a
decrease
in
the
viability
and
proliferation
of
NCI-H295R
cells
in
a
dose-dependent
manner
.

Significant
effects
could
be
observed
after
incubation
with
griseofulvin
as
measured
by
Wst-1-
,
BrdUrd-
,
and
[
3H
]
dT-
uptake
assays
.

Apoptosis
of
NCI-H295R
cells
was
increased
in
a
dose-dependent
manner
up
to
4
.
5-fold
after
incubation
with
griseofulvin
40
μM
for
24
h
as
shown
by
caspase
3
/
7
cleavage
assay
and
light
microscopy
.

With
regard
to
new
treatment
strategies
for
adrenocortical
cancer
,
griseofulvin
,
and
possibly
other
agents
,
which
interfere
with
the
microtubule
apparatus
and
inhibit
centrosomal
clustering
,
may
turn
out
to
be
interesting
targets
for
further
research
.
Traumatic
brain
injury
(
TBI
)
evokes
an
intense
neuroinflammatory
reaction
that
is
essentially
mediated
by
activated
microglia
and
that
has
been
reported
to
act
as
a
secondary
injury
mechanism
that
further
promotes
neuronal
death
.

It
involves
the
excessive
production
of
inflammatory
cytokines
and
the
diminution
of
neuroprotective
and
neurotrophic
factors
,
such
as
the
soluble
form
alpha
of
the
amyloid
precursor
protein
(
sAPPα
)
,
generated
by
the
activity
of
α-secretases
.

Hence
,
the
aim
of
this
study
was
to
examine
the
effects
of
etazolate
,
an
α-secretase
activator
,
on
acute
and
belated
post-TBI
consequences
.

The
mouse
model
of
TBI
by
mechanical
percussion
was
used
and
injured
mice
received
either
the
vehicle
or
etazolate
at
the
dose
of
1
,
3
or
10
mg
/
kg
at
2
h
post-TBI
.

Neurological
score
,
cerebral
œdema
,
IL-1β
and
sAPPα
levels
,
microglial
activation
and
lesion
size
were
evaluated
from
6
to
24
h
post-TBI
.

Spontaneous
locomotor
activity
was
evaluated
from
48
h
to
12
weeks
post-TBI
,
memory
function
at
5
weeks
and
olfactory
bulb
lesions
at
13
weeks
post-TBI
.

A
single
administration
of
etazolate
exerted
a
dose-dependent
anti-inflammatory
and
anti-œdematous
effect
accompanied
by
lasting
memory
improvement
,
reduction
of
locomotor
hyperactivity
and
olfactory
bulb
tissue
protection
,
with
a
therapeutic
window
of
at
least
2
h
.

These
effects
were
associated
with
the
restoration
of
the
levels
of
the
sAPPα
protein
post-TBI
.

Taken
together
,
these
results
highlight
for
the
first
time
the
therapeutic
interest
of
an
α-secretase
activator
in
TBI
.

The
human
multidrug
and
toxin
extrusion
(
MATE
)
transporter
1
contributes
to
the
tissue
distribution
and
excretion
of
many
drugs
.

Inhibition
of
MATE1
may
result
in
potential
drug-drug
interactions
(
DDIs
)
and
alterations
in
drug
exposure
and
accumulation
in
various
tissues
.

The
primary
goals
of
this
project
were
to
identify
MATE1
inhibitors
with
clinical
importance
or
in
vitro
utility
and
to
elucidate
the
physicochemical
properties
that
differ
between
MATE1
and
OCT2
inhibitors
.

Using
a
fluorescence
assay
of
ASP
(
+
)
uptake
in
cells
stably
expressing
MATE1
,
over
900
prescription
drugs
were
screened
and
84
potential
MATE1
inhibitors
were
found
.

We
identified
several
MATE1
selective
inhibitors
including
four
FDA-approved
medications
that
may
be
clinically
relevant
MATE1
inhibitors
and
could
cause
a
clinical
DDI
.

In
parallel
,
a
QSAR
model
identified
distinct
molecular
properties
of
MATE1
versus
OCT2
inhibitors
and
was
used
to
screen
the
DrugBank
in
silico
library
for
new
hits
in
a
larger
chemical
space
.
Exposure
to
chronic
stress
during
developmental
periods
is
a
risk
factor
for
a
number
of
psychiatric
disorders
.

While
the
direct
effects
of
stress
exposure
have
been
studied
extensively
,
little
is
known
about
the
long-lasting
effects
and
the
interaction
with
ageing
.

The
same
holds
true
for
the
treatment
with
selective
serotonin
reuptake
inhibitors
(
SSRIs
)
,
which
have
been
shown
to
prevent
or
reverse
some
stress-induced
effects
.

Here
,
we
studied
the
direct
and
long-lasting
impact
of
chronic
social
stress
during
adolescence
and
the
impact
of
chronic
treatment
with
the
SSRI
paroxetine
in
adulthood
and
aged
animals
.

Therefore
,
male
CD1
mice
at
the
age
of
28
days
were
subjected
to
7
weeks
of
chronic
social
stress
.

Treatment
with
paroxetine
was
performed
per
os
with
a
dosage
of
20
mg
/
g
BW
.

We
were
able
to
reverse
most
of
the
effects
of
chronic
social
stress
in
adult
mice
(
4
months
old
)
and
to
some
extend
in
aged
animals
(
15
months
old
)
with
the
SSRI
treatment
.

Especially
the
regulation
of
the
HPA
axis
seems
to
be
affected
in
aged
mice
with
a
shift
to
the
use
of
vasopressin
.

Our
results
demonstrate
that
chronic
stress
exposure
and
antidepressant
treatment
at
the
end
of
the
developmental
period
can
have
a
significant
and
long-lasting
impact
,
highly
relevant
for
healthy
ageing
.
Chronic
obstructive
pulmonary
disease
(
COPD
)
is
a
major
cause
of
morbidity
and
mortality
worldwide
.

Oxidative
stress
is
an
important
mechanism
in
the
pathogenesis
of
this
disease
.

The
oxidant
/
antioxidant
imbalance
occurring
in
smokers
and
patients
with
COPD
is
well
established
.

Thus
,
therapeutic
strategies
targeting
oxidative
stress
with
pharmacological
antioxidant
agents
or
boosting
the
endogenous
levels
of
antioxidants
is
likely
to
be
beneficial
as
an
adjunctive
tool
in
the
treatment
of
COPD
patients
.

Thiol
compounts
such
as
N-acetyl-L-cysteine
(
NAC
)
,
carbocysteine
,
erdosteine
,
and
fudosteine
have
been
extensively
studied
.

Although
some
results
remain
controversial
,
NAC
and
carbocysteine
seem
to
have
beneficial
effect
in
patients
not
receiving
inhaled
corticosteroids
who
suffer
from
frequent
exacerbations
.

In
addition
,
other
antioxidants
like
superoxide
dismutase
(
SOD
)
mimetics
and
nuclear
factor-erythroid
2
related
factor
2
(
Nrf2
)
are
shown
to
decrease
markers
of
oxidative
stress
in
patients
with
emphysema
,
while
others
like
glutathione
peroxidase
(
GPx
)
mimetics
and
NO
synthase
(
iNOS
)
can
prevent
both
inflammation
and
oxidative
stress
in
clinical
trials
in
vivo
(
or
in
mouse
models
)
.

In
this
article
we
review
the
effectiveness
of
various
antioxidant
factors
in
COPD
and
their
potential
beneficial

in
the
treatment
of

RATIONALE
:
Social
defeat
stress
induces
physiological
and
behavioral
symptoms
,
including
anxiety
,
anhedonia
,
immune
deficits
,
and
altered
expression
of
key
brain
genes
.

OBJECTIVES
:
The
present
study
investigated
the
effects
of
social
defeat
stress
on
the
behaviors
and
expressions
of
Chat
,
Grp78
,
and
chop
in
the
brains
of
adult
mice
.

METHODS
:
Adult
mice
were
divided
into
susceptible
and
unsusceptible
groups
after
10
days
of
social
defeat
stress
.

In
experiment
1
,
behavioral
tests
were
conducted
,
and
brains
were
processed
for
Western
blotting
at
day
27
after
stress
.

In
experiment
2
,
social
avoidance
tests
were
conducted
,
and
brains
were
processed
for
Western
blotting
at
day
12
after
stress
.

RESULTS
:
The
results
indicate
decreased
and
increased
locomotion
and
anxiety
behavior
in
all
defeated
mice
.

Decrease
in
social
interaction
,
increased
immobility
,
and
impaired
memory
performance
were
only
observed
in
susceptible
mice
.

A
decrease
in
the
Chat
level
at
days
12
and
27
was
noted
in
the
prefrontal
cortex
(
PFC
)
,
amygdala
(
Amyg
)
,
and
dorsal
hippocampus
(
HIP
)
in
defeated
mice
.

The
expression
levels
of
Grp78
and
chop
measured
on
days
12
and
27
were
significantly
greater
in
the
Amyg
of
susceptible
mice
.

In
the
PFC
and
HIP
,
defeated
mice
displayed
different
patterns
in
the
levels
of
Grp78
and
chop
expressions
measured
on
days
12
and
27
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
The
present
study
demonstrated
that
chronic
social
defeat
stress
in
mice
produces
stress-related
behaviors
.

Different
response
patterns
were
noted
for
Grp78
and
chop
expression
among
the
groups
in
terms
of
brain
regions
and

Vitamin
A
deficiency
leads
to
focal
metaplasia
of
numerous
epithelial
tissues
with
altered
differentiation
from
columnar
(
in
general
)
to
stratified
squamous
cells
.

This
process
can
be
reversed
with
vitamin
A
repletion
.

Previously
,
we
described
a
system
of
retinoic
acid
(
RA
)
synthesis
in
the
cycling
rat
uterus
consisting
of
cellular
retinol
binding
protein
(
Crbp
)
,
epithelial
retinol
dehydrogenase
(
eRoldh
)
,
retinal
dehydrogenase
2
(
Aldh1a2
)
,
and
cellular
retinoic
acid
binding
protein
type
II
(
Crabp2
)
.

Western
blot
analysis
,
RT-PCR
,
and
immunohistochemistry
were
performed
to
test
whether
this
retinoic
acid
synthesis
system
was
also
present
in
other
vitamin
A
sensitive
tissues
.

We
found
that
combinations
of
Crbp
,
eRoldh
,
Aldh1a2
or
Aldh1a3
,
and
Crabp2
were
present
in
all
vitamin
A
sensitive
tissues
examined
.

In
the
ureter
,
while
eRoldh
was
present
,
another
short
chain
alcohol
dehydrogenase
reductase
(
possibly
Roldh
1
,
2
,
or
3
)
was
in
higher
concentration
in
the
transitional
epithelia
.

In
several
tissues
,
Crbp
,
Aldh1a2
,
and
/
or
Aldh1a3
localized
to
mesenchyme
and
/
or
epithelial
cells
,
while
eRoldh
and
Crabp2
were
expressed
only
in
epithelial
cells
.

This
suggests
that
mesenchymal-epithelial
interactions
may
be
as
important
in
the
adult
as
they
are
during
development
and
that
local
synthesis
of
RA
is
important
in
maintenance
of
these
tissues
.
The

Acetaminophen
(
APAP
)
overdose
is
a
classical
model
of
hepatocellular
necrosis;
however
,
the
involvement
of
the
Fas
receptor
in
the
pathophysiology
remains
controversial
.

Fas
receptor-deficient
(
lpr
)
and
C57BL
/
6
mice
were
treated
with
APAP
to
compare
the
mechanisms
of
hepatotoxicity
.

Lpr
mice
were
partially
protected
against
APAP
hepatotoxicity
as
indicated
by
reduced
plasma
ALT
and
GDH
levels
and
liver
necrosis
.

Hepatic
Cyp2e1
protein
,
adduct
formation
and
hepatic
glutathione
(
GSH
)
depletion
were
similar
,
demonstrating
equivalent
reactive
metabolite
generation
.

There
was
no
difference
in
cytokine
formation
or
hepatic
neutrophil
recruitment
.

Interestingly
,
hepatic
GSH
recovered
faster
in
lpr
mice
than
in
wild
type
animals
resulting
in
enhanced
detoxification
of
reactive
oxygen
species
.

Driving
the
increased
GSH
levels
,
mRNA
induction
and
protein
expression
of
glutamate-cysteine
ligase
(
gclc
)
were
higher
in
lpr
mice
.

Inducible
nitric
oxide
synthase
(
iNOS
)
mRNA
and
protein
levels
at
6h
were
significantly
lower
in
lpr
mice
,
which
correlated
with
reduced
nitrotyrosine
staining
.

Heat
shock
protein
70
(
Hsp70
)
mRNA
levels
were
substantially
higher
in
lpr
mice
after
APAP
.

Conclusion
:
Our
data
suggest
that
the
faster
recovery
of
hepatic
GSH
levels
during
oxidant
stress
and
peroxynitrite
formation
,
reduced
iNOS
expression
and
enhanced
induction
of
Hsp70
attenuated
the
susceptibility
to
APAP-induced
cell
death
in
lpr
mice
.
BACKGROUND
&
AIMS
:
Sensitization
of
Kupffer
cells
(
KCs
)
to
lipopolysaccharide
(
LPS
)
and
overproduction
of
tumor
necrosis
factor
(
TNF
)
alpha
are
critical
for
progression
of
alcoholic
liver
injury
.

Thalidomide
has
been
shown
to
suppress
TNF-alpha
production
from
macrophages
.

Accordingly
,
the
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
determine
whether
thalidomide
could
prevent
alcohol-induced
liver
injury
.

METHODS
:
Rats
were
given
ethanol
(
5
g
/
kg
body
wt
)
and
thalidomide
(
5
mg
/
kg
)
once
every
24
hours
intragastrically
.

To
assess
the
sensitization
of
Kupffer
cells
,
LPS
(
5
mg
/
kg
intravenously
)
was
administered
and
liver
histology
was
evaluated
24
hours
later
.

KCs
were
isolated
after
4
weeks
of
ethanol
treatment
and
intracellular
Ca2
+
(
[
Ca2
+
]
i
)
was
measured
using
fura-2
,
whereas
TNF-alpha
was
evaluated
by
reverse-transcription
polymerase
chain
reaction
and
enzyme-linked
immunosorbent
assay
.

CD14
was
determined
by
Western
and
fluorescence
staining
.

RESULTS
:
Treatment
with
ethanol
for
8
weeks
caused
marked
steatosis
,
necrosis
,
and
inflammation
in
the
liver
.

These
pathologic
parameters
were
diminished
markedly
by
treatment
with
thalidomide
.

In
the
4-week
ethanol
group
,
the
LPS-induced
liver
damage
was
aggravated
and
KCs
were
sensitized
to
LPS
.

Coadministration
of
thalidomide
with
ethanol
prevented
the
KC
sensitization
completely
.

Furthermore
,
thalidomide
abolished
the
LPS-induced
increase
in
CD14
expression
and
[
Ca2
+
]
i
elevation
in
KCs
.

Gut
permeability
was
increased
about
10-fold
after
4
weeks
of
ethanol
exposure
,
which
was
not
affected
by
thalidomide
.

Moreover
,
thalidomide
reduced
the
LPS-induced
TNF-alpha
production
by
KCs
by
decreasing
TNF-alpha
messenger
RNA
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
These
results
collectively
indicate
that
thalidomide
prevents
alcoholic
liver
injury
through
suppression
of
TNF-alpha
production
and
abolishment
of
KC
sensitization
.
Clinical

A
series
of
3-substituted
1
,
5-diarylpyrroles
bearing
a
nitrooxyalkyl
side
chain
linked
to
different
spacers
were
designed
.

New
classes
of
pyrrole-derived
nitrooxyalkyl
inverse
esters
,
carbonates
,
and
ethers
(
7-10
)
as
COX-2
selective
inhibitors
and
NO
donors
were
synthesized
and
are
herein
reported
.

By
taking
into
account
the
metabolic
conversion
of
nitrooxyalkyl
ethers
(
9
,
10
)
into
corresponding
alcohols
,
derivatives
17
and
18
were
also
studied
.

Nitrooxy
derivatives
showed
NO-dependent
vasorelaxing
properties
,
while
most
of
the
compounds
proved
to
be
very
potent
and
selective
COX-2
inhibitors
in
in
vitro
experimental
models
.

Further
in

studies
on
compounds
9a
,

and
17a
highlighted
good
anti-inflammatory
and

Gabapentin
is
used
in
the
treatment
of
epilepsy
and
neuropathic
pain
.

Gabapentin
has
high
and
saturable
permeability
across
the
BBB
,
but
no
mechanistic
studies
underpinning
this
process
have
been
reported
.

The
aim
of
the
current
study
was
to
investigate
the
transport
of
gabapentin
in
a
model
of
the
BBB
,
identify
the
important
drug
transporter
(
s
)
and
to
use
mathematical
modelling
to
quantify
the
processes
involved
.

A
human
brain
endothelial
cell
line
(
hCMEC
/
D3
)
was
utilised
as
an
in-vitro
model
of
the
BBB
.

Uptake
of
radiolabeled
gabapentin
into
cells
in
the
presence
of
chemical
inhibitors
,
siRNA
or
overexpressed
drug
transporters
of
interest
was
investigated
.

Gabapentin
was
demonstrated
to
be
a
LAT1
substrate
in
brain
endothelial
cells
(
LAT1-process;
Km
=
530μM
and
Vmax
=
7039pmoles
/
million
cells
/
min
versus
other-processes;
Km
=
923μM
and
Vmax
=
3656pmoles
/

/

)
and
in
transfected
HEK
293
LAT1
cells
(
LAT1-process;
Km
=
217μM
and
Vmax
=
5192pmoles
/

versus
otherprocesses;
Km
=
1546μM
and
Vmax
=
3375pmoles
/
million
cells
/
min
)
.

At
physiological
concentrations
of
gabapentin
,
LAT1
mediated
transport
was
3
or
~10-fold
higher
than
the
other
transport
processes
in
the
two
systems
,
respectively
,
demonstrating
clear
selectivity
for
gabapentin
.

In-silico
structural
homology
modelling
confirmed
that
LAT1
could
have
the
LeuT
conserved
fold
and
functions
by
the
alternative
access
mechanism
.

Mathematical
modelling
of
this
mechanism
revealed
revised
significance
of
Vmax
and
Km
so
that
a
low
Km
may
not
necessarily
imply
a
high
affinity
transport
process
.

Gabapentin
was
negative
for
OCT
like
transport
and
LAT2
activity
in
the
hCMEC
/
D3
and
OCT1
transfected
cells
.

Our
data
shows
that
gabapentin
is
a
substrate
for
the
influx
transporter
LAT1
at
therapeutic
concentrations
.

were
investigated
.

The
newly

compounds
displayed
different

profile
towards

Almost
all
the
compounds
had
strong
inhibitory
activities
against

Regarding

intestinal
α-glycosidase
,
only
analogs
with
N2-aromatic
substituents
displayed
varying
degrees
of

activities
on

and
nearly
all
compounds
showed
no
inhibition
against

studies
indicated
that
5-
(
p-toluenesulfonylamino

phthalimide
moiety
is
a
favorable
scaffold
to
exert
the
α-glucosidase

Our
previous
study
has
revealed
that
dioscin
,
a
compound
with
anti-inflammatory
,
lipid-lowering
,
anticancer
and
hepatoprotective
effects
,
may
induce
autophagy
in
hepatoma
cells
.

Autophagy
is
a
lysosomal
degradation
pathway
that
is
essential
for
cell
survival
and
tissue
homeostasis
.

In
this
study
,
the
role
of
autophagy
and
related
signaling
pathways
during
dioscin-induced
apoptosis
in
human
lung
cancer
cells
was
investigated
.

Results
from
4'-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
and
annexin-V
/
PI
double-staining
assay
showed
that
caspase-3-
and
caspase-8-dependent
,
and
dose-dependent
apoptoses
were
detected
after
a
24-h
dioscin
treatment
.

Meanwhile
,
autophagy
was
detected
as
early
as
12
h
after
an
exposure
to
low-dose
dioscin
,
as
indicated
by
an
up-regulated
expression
of
LC3-II
and
beclin-1
proteins
.

Blockade
of
autophagy
with
bafilomycin
A1
or
3-methyladenine
sensitized
the
A549
and
H1299
cells
to
apoptosis
.

Treatment
of
A549
and
H1299
cells
with
dioscin
caused
a
dose-dependent
increase
in
ERK1
/
2
and
JNK1
/
2
activity
,
accompanied
with
a
decreased
PI3K
expression
and
decreased
phosphorylation
of
Akt
and
mTOR
.

Taken
together
,
this
study
demonstrated
for
the
first
time
that
autophagy
occurred
earlier
than
apoptosis
during
dioscin-induced
human
lung
cancer
cell
line
apoptosis
.

Dioscin-induced
autophagy
via
ERK1

may
provide
a
protective

Bone
remodeling
is
affected
by
mechanical
loading
and
inflammatory
mediators
,
including
chemokines
.

The
chemokine
(
C-C
motif
)
ligand
3
(
CCL3
)
is
involved
in
bone
remodeling
by
binding
to
C-C
chemokine
receptors
1
and
5
(
CCR1
and
CCR5
)
expressed
on
osteoclasts
and
osteoblasts
.

Our
group
has
previously
demonstrated
that
CCR5
down-regulates
mechanical
loading-induced
bone
resorption
.

Thus
,
the
present
study
aimed
to
investigate
the
role
of
CCR1
and
CCL3
in
bone
remodeling
induced
by
mechanical
loading
during
orthodontic
tooth
movement
in
mice
.

Our
results
showed
that
bone
remodeling
was
significantly
decreased
in
CCL3
(
-
/
-
)
and
CCR1
(
-
/
-
)
mice
and
in
animals
treated
with
Met-RANTES
(
an
antagonist
of
CCR5
and
CCR1
)
.

mRNA

,
tumor

(
TNF-α
)
and

ratio
were
diminished
in
the
periodontium
of
CCL3
(
-
/
-
)
mice
and
in
the
group
treated
with
Met-RANTES
.

Met-RANTES
treatment
also
reduced
the
levels
of
cathepsin
K
and
metalloproteinase
13
(
MMP13
)
.

The
expression
of
the
osteoblast
markers
runt-related
transcription
factor
2
(
RUNX2
)
and
periostin
was
decreased
,
while
osteocalcin
(
OCN
)
was
augmented
in
CCL3
(
-
/
-
)
and
Met-RANTES-treated
mice
.

Altogether
,
these
findings
show
that
CCR1
is
pivotal
for
bone
remodeling
induced
by
mechanical
loading
during
orthodontic
tooth
movement
and
these
actions
depend
,
at

BACKGROUND
:
Recent
epidemiologic
and
laboratory
studies
have
suggested
that
non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory
drugs
(
NSAIDs
)
may
reduce
the
risk
of
breast
cancer
through
inhibition
of
cyclooxygenase-2
(
COX-2
)
.

METHODS
:
We
conducted
a
case-control
study
to
measure
the
association
between
selective
cox-2
inhibitors
,
particularly
celecoxib
,
rofecoxib
,
valdecoxib
and
non-specific
NSAID
subgroups
,
and
breast
cancer
risk
.

Between
2003
and
2006
,
a
total
of
18
,
368
incident
breast
cancer
cases
were
identified
in
the
Ingenix
/
Lab
Rx
insurance
database
,
which
contains
clinical
encounter
and
drug
prescription
data
.

Four
controls
per
case
were
randomly
selected
,
matched
on
age
and
time
in
database
.

Odds
ratios
(
OR
)
and
95%
confidence
intervals
(
CI
)
were
estimated
using
conditional
logistic
regression
.

RESULTS
:
Breast
cancer
risk
was
inversely
associated
with
both
non-specific
NSAID
and
selective
COX-2
inhibitor
use
.

Greater
than
12
months'
duration
of
use
of
Celecoxib
at
a
standard
dose
(
200mg
/
day
)
was
associated
with
a
16%
decrease
in
breast
cancer
risk
(
OR
=
0
.
84
,
95%
CI
=
0
.
73
,
0
.
97
)
.

We
observed
the
greatest
risk
reduction
in
association
with
>2
years
of
rofecoxib
exposure
(
OR
=
0
.
54
,
95%
CI
=
0
.
37
,
0
.
80
)
.

Acetaminophen
,
a
compound
with
less
biological
plausibility
for
chemoprevention
,
showed
no
significant
association
with
the
risk
of
developing
breast
cancer
.

CONCLUSION
:
Consistent
with
animal
models
and
laboratory
investigations
,
higher
doses
of
selective
COX-2
inhibitors
were
more
protective
against
breast
cancer
than
non-specific
NSAIDs
.

With
exposure
to
rofecoxib
,
a
selective
COX-2
inhibitor
,
breast
cancer
risk
reduction
was
appreciable
(
46%
)
,
suggesting
a
possible
role
for
selective
COX-2
inhibitors
in
breast
cancer
prophylaxis
.
Chronic
arsenic
ingestion
predisposes
to
vascular
disease
,
but
underlying
mechanisms
are
poorly
understood
.

In
the
present
study
we
have
analyzed
the
effects
of
short-term
arsenite
exposure
on
vascular
function
and
endothelium-dependent
relaxation
.

Endothelium-dependent
relaxations
,
nitric
oxide
(
NO
)
and
endothelium
derived
hyperpolarizing
factor
(
EDHF
)
-type
,
were
studied
in
rabbit
iliac
artery
and
aortic
rings
using
the
G
protein-coupled
receptor
agonist
acetylcholine
(
ACh
)
and
by
cyclopiazonic
acid
(
CPA
)
,
which
promotes
store-operated
Ca
(
2
+
)
entry
by
inhibiting
the
endothelial
SERCA
pump
.

Production
of
reactive
oxygen
species
(
ROS
)
in
the
endothelium
of
rabbit
aortic
valve
leaflets
and
endothelium-denuded
RIA
and
aortic
rings
was
assessed
by
imaging
of
dihydroethidium
.

In
the
iliac
artery
,
exposure
to
100μM
arsenite
for
30min
potentiated
EDHF-type
relaxations
evoked
by
both
CPA
and
ACh
.

Potentiation
was
prevented
by
catalase
,
the
catalase
/
superoxide
dismutase
mimetic
manganese
porphyrin
and
the
NADPH
oxidase
inhibitor
apocynin
.

By
contrast
in
aortic
rings
,
that
exhibited
negligible
EDHF-type
responses
,
endothelium-dependent
NO-mediated
relaxations
evoked
by
CPA
and
ACh
were
unaffected
by
arsenite
.

Arsenite
induced
apocynin-sensitive
increases
in
ROS
production
in
the
aortic
valve
endothelium
,
but
not
in
the
media
and
adventitia
of
the
iliac
artery
and
aorta
.

Our
results
suggest
that
arsenite
can
potentiate
EDHF-type
relaxations
via
a
mechanism
that
is
dependent
on
hydrogen
peroxide
,
thus
demonstrating
that
dismutation
of
the
superoxide
anion
generated
by
NADPH
oxidase
can
potentially
offset
loss
of
NO
bioavailability
under
conditions
of
reduced
eNOS
activity
.

By
contrast
,
selective
increases
in
endothelial
ROS
production
following
exposure
to
arsenite
failed
to
modify
relaxations
mediated
by
endogenous
NO
.
This
study
aims
to
assess
the
efficacy
and
safety
of
Rehmannia
glutinosa
acteosides
used
in
combination
with
the
angiotensin
receptor
blocker
irbesartan
to
treat
primary
chronic
glomerulonephritis
.

A
total
of
479
patients
diagnosed
with
primary
chronic
glomerulonephritis
were
recruited
from
outpatient
clinics
and
were
randomly
assigned
to
the
treatment
group
(
Rehmannia
glutinosa
acteosides
,
two
200-mg
capsules
,
bid;
and
irbesartan
,
one
150-mg
tablet
,
qd
)
or
the
control
group
(
irbesartan
,
one
150-mg
tablet
,
qd
)
.

The
primary
outcome
was
24-h
urinary
protein
.

Secondary
outcome
measures
included
blood
pressure
,
estimated
glomerular
filtration
rate
,
erythrocyturia
,
serum
alanine
aminotransferase
,
aspartate
transaminase
and
electrolytes
.

After
8
weeks
of
treatment
,
the
treatment
group
showed
a
mean
reduction
in
24-h
proteinuria
of
36
.
42%
compared
to
baseline
,
which
was
significantly
higher
than
the
mean
reduction
from
baseline
of
27
.
97%
in
the
control
group
(
P
=
0
.
0278
)
.

Adverse
drug
reactions
occurred
at
a
similarly
low
rate
in
the
treatment
group
(
0
.
4%
)
and
control
group
(
1
.
2%
,
P
=
0
.
3724
)
.

In
the
treatment
of
chronic
glomerulonephritis
,
the
combination
of
Rehmannia
glutinosa
acteosides
and
irbesartan
can
reduce
proteinuria
more
effectively
than
irbesartan
alone
.

linked
to
ImmunoGen's
anti-mitotic
agent
,
mertansine
(
a

.

The

combines
two

:
the
anti-HER2
activity
of
trastuzumab
,
and
the
targeted
intracellular
delivery
of
mertansine
,
a
tubulin

which
interferes
with
mitosis

promotes
apoptosis
.

promote

.

The
cellular
underpinnings
involving
these
signaling
molecules
to
regulate
mesangial
cell
hypertrophy
are
not
fully
understood
.

Deptor
has
recently
been
identified
as
an
mTOR
interacting
protein
and
functions
as
an
endogenous
inhibitor
of
the
kinase
activity
for
both
TORC1
and
TORC2
.

Prolonged
incubation
of
mesangial
cells
with
TGFβ
reduced
the
levels
of
deptor
concomitant
with
an
increase
in
TORC1
and
TORC2
activity
.

Sustained
TGFβ
activation
was
required
to
inhibit
association
of
deptor
with
mTOR
,
whereas
rapid
activation
had
no
effect
.

Using
the
mTOR
inhibitor
PP242
,
we
found
that
TGFβ-induced
both
early
and
sustained
activation
of
TORC1
and
TORC2
was
necessary
for
deptor
suppression
.

PP242-induced
reversal
of
deptor
suppression
by
TGFβ

decreased

to

Finally
,

.

Our
results
support
that
TGFβ-stimulated

acts
as
a

to
instill
a

Layer-by-layer
(
LBL
)
assembly
is
an
attractive
platform
for
controlled
release
of
biologics
given
its
mild
fabrication
process
and
versatility
in
coating
substrates
of
any
shape
.

Proteins
can
be
incorporated
into
LBL

by
sequentially
depositing
oppositely
charged
polyelectrolytes
,
which
self-assemble
into
nanoscale
films
on
medical
devices
or
tissue
engineering
scaffolds
.

However
,
previously
reported
LBL
platforms
often
require
the
use
of
a
few
hundred
layers
to
avoid
burst
release
,
which
hinders
their
broad
translation
due
to
the
lengthy
fabrication
process
,
cost
,
and
batch-to-batch
variability
.

Here
we
report
a
biodegradable
LBL
platform
composed
of
only
10
layers
with
tunable
protein
release
kinetics
,
which
is
an
order
of
magnitude
less
than
previously
reported
LBL
platforms
.

We
performed

,
one
cultivated
in

olive
areas
of
the
Sicily
region
,
Italy
.

Destoned
oils
obtained
by
processing
olives
with
a
destoning-based
procedure
were
compared
with
conventional
oils
.

This
innovative
technique
,
consisting
in
removing
the
stone
from
fruits
prior
to
processing
,
strongly
enhanced
the
already
high-quality
level
of
the
conventional
product
.

An
in-depth
analytical
investigation
from
2008
to
2010
showed
how
this
innovative
olive
extraction
process
led
to
an
excellent
peculiar
final
product
,
mainly
attributable
to
the
improved
biophenol
and
volatile
composition
,
as
well
as
higher
concentrations
of
the
lipophilic
and
vitamin
antioxidants
(
tocopherols
and

)
.

It
had
higher
levels
of

)
,
a
nutraceutical
compound
exerting
actions
against
COX1
and
COX2
(
cycloxygenases
)
.

Its

displayed

volatile
phytomolecules
and
also
had
higher
levels
of
green
volatiles

of

(

Its

by
the

We
have
studied
the
enantiospecificities
of
several
fungal

The
reactions
have
been
carried
out
with
pure
enzymes
and
with
an
NADPH-regenerating
system
consisting
of
glucose-6-phosphate
and
glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase
.

To
ascertain
the
regio
and
stereoselectivity
of
the
reduction
reactions
catalyzed
by
the
AKRs
,
we
have
separated
and
characterized
the
reaction
products
by
means
of
a
gas
chromatograph
equipped
with
a
chiral
column
and
coupled
to
a
mass
spectrometer
as
a
detector
.

According
to
the
regioselectivity
and
stereoselectivity
,
the
AKRs
studied
can
be
divided
in
two
groups
:
one
of
them
showed
preference
for
the
reduction
of
the
proximal
keto
group
,
resulting
in
the
S-enantiomer
of
the
corresponding
α-hydroxy
ketones
.

The
other
group
favored
the
reduction
of
the
distal
keto
group
and
yielded
the
corresponding
R-enantiomer
.

Three
of
the
AKRs
used
(
AKR1B1

GAL
the

The

binds
at

,
interacting
with
both
the
choline-binding
site
(
Trp-84
)
and
the
acyl-binding
pocket
(
Phe-288
,
Phe-290
)
.

The
tertiary
amine
group
of
GAL
does
not
interact
closely
with
Trp-84;
rather
,
the
double
bond
of
its
cyclohexene
ring
stacks
against
the
indole
ring
.

The
tertiary
amine
appears
to
make
a
non-conventional
hydrogen
bond
,
via
its
N-methyl
group
,
to
Asp-72

The
relatively
tight

to
arise
from
a
number
of
moderate

Here
,
we
investigated
the

(

)
in
the
intact

were

in

following

.

In
order
to
test
the
potentiating
effects
of
pilocarpine
(

)
,
independent
groups
of
rats
received
either
a
microinjection

,
immediately
before

20
min
after
a
sub-threshold
LTD
protocol
(

pulses
,

Hz;

)
.

Other
groups
received
either
an
infusion
of
the
selective
NMDA
receptor
antagonist
(
AP7;
10
nmol;
intra-mPFC
)
or

,
10
min
prior
to

,
or
prior
to
a
supra-threshold
LTD
protocol
(
900
pulses
,
1

.

Our
results
show
that
PILO
converts
a
transient
cortical
depression
induced
by
LFS600
into
a
robust
LTD
,
stable
for
at
least
4
h
.

When
applied
after
LFS600
,
PILO
does
not
change
either
mPFC
basal
neurotransmission
or
late

.

Our
data
also
indicate
that
NMDA
receptor
pre-activation
is
essential
to
the
muscarinic
enhancement
of
mPFC
synaptic
depression
,
since
AP7
microinjection
into
the
mPFC
blocked
the
conversion
of
transient
depression
into
long-lasting
LTD
produced
by
PILO
.

In
addition
,
AP7
effectively
blocked
the
long-lasting
LTD
induced
by
LFS900
.

Therefore
,
our
findings
suggest
that
the
glutamatergic
co-activation
of
prefrontal
neurons
is
important
for
the
effects
of
PILO
on
mPFC
synaptic
depression
,
which
could
play
an
important
role
in
the

Whereas
the

it
decreases

the

To

a

OBJECTIVES
:
Medical
treatment
of
tyrosinemia
I
relies
on
the
herbicide
NTBC
[
Orfadin
2-
(
2-nitro-4-trifluoromethylbenzoyl
)
-cyclohexane-1
,
3-dione
]
,
an
inhibitor
of
plant
and
mammalian
2-oxoacid-utilizing
dioxygenases
with
a
collective
catalytic
cycle
(
'HAG'
mechanism
)
.

We
hypothesize
that
NTBC-treated
tyrosinemia
I
is
a
human
model
for
the
pathogenic
role
of
two
major
enzymes
in
this
class
,
4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate
dioxygenase
(
4-HPPD;

)
,
essential
for
tyrosine
and
collagen
metabolism
,
respectively
.

METHODS
:
In
a
patient
with
established
tyrosinemia
I
,
we
monitored
the
in
vivo
activities
of
4-HPPD
and
P4-H
via
five
biomarkers
before
and
during
NTBC
medication
.

Hypothesis
testing
at
the
molecular
level
was
performed
by
computational
modeling
of
NTBC
binding
to
the
crystal
structure-derived
active
site
of
4-HPPD
,
and
then
relating
these
findings
to
our
experimental
results
and
to
known
P4-H
data
.

RESULTS
:
NTBC
rapidly
normalized
the
biomarkers
for
4-HPPD
activity
.

However
,
those
for
P4-H
activity
remained
uniformly
elevated
after
one
hundred
days
on
NTBC
,
the
PIIINP
biomarker
even
increasing
above
its
grossly
abnormal
,
initial
level
.

This
selective
enzyme
inhibition
despite
a
collective
catalytic
cycle
is

CONCLUSIONS
:

desirable

,
is
not
achieved
by

By
establishing
the
molecular
cause
for
this
failure
,
our
results
also
establish
a
rational
approach
to
identify
inhibitors
that
achieve
that
goal
,
either
by
joint

,
or
by

The
aim
of
this
work
was
to
examine
the
chemical
constituents
and
antioxidant
potential
of
water-soluble
fractions
from
the
commonly
consumed
vegetable
,
Allium
vineale
.

The
water-soluble
fraction
,
containing
phenolic
compounds
,
was
extracted
with
ethyl
acetate
to
obtain
flavonoids
which
were
separated
and
purified
by
repeated
column
chromatography
over
Sephadex

and
silica

.

The
isolated
compounds
were
identified
according

.

were
undertaken
and
they

PURPOSE
:
We
provide
a
comprehensive
overview
of
the
role
of
alpha1-adrenergic
receptors
(
alpha1ARs
)
as
critical
mediators
of
lower
urinary
tract
symptoms
(
LUTS
)
and
pathophysiology
in
benign
prostatic
hyperplasia
(
BPH
)
,
and
we
review
the
pharmacological
antagonists
of
alpha1ARs
.

MATERIALS
AND
METHODS
:
A
review
was
performed
of
pertinent
studies
in
the
literature
relating
to
the
pathophysiology
of
LUTS
and
BPH
,
focusing
on
the
role
of
alpha1ARs
,
and
of
clinical
trial
and
practice
data
evaluating
the
different
agents
that
inhibit
these
receptors
.

RESULTS
:
Further
characterization
of
the
alpha1AR
gene
family
indicates
that
3
receptor
subtypes
exist
in
humans
.

Their
different
distribution
between
urinary
tract
and
cardiovascular
tissues
has
provided
a
strategy
for
the
development
of
improved
therapeutic
agents
.

Since
excessive
activity
of
the
alpha1aAR
and
alpha1dAR
subtypes
appears
to
be
a
common
feature
in
symptomatic
BPH
and
alpha1aARs
are
enriched
in
prostatic
tissue
,
drugs
that
demonstrate
high
alpha1aAR
selectivity
have
attracted
attention
.

Tamsulosin
,
which
has
high
affinity
for
alpha1aAR
and
alpha1dAR
subtypes
but
not
for
alpha1bAR
,
shows
efficacy
similar
to
the
nonsubtype
selective
agents
terazosin
and
doxazosin
.

It
is
associated
with
fewer
cardiovascular
side
effects
,
although
it
has
some
ejaculatory
side
effects
.

The
nonsubtype
selective
agent
alfuzosin
also
demonstrates
efficacy
and
offers
an
enhanced
side
effect
profile
,
particularly
minimizing
hypotension
.

Other
agents
with
super
selective
specificity
for
the
alpha1aAR
subtype
are
under
investigation
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
Further
advances
in
the
treatment
of
LUTS
associated
with
BPH
may
depend
not
only
on
receptor
subtype
selectivity
,
but
also
on
other
pharmacokinetic
and
pharmacodynamic
factors
.
The
topology
of
the
second
extracellular
loop
(
ECL2
)
and
its
interaction
with
ligands
is
unique
in
each
G
protein-coupled
receptor
.

When
the
orthosteric
ligand
pocket
located
in
the
transmembrane
(
TM
)
domain
is
occupied
,
ligand-specific
conformational
changes
occur
in
the
ECL2
.

In
more
than
90%
of
G
protein-coupled
receptors
,
ECL2
is
tethered
to
the
third
TM
helix
via
a
disulfide
bond
.

Therefore
,
understanding
the
extent
to
which
the
TM
domain
and
ECL2
conformations
are
coupled
is
useful
.

To
investigate
this
,
we
examined
conformational
changes
in
ECL2
of
the
angiotensin
II
type
1
receptor
(
AT1R
)
by
introducing
mutations
in
distant
sites
that
alter
the
activation
state
equilibrium
of
the
AT1R
.

Differential
accessibility
of
reporter
cysteines
introduced
at
four
conformation-sensitive
sites
in
ECL2
of
these
mutants
was
measured
.

Binding
of
the
agonist
angiotensin
II
(
AngII
)
and
inverse
agonist
losartan
in
wild-type
AT1R
changed
the
accessibility
of
reporter
cysteines
,
and
the
pattern
was
consistent
with
ligand-specific
"lid"
conformations
of
ECL2
.

Without
agonist
stimulation
,
the
ECL2
in
the
gain
of
function
mutant
N111G
assumed
a
lid
conformation
similar
to
AngII-bound
wild-type
AT1R
.

In
the
presence
of
inverse
agonists
,
the
conformation
of
ECL2
in
the
N111G
mutant
was
similar
to
the
inactive
state
of
wild-type
AT1R
.

In
contrast
,
AngII
did
not
induce
a
lid
conformation
in
ECL2
in
the
loss
of
function
D281A
mutant
,
which
is
consistent
with
the
reduced
AngII
binding
affinity
in
this
mutant
.

However
,
a
lid
conformation
was
induced
by
[
Sar
(
1
)
,
Gln
(
2
)
,
Ile
(
8
)
]
AngII
,
a
specific
analog
that
binds
to
the
D281A
mutant
with
better
affinity
than
AngII
.

These
results
provide
evidence
for
the
emerging
paradigm
of
domain
coupling
facilitated
by
long
range
interactions
at
distant
sites
on
the
same
receptor

For
many
years
,
dietary
arginine
supplementation
,
often
combined
with
other
substances
,
has
been
used
as
a
mechanism
to
boost
the
immune
system
.

Considerable
controversy
,
however
,
exists
as
to
the
benefits
and
indications
of
dietary
arginine
due
in
part
to
a
poor
understanding
of
the
role
played
by
this
amino
acid
in
maintaining
immune
function
.

Emerging
knowledge
promises
to
clear
this
controversy
and
allow
for
arginine's
safe
use
.

In
myeloid
cells
,
arginine
is
mainly
metabolized
either
by
inducible
nitric
oxide
(
NO
)
synthases
(
iNOS
)
or
by
arginase
1
,
enzymes
that
are
stimulated
by
T
helper
1
or
2
cytokines
,
respectively
.

Thus
,
activation
of
iNOS
or
arginase
(
or
both
)
reflects
the
type
of
inflammatory
response
in
a
specific
disease
process
.

Myeloid
suppressor
cells
(
MSC
)
expressing
arginase
have
been
described
in
trauma
(
in
both
mice
and
humans
)
,
intra-abdominal
sepsis
,
certain
infections
,
and
prominently
,
cancer
.

Myeloid
cells
expressing
arginase
have
been
shown
to
accumulate
in
patients
with
cancer
.

Arginase
1
expression
is
also
detected
in
mononuclear
cells
after
trauma
or
surgery
.

MSC
efficiently
deplete
arginine
and
generate
ornithine
.

Through
arginine
depletion
,
MSC
may
control
NO
production
and
regulate
other
arginine-dependent
biological
processes
.

Low
circulating
arginine
has
been
documented
in
trauma
and
cancer
,
suggesting
that
MSC
may
exert
a
systemic
effect
and
cause
a
state
of
arginine
deficiency
.

Simultaneously
,
T
lymphocytes
depend
on
arginine
for
proliferation
,
zeta-chain
peptide
and
T-cell
receptor
complex
expression
,
and
the
development
of
memory
.

T-cells
cocultured
with
MSC
exhibit
the
molecular
and
functional
effects
associated
with
arginine
deficiency
.

Not
surprisingly
,
T-cell
abnormalities
,
including
decreased
proliferation
and
loss
of
the
zeta-chain
,
are
observed
in
cancer
and
after
trauma
.

Phenytoin
and
carbamazepine
are
effective
and
inexpensive
anti-epileptic
drugs
(
AEDs
)
.

As
with
many
AEDs
,
a
broad
range
of
doses
is
used
,
with
the
final
"maintenance"
dose
normally
determined
by
trial
and
error
.

Although
many
genes
could
influence
response
to
these
medicines
,
there
are
obvious
candidates
.

Both
drugs
target
the
alpha-subunit
of
the
sodium
channel
,
encoded
by
the
SCN
family
of
genes
.

Phenytoin
is
principally
metabolized
by
CYP2C9
,
and
both
are
probable
substrates
of
the
drug
transporter
P-glycoprotein
.

We
therefore
assessed
whether
variation
in
these
genes
associates
with
the
clinical
use
of
carbamazepine
and
phenytoin
in
cohorts
of
425
and
281
patients
,
respectively
.

We
report
that
a
known
functional
polymorphism
in
CYP2C9
is
highly
associated
with
the
maximum
dose
of
phenytoin
(
P
=
0
.
0066
)
.

We
also
show
that
an
intronic
polymorphism
in
the
SCN1A
gene
shows
significant
association
with
maximum
doses
in
regular
usage
of
both
carbamazepine
and
phenytoin
(
P
=
0
.
0051
and
P
=
0
.
014
,
respectively
)
.

This
polymorphism
disrupts
the
consensus
sequence
of
the
5'
splice
donor
site
of
a
highly
conserved
alternative
exon
(
5N
)
,
and
it
significantly
affects
the
proportions
of
the
alternative
transcripts
in
individuals
with
a
history
of
epilepsy
.

These
results
provide
evidence
of
a
drug
target
polymorphism
associated
with
the
clinical
use
of
AEDs
and
set
the
stage
for
a
prospective
evaluation
of

appear
to
account

has
resulted
in

,

.

Tazorac

Discovery
of

,
revealed
that

discovery
of
novel
retinoids
along

Numerous
studies
have
shown
that
resveratrol
(
RES
)
exerts
anti-inflammatory
effects
but
human
trials
evidencing
these
effects
in
vivo
are
limited
.

Furthermore
,
the
molecular
mechanisms
triggered
in
humans
following
the
oral
intake
of
RES
are
not
yet
understood
.

Therefore
,
the
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
investigate
the
molecular
changes
in
peripheral
blood
mononuclear
cells
(
PBMCs
)
associated
to
the
one-year
daily
intake
of
a
RES
enriched
(
8mg
)
grape
extract
(
GE-RES
)
in
hypertensive
male
patients
with
type
2
diabetes
mellitus
(
T2DM
)
.

We
used
microarrays
and
RT-PCR
to
analyze
expression
changes
in
genes
and
microRNAs
(
miRs
)
involved
in
the
inflammatory
response
modulated
by
the
consumption
of
GE-RES
in
comparison
to
a
placebo
and
GE
lacking
RES
.

We
also
examined
the
changes
in
several
serobiochemical
variables
,
inflammatory
and
fibrinolytic
markers
.

Our
results
showed
that
supplementation
with
GE
or
GE-RES
did
not
affect
body
weight
,
blood
pressure
,
glucose
,
HbA1c
or
lipids
,
beyond
the
values
regulated
by
gold
standard
medication
in
these
patients
.

We
did
not
find
either
any
significant
change
on
serum
inflammatory
markers
except
for
a
significant
reduction
of
ALP
and
IL-6
levels
.

The
expression
of
the
pro-inflammatory
cytokines
CCL3
,
IL-1β
and
TNF-α
was
significantly
reduced
and
that
of
the
transcriptional
repressor
LRRFIP-1
increased
in
PBMCs
from
patients
taking
the
GE-RES
extract
.

Also
,
a
group
of
miRs
involved
in
the
regulation
of
the
inflammatory
response
:
miR-21
,
miR-181b
,
miR-663
,
miR-30c2
,
miR-155
and
miR-34a
were
found
to
be
highly
correlated
and
altered
in
the
group
consuming
the
GE-RES
for
12
months
.

Our
results
provide
preliminary
evidence
that
long-term
supplementation
with
a
grape
extract
containing
RES
downregulates
the
expression
of
key
pro-inflammatory
cytokines
with
the
involvement
of
inflammation-related
miRs
in
circulating
immune
cells
of
T2DM
hypertensive
medicated
patients
and
support
a
beneficial
immunomodulatory
effect
in
these
patients
.
OBJECTIVES
:
The
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
determine
whether
continuous
infusion
of
ritodrine
could
prevent
preterm
delivery
in
sheep
.

STUDY
DESIGN
:
Sheep
in
preterm
labor
induced
by
RU
486
(
mifepristone
)
received
infusions
of
either
ritodrine
(
n
=
5
)
or
saline
solution
(
n
=
5
)
,
and
the
progress
of
labor
was
monitored
.

beta
2-Adrenergic
receptor
density
and
function
(
agonist-induced
cyclic
adenosine
monophosphate
production
)
was
measured
in
myometrial
samples
from
both
groups
.

RESULTS
:
Ritodrine
initially
inhibited
labor
contractions
.

This
inhibition
was
only
maintained
for
16
hours
,
after
which
both
the
amplitude
and
frequency
of
electromyographic
bursts
and
contractions
returned
.

The
failure
of
the
myometrium
to
respond
to
ritodrine
(
desensitization
)
was
associated
with
significant
reductions
in
agonist-induced
cyclic
adenosine
monophosphate
production
and
beta
2-adrenergic
receptor
concentration
in
myometrial
tissue
collected
from
these
animals
compared
with
the
saline
solution-treated
controls
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
Continuous
infusion
of
ritodrine
to
sheep
in
preterm
labor
produces
only
a
transient
inhibition
of
contractions
.

This
desensitization
is
caused
by
a

BACKGROUND
&
AIMS
:
Of
the
2
genes
(
MAT1A
,
MAT2A
)
encoding
methionine
adenosyltransferase
,
the
enzyme
that
synthesizes
S-adenosylmethionine
,
MAT1A
,
is
expressed
in
liver
,
whereas
MAT2A
is
expressed
in
extrahepatic
tissues
.

In
liver
,
MAT2A
expression
associates
with
growth
,
dedifferentiation
,
and
cancer
.

Here
,
we
identified
the
beta
subunit
as
a
regulator
of
proliferation
in
human
hepatoma
cell
lines
.

The
beta
subunit
has
been
cloned
and
shown
to
lower
the
K
(
m
)
of
methionine
adenosyltransferase
II
alpha2
(
the
MAT2A
product
)
for
methionine
and
to
render
the
enzyme
more
susceptible
to
S-adenosylmethionine
inhibition
.

METHODS
:
Methionine
adenosyltransferase
II
alpha2
and
beta
subunit
expression
was
analyzed
in
human
and
rat
liver
and
hepatoma
cell
lines
and
their
interaction
studied
in
HuH7
cells
.

beta
Subunit
expression
was
up-
and
down-regulated
in
human
hepatoma
cell
lines
and
the
effect
on
DNA
synthesis
determined
.

RESULTS
:
We
found
that
beta
subunit
is
expressed
in
rat
extrahepatic
tissues
but
not
in
normal
liver
.

In
human
liver
,
beta
subunit
expression
associates
with
cirrhosis
and
hepatoma
.

beta
Subunit
is
expressed
in
most
(
HepG2
,
PLC
,
and
Hep3B
)
but
not
all
(
HuH7
)
hepatoma
cell
lines
.

Transfection
of
beta
subunit
reduced
S-adenosylmethionine
content
and
stimulated
DNA
synthesis
in
HuH7
cells
,
whereas
down-regulation
of
beta
subunit
expression
diminished
DNA
synthesis
in
HepG2
.

The
interaction
between
methionine
adenosyltransferase
II
alpha2
and
beta
subunit
was
demonstrated
in
HuH7
cells
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
Our
findings
indicate
that
beta
subunit
associates
with
cirrhosis
and
cancer
providing
a
proliferative
advantage
in
hepatoma
cells
through
its
interaction
with
methionine
adenosyltransferase
II
alpha2
and
down-regulation
of
S-adenosylmethionine
levels
.

The
M6P
(
mannose
6-phosphate
)
/
IGF2R
(
insulin-like
growth
factor
II
receptor
)
interacts
with
a
variety
of
factors
that
impinge
on
tumour
invasion
and
metastasis
.

It
has
been
shown
that
expression
of
wild-type
M6P
/
IGF2R
reduces
the
tumorigenic
and
invasive
properties
of
receptor-deficient
SCC-VII
squamous
cell
carcinoma
cells
.

We
have
now
used
mutant
forms
of
M6P
/
IGF2R
to
assess
the
relevance
of
the
different
ligand-binding
sites
of
the
receptor
for
its
biological
activities
in
this
cellular
system
.

The
results
of
the
present
study
demonstrate
that
M6P
/
IGF2R
does
not
require
a
functional
binding
site
for
insulin-like
growth
factor
II
for
inhibition
of
anchorage-independent
growth
and
matrix
invasion
by
SCC-VII
cells
.

In
contrast
,
the
simultaneous
mutation
of
both
M6P-binding
sites
is
sufficient
to
impair
all
cellular
functions
of
the
receptor
tested
.

These
findings
highlight
that
the
interaction
between
M6P
/
IGF2R
and
M6P-modified
ligands
is
not
only
important
for
intracellular
accumulation
of
lysosomal
enzymes
and
formation
of
dense
lysosomes
,
but
is
also
crucial
for
the
ability
of
the
receptor
to
suppress
SCC-VII
growth
and
invasion
.

The
present
study
also
shows
that
some
of
the
biological
activities
of
M6P
/
IGF2R
in
SCC-VII
cells
strongly
depend
on
a
functional
M6P-binding
site
within
domain
3
,
thus
providing
further
evidence
for
the
non-redundant
cellular
functions
of
the
individual
carbohydrate-binding
domains
of
the
receptor
.
OBJECTIVE
:
Tricyclic
antidepressants
(
TCAs
)
are
one
of
the
first-line
pharmacological
treatments
against
neuropathic
pain
.

TCAs
increase
the
extracellular
concentrations
of
noradrenaline
and
serotonin
by
blocking
the
reuptake
transporters
of
these
amines
.

However
,
the
precise
downstream
mechanism
leading
to
the
therapeutic
action
remains
identified
.

In
this
work
,
we
evaluated
the
role
of
adrenergic
receptors
(
ARs
)
in
the
action
of
TCAs
.

METHODS
:
We
used
pharmacological
and
genetic
approaches
in
mice
to
study
the
role
of
ARs
in
the
antiallodynic
action
of
the
TCA
nortriptyline
.

Peripheral
neuropathy
was
induced
by
the
insertion
of
a
polyethylene
cuff
around
the
main
branch
of
the
sciatic
nerve
.

The
specific
role
of
beta
(
2
)
-AR
was
evaluated
by
studying
beta
(
2
)
-AR
(
-
/
-
)
mice
.

We
used
von
Frey
filaments
to
assess
mechanical
allodynia
.

RESULTS
:
The
antiallodynic
action
of
nortriptyline
was
not
affected
by
cotreatment
with
the
alpha
(
2
)
-AR
antagonist
yohimbine
,
the
beta
(
1
)
-AR
antagonists
atenolol
or
metoprolol
,
or
the
beta
(
3
)
-AR
antagonist
SR
59230A
.

On
the
contrary
,
the
beta-AR
antagonists
propranolol
or
sotalol
,
the
beta
(
1
)
/
beta
(
2
)
-AR
antagonists
alprenolol
or
pindolol
,
or
the
specific
beta
(
2
)
-AR
antagonist
ICI
118
,
551
blocked
the
action
of
nortriptyline
.

The
effect
of
nortriptyline
was
also
totally
absent
in
beta
(
2
)
-AR-deficient
mice
.

INTERPRETATION
:
Stimulation
of
beta
(
2
)
-AR
is
necessary
for
nortriptyline
to
exert
its
antiallodynic
action
against
neuropathic
pain
.

These
findings
provide
new
insight
into
the
mechanism
by
which
antidepressants
alleviate
neuropathic
pain
.

Our
results
also
raise
the
question
of
a
potential
incompatibility
between
beta-blockers
that
affect
beta
(
2
)
-AR
and
antidepressant
drugs
in
patients
treated
for
neuropathic
pain
.

(

)
was
found
to
be
a

inhibitor
with
moderate
PDE4B
activity
(
IC50

)
.

A
number
of
derivatives
with
a

of

and
fused

were
synthesized
.

Among
these

8-dihydro-6H-thiopyrano
[

pyrimidine

(

)
showed

inhibitory
activity
(

nM
)
.

Finally
,
N-propylacetamide
derivative
(
31b
)
was
determined
as
a
potent
inhibitor
for
both
PDE4B
(

)
and
TNF-α
production
in

Topiramate
is
a
widely
used
antiepileptic
agent
whose
mechanism
of
action
is
poorly
understood
.

The
drug
has
been
reported
to
interact
with
various
ion
channel
types
,
including
AMPA
/
kainate
receptors
.

In
whole-cell
voltage-clamp
recordings
from
principal
neurons
of
the
rat
basolateral
amygdala
,
topiramate
at
low
concentrations
(
IC50
,
approximately
0
.
5
microm
)
selectively
inhibited
pharmacologically
isolated
excitatory
synaptic
currents
mediated
by
kainate
receptors
containing
the
GluR5
subunit
.

Topiramate
also
partially
depressed
predominantly
AMPA-receptor-mediated
EPSCs
,
but
with
lower
efficacy
.

Topiramate
did
not
alter
the
degree
of
facilitation
in
paired-pulse
experiments
,
and
it
reduced
the
amplitude
of
miniature
EPSCs
without
affecting
their
frequency
,
demonstrating
that
the
block
of
synaptic
responses
occurs
postsynaptically
.

Inhibition
of
GluR5
kainate
receptors
could
represent
a
key
mechanism
underlying
the
anticonvulsant
activity
of
topiramate
.

Moreover
,
these
results
support
the
concept
that
GluR5
kainate
receptors
represent
a
novel
target

The
possibility
of
using
freshwater
Ulva
(
Chlorophyta
)
as
a
bioaccumulator
of
metals
(
Co
,
Cr
,
Cu
,
Mn
and
Zn
)
in
lake
and
river
water
was
examined
weekly
in
the
summer
of
2010
in
three
types
of
samples
:
the
water
,
the
sediment
and
the
thalli
of
Ulva
.

Samples
of
freshwater
Ulva
were
collected
from
two
aqueous
ecosystems
lie
250
km
away
from
the
basin
of
the
Baltic
Sea
and
53
km
from
each
other
.

A
flow
lake
located
in
the
centre
of
the
big
city
was
the
first
water
reservoir
(
ten
sites
)
and
second
,
the
suburban
river
(
six
sites
)
.

The
mean
metal
concentrations
in
the
Ulva
tissue
from
the
river
and
the
lake
decreased
in
the
following
order
:
Mn
>
Zn
>
Cr
>
Cu
>
Co
and
Mn
>
Cr
>
Zn
>
Cu
>
Co
,
respectively
.

Moreover
,
a
negative
and
statistically
significant
correlation
between
Mn
concentrations
in
the
Ulva
thalli
and
the
river
water
was
observed
.

Additionally
,
numerous
correlations
were
noted
between
the
different
concentrations
of
metals
within
the
Ulva
thalli
,
in
the
water
and
in
the
sediment
.

The
great
concentrations
of
Mn
and
Zn
and
the
smallest
of
Co
were
found
in
thalli
of
Ulva
,
irrespective
of
the
type
of
the
ecosystem
from
which
samples
of
algal
thalli
originated
.

Freshwater
Ulva
populations
examined
in
this
study
were
clearly
characterized
a
dozen
or
so
times
by
the
higher
Mn
and
Cr
accumulation
than
taxa
from
that
genera
coming
from
sea
ecosystems
.

The
calculated
bioconcentration
factor
confirm
the
high
potential
for
freshwater
Ulva
to
be
a
bioaccumulator
of
trace
metals
in
freshwater
ecosystems
.
The
phosphoramidate
nerve
agent
tabun
inhibits
butyrylcholinesterase
(
BChE
)
and
acetylcholinesterase
by
making
a
covalent
bond
on
the
active
site
serine
.

The
adduct
loses
an
alkyl
group
in
a
process
called
aging
.

The
mechanism
of
aging
of
the
tabun
adduct
is
controversial
.

Some
studies
claim
that
aging
proceeds
through
deamination
,
whereas
crystal
structure
studies
show
aging
by
O-dealkylation
.

Our
goal
was
to
develop
a
method
that
clearly
distinguishes
between
deamination
and
O-dealkylation
.

We
began
by
studying
the
tetraisopropyl
pyrophosphoramide
adduct
of
BChE
because
this
adduct
has
two
P-N
bonds
.

Mass
spectra
showed
that
the
P-N
bonds
were
stable
during
trypsin
digestion
at
pH
8
but
were
cleaved
during
pepsin
digestion
at
pH
2
.

The
P-N
bond
in
tabun
was
also
acid
labile
,
whereas
the
P-O
bond
was
stable
.

A
scheme
to
distinguish
aging
by
deamination
from
aging
by
O-dealkylation
was
based
on
the
acid
labile
P-N
bond
.

BChE
was
inhibited
with
Sp-
and
Rp-tabun
thiocholine
nerve
agent
model
compounds
to
make
adducts
identical
to
those
of
tabun
with
known
stereochemistry
.

After
aging
and
digestion
with
pepsin
at
pH
2
,
peptide
FGES198AGAAS
from
Sp-tabun
thiocholine
had
a
mass
of
902
.
2
m
/
z
in
negative
mode
,
indicating
that
it
had
aged
by
deamination
,
whereas
peptide
FGES198AGAAS
from
Rp-tabun
thiocholine
had
a
mass
of
874
.
2
m
/
z
in
negative
mode
,
indicating
that
it
had
aged
by
O-dealkylation
.

BChE
inhibited
by
authentic
,
racemic
tabun
yielded
both
902
.
2
and
874
.
2
m
/
z
peptides
,
indicating
that
both
stereoisomers
reacted
with
BChE
and
aged
either
by
deamination
or
dealkylation
.
Fluoxetine
,
as
a
serotonin
re-uptake
inhibitor
augments
serotonin
concentration
within
the
synapse
by
inhibiting
the
serotonin
transporter
.

The
contribution
of
amino
acids
has
also
been
shown
in
depression
.

We
hypothesized
that
fluoxetine
exerts
its
actions
at
least
in
part
by
intervening
brain
signaling
operated
by
amino
acid
transmitters
.

Therefore
the
aim
of
this
study
is
to
supply
neurochemical
evidence
that
fluoxetine
produces
changes
in
amino
acids
in
cerebrospinal
fluid
of
rats
.

Sprague-Dawley
rats
were
anesthetized
and
concentric
microdialysis
probes
were
implanted
stereotaxically
into
the
right
lateral
ventricle
.

Intraperitoneal
fluoxetine
(
2
.
5
or
5
mg
/
kg
)
or
physiological
saline
was
administered
and
the
probes
were
perfused
with
artificial
cerebrospinal
fluid
at
a
rate
of
1
mul
/
min
.

In
the
chronic
fluoxetine
group
,
the
rats
were
treated
daily
with
oral
fluoxetine
solution
or
inert
syrup
for
3
weeks
.

The
microdialysis
probes
were
placed
on
the
21st
day
and
perfused
the
next
day
.

Fluoxetine
was
ineffective
in
changing
the
cerebrospinal
fluid
GABA
levels
at
the
dose
of
2
.
5
mg
/
kg
but
produced
a
significant
increase
in
the
perfusates
following
injection
of
5
mg
/
kg
of
fluoxetine
(
P
<
0
.
05
)
.

Oral
fluoxetine
administration
(
5
mg
/
kg
)
for
21
days
also
elevated
the
CSF
GABA
levels
by
approximately
2-fold
(
P
<
0
.
05
)
.

L
:
-glutamic
acid
levels
were
not
affected
in
all
groups
.

These
neurochemical
findings
show
that
fluoxetine
,
a
selective
serotonin
re-uptake
inhibitor
affects
brain
GABA
levels
indirectly
,
and
our
results
suggest
that
acute
or
chronic
effects
may
be
involved
in
beneficial
and
/
or
adverse
effects
of
the
drug
.

relatively
resistant
to

that
stimulation
of

may
enhance

A

effect

repeated
exposure
to

4
methylenedioxymethamphetamine
(
MDMA
)
is
a
decrease
in
the
tissue
levels
of
serotonin
(
5-HT
)
.

A
variety
of
behavioural
and
neurochemical
tests
were
conducted
to
determine
whether
the
tissue
deficits
were
accompanied
by
an
increased
sensitivity
of
the
5-HT1a
autoreceptor
.

Tests
were
conducted
2
weeks
following
MDMA
exposure
(
four
injections
of
10
.
0
mg
/
kg
,
IP
,
administered
at
2-h
intervals

day
)
.

The
response
to
the
5-HT1a
agonist
,
8-OHDPAT
(
0

.
5
mg

)
,
was
assessed
using

retraction
(
LLR
)
,
hypoactivity
,
and
5-hydroxytryptophan
(
5-HTP
)
accumulation
following
decarboxylase
inhibition
.

The
8-OHDPAT
produced
a
dose-dependent
increase
in
LLR
and
hypoactivity
,
but
these
effects
were
comparable
for
MDMA
and
saline
pretreated
groups
.

MDMA
decreased
tissue
levels
of
5-HT
and
the
accumulation
of
5-HTP
,
but
these
effects
were
not
reflected
in
the
changes
in
autoreceptor
sensitivity
.

The
data
suggest
that
the
decrease
in
tissue
levels
of
5-HT
produced
by
MDMA
is
accompanied
by
a
decrease
in
tryptophan
hydroxylase
activity
but
cannot
be
explained
by
supersensitivity
of
the
5-HT1a

BACKGROUND
:
Clinical
trial
data
have
shown
that
among
breast
cancer
patients
who
were
disease
free
after
5
years
of
adjuvant
treatment
with
tamoxifen
,
further
extended
treatment
with
the
nonsteroidal
aromatase
inhibitor
letrozole
reduces
breast
cancer
recurrence
.

We
examined
the
efficacy
and
tolerability
of
extended
adjuvant
therapy
with
another
aromatase
inhibitor
,
anastrozole
,
for
3
years
among
women
who
had
completed
5
years
of
adjuvant
therapy
.

METHODS
:
Austrian

Colorectal
Cancer
Study
Group
(
ABCSG
)
Trial
6a
is
an
extension
of
ABCSG
Trial
6
,
in
which
hormone
receptor-positive
postmenopausal
patients
received
5
years
of
adjuvant
tamoxifen
,
with
or
without
the
aromatase
inhibitor
aminoglutethimide
,
for
the
first
2
years
of
therapy
.

For
ABCSG
Trial
6a
,
patients
who
were
disease
free
at
the
end
of
Trial
6
were
randomly
assigned
to
receive
either
3
years
of
anastrozole
or
no
further
treatment
.

Efficacy
data
were
analyzed
with
the
use
of
a
Cox
proportional
hazards
regression
model
with
two-sided
P
values
and
Kaplan-Meier
curves
,
and
tolerability
data
were
estimated
using
logistic
regression
analysis
with
odds
ratios
and
95%
confidence
intervals
(
CIs
)
.

RESULTS
:
ABCSG
Trial
6a
included
856
patients
.

At
a
median
follow-up
of
62
.
3
months
,
women
who
received
anastrozole
(
n
=
387
)
had
a
statistically
significantly
reduced
risk
of
recurrence
(
locoregional
recurrence
,
contralateral
breast
cancer
,
or
distant
metastasis
)
compared
with
women
who
received
no
further
treatment

.

Anastrozole
was
well
tolerated
,
and
no
unexpected
adverse
events
were
reported
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
These
data
confirm
the
benefit
of
extending
adjuvant
tamoxifen
therapy
beyond
5
years
with
anastrozole
compared
with
no
further
treatment
.

Further
research
is
required
to
define
the
optimum
length
of
extended
adjuvant
therapy
and
to
investigate
the
possibility
of
tailoring
this
period
to
suit
different
disease
types

The
effect
of
a
21-day
treatment
with
the
dual
5-HT
and
NE
reuptake
blocker
venlafaxine
(

by

)
was
assessed
on
the
time
required
for
a
50%
recovery
(
RT
(
50
)
)
of
the
firing
activity
of
dorsal
hippocampus
CA
(
3
)
pyramidal
neurons
from
the
suppression
induced
by
microiontophoretic
applications
of
5-HT
and
NE
.

The
RT
(
50
)
values
for
5-HT
were
increased
by
both
10
and
40
mg
/
kg
/
day
regimens
of
venlafaxine
,
whereas
those
for
NE
were
increased
only
by
the
40
mg
/
kg
/
day
regimen
,
indicative
of
a
greater
potency
of
venlafaxine
in
blocking
5-HT
reuptake
.

The
sensitivity
of
the
postsynaptic
5-HT
(
1A
)
and
alpha
(
2
)
-adrenergic
receptors
was
altered
by
neither
regimen
of
venlafaxine
.

Using
a
paradigm
by
which
the
5-HT
(
1A
)
antagonist
WAY
100635
can
induce
a
disinhibition
of
firing
activity
of
CA
(
3
)
pyramidal
neurons
,
it
was
demonstrated
that
the
high
,
but
not
the
low
,
dose
of
venlafaxine
led
to
an
enhanced
tonic
activation
of
postsynaptic
5-HT
(
1A
)
receptors
in
the
dorsal
hippocampus
.

The
duration
of
the
suppressant
effect
of
the
firing
activity
of
CA
(
3
)
hippocampus
pyramidal
neurons
produced
by
the
electrical
stimulation
of
the
ascending
5-HT
pathway
was
significantly
reduced
when
the
frequency
of
the
stimulation
was
enhanced
from
1
Hz
to
5
Hz
in
control
rats
and
in
rats
treated
with
10
mg
/
kg
/
day
,
but
not
with
40
mg
/
kg
/
day
of
venlafaxine
.

Hence
,
venlafaxine
induced
a
desensitization
of
the
terminal
5-HT
(
1B
)
autoreceptor
only
at
the
high
dose
.

A
2-day
treatment
with
10
mg
/
kg
/
day
of
venlafaxine
induced
a
suppression
of
the
firing
activity
of
5-HT
neurons
of
the
dorsal
raphe
.

The
firing
activity
of
these
neurons
was
back
to
control
level
in
rats
that
had
been
treated
for
21
days
with
the
same
dose
of
venlafaxine
.

The
suppressant
effect
of
the
i

v
.

administration
of
the
5-HT
autoreceptor
agonist
LSD
on
the
firing
activity
of
dorsal
raphe
5-HT
neurons
was
reduced
in
rats
that
had
been
treated
for
21
days
with
10
mg
/
kg
/
day
of
venlafaxine
.

A
2-day
treatment
with
40
mg
/
kg
/
day
of
venlafaxine
,
unlike
the
10
mg
/
kg
/
day
regimen
,
induced
a
marked
suppression
of
the
firing
activity
of
locus
coeruleus
NE
neurons
.

However
,
in
contrast
to
5-HT
neurons
,
NE
neurons
did
not
recover
their
firing
activity
after
a
21-day
treatment
.

Taken
together
,
the
results
from
this
study
indicate
that
the
low
dose
of
venlafaxine
blocked
selectively
the
reuptake
of
5-HT
,
whereas
the
high
dose
blocked
the
reuptake
of
both
5-HT
and
NE
.

Moreover
,
an
enhancement
of
serotonergic
neurotransmission
by
venlafaxine
was
only
achieved
under
conditions
whereby
the
desensitization
of
the
terminal
5-HT
(
1B
)
autoreceptor
is
appended
to
that
of
the
somatodendritic

(

receptor

A
specific
module
containing
a
conventional
PHD
finger
followed
by
an
extended
PHD
finger
exists
in
the
mammalian

protein
,
among

.

AF10
has
mostly
been
studied
in
the
context
of
the
leukemic
MLL-AF10
fusion
protein
,
which
lacks
the
N-terminal
PHD
fingers
of
AF10
.

Although
this
domain
of
AF10
is
the
most
conserved
region
of
the
protein
,
its
biological
significance
has
not
been
elucidated
.

In
this
study
,
we
used
genetic
and
biochemical
approaches
to
examine
the
PHD1-PHD2
region
of
the
Caenorhabditis
elegans
ortholog
of
AF10
,
zinc
finger
protein
1
(
ZFP-1
)
.

We
demonstrate
that
the
PHD1-PHD2
region
is
essential
for
viability
and
that
the
first
PHD
finger
contributes
to
the
preferred
binding
of
PHD1-PHD2
to
lysine
4-methylated
histone
H3
tails
.

Moreover
,
we
show
that
ZFP-1
localization
peaks
overlap
with
H3K4
methylation-enriched
promoters
of
actively
expressed
genes
genomewide
and
that
H3K4
methylation
is
important
for
ZFP-1
localization
to
promoters
in
the
embryo
.

We
predict
that
the
essential
biological
role
of
the
PHD1-PHD2
module
of
ZFP-1
/
AF10
is
connected
to
the
regulation
of

The
mechanism
(
s
)
responsible
for
arterial
vasodilation
observed
following
acute
administration
of
racemic
carvedilol
,
a
novel
vasodilator
/
beta
adrenoceptor
antagonist
,
has
been
investigated
in
rats
.

In
conscious
spontaneously
hypertensive
rats
,
carvedilol
(
0
.
03-3
.
0
mg
/
kg
,
iv
)
produced
a
dose-dependent
reduction
in
blood
pressure
with
no
significant
effect
on
heart
rate
.

Because
cardiac
output
was
relatively
unaffected
,
the
antihypertensive
response
of
carvedilol
was
associated
with
a
dose-dependent
reduction
in
total
peripheral
vascular
resistance
.

Submaximal
antihypertensive
doses
of
carvedilol
were
chosen
for
mechanism
of
action
studies
in
pithed
rats
.

Carvedilol
(
0
.
3
mg
/
kg
,
iv
)
produced
a
significant
inhibition
of
the
beta
1
adrenoceptor
mediated
positive
chronotropic
response
to
isoproterenol
.

This
same
dose
of
carvedilol
also
inhibited
,
but
to
a
lesser
degree
,
the
beta
2
adrenoceptor
mediated
vasodepressor
response
to
salbutamol
in
pithed
rats
whose
blood
pressure
was
elevated
by
a
constant
intravenous
infusion
of
angiotensin
II
.

Thus
,
carvedilol
blocks
both
beta
1
and
beta
2
adrenoceptors
at
antihypertensive
doses
,
with
modest
selectivity
being
observed
for
the
beta
1
adrenoceptor
subtype
.

Carvedilol
produced
significant
inhibition
of
the
alpha
1
adrenoceptor
mediated
pressor
response
to
cirazoline
in
the
pithed
rat
,
but
had
no
effect
on
the
alpha
2
adrenoceptor
mediated
pressor
response
to
B-HT
933
,
suggesting
that
carvedilol
is
also
an
alpha
1
adrenoceptor
antagonist
at
antihypertensive
doses
.

Carvedilol
had
no
effect
on
the
pressor
response
elicited
by
angiotensin
II
,
indicating
a
lack
of
nonspecific
vasodilator
activity
.

The
vasopressor
response
to
the
calcium
channel
activator
,
BAY-K-8644
,
which
is
mediated
through
the
opening
of
voltage
dependent
calcium
channels
and
the
subsequent
translocation
of
extracellular
calcium
,
was
significantly
inhibited
by
carvedilol
(
1
mg
/
kg
,
iv
)
,
suggesting
that
carvedilol
is
also
a
calcium
channel
antagonist
,
consistent
with
our
previous
in
vitro
studies
.

In
anesthetized
spontaneously
hypertensive
rats
,
the
antihypertensive
activity
of
carvedilol
was
nearly
abolished
by
combined
pretreatment
of
the
rats
with
high
doses
of
the
alpha
1
adrenoceptor
antagonist
,
prazosin
(
1
mg
/
kg
,
iv
)
,
and
the
nonselective
beta
adrenoceptor
antagonist
,
propranolol
(
3
mg
/
kg
,
iv
)
,
suggesting
that
the
majority
of
the
antihypertensive
response
produced
by
carvedilol
may
be
accounted
for
by
blockade
of
beta
and
alpha
1
adrenoceptors
.

We
therefore
conclude
that
carvedilol
,
at
antihypertensive
doses
,
is
an
antagonist
of
beta
1
,
beta
2
,
and
alpha
1
adrenoceptors
,
and
also
of
calcium
channels
in
vascular
smooth
muscle
.

Drug-protein

Lipoxin
A4
(
LXA4
)
has
been
described
as
an
anti-inflammatory
mediator
,
which
exerts
its
effects
through
the
formyl
peptide
receptor
FPR2
,
also
known
as
ALX
.

However
,
there
has
been
a
controversy
whether
or
not
cells
expressing
FPR2
/
ALX
,
such
as
neutrophils
,
respond
to
LXA4
.

We
,
therefore
,
systematically
examined
the
ability
of
the
human
and
murine
forms
of
the
receptor
to
respond
to
LXA4
.

We
show
that
both
receptor
orthologues
responded
to
the
FPR2
/
ALX
peptide
agonist
WKYMVM
when
expressed
heterologously
.

In
contrast
,
LXA4
from
different
sources
neither
increased
[
Ca
(
2
+
)
]
i
and
extracellular-signal-regulated
kinase
(
ERK
)
phosphorylation
,
nor
did
it
induce
a
decrease
in
cAMP
levels
or
a
translocation
of
β-arrestin
.

Also
,
several
LXA4
analogues
were
found
to
be
unable
to
signal
through
FPR2
/
ALX
.

We
conclude
that
FPR2
/
ALX
is
not
activated
by
LXA4
and
that
the
molecular
mechanism
by
which
LXA4
functions
still
needs
to
be
identified
.
Non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory
drugs
(
NSAIDs
)
are
competitive
inhibitors
of
cyclooxygenase
(
COX
)
,
the
enzyme
that
mediates
biosynthesis
of
prostaglandins
and
thromboxanes
from
arachidonic
acid
.

There
are
at
least
two
different
isoforms
of
the
enzyme
known
as
COX-1
and
-2
.

Site
directed
mutagenesis
studies
suggest
that
non-selective
COX
inhibitors
of
diverse
chemical
families
exhibit
differential
binding
modes
to
the
two
isozymes
.

These
results
cannot
clearly
be
explained
from
the
sole
analysis
of
the
crystal
structures
of
COX
available
from
X-ray
diffraction
studies
.

With
the
aim
to
elucidate
the
structural
features
governing
the
differential
inhibitory
binding
behavior
of
these
inhibitors
,
molecular
modeling
studies
were
undertaken
to
generate
atomic
models
compatible
with
the
experimental
data
available
.

Accordingly
,
docking
of
different
COX
inhibitors
,
including
selective
and
non-selective
ligands
:
rofecoxib
,
ketoprofen
,
suprofen
,
carprofen
,
zomepirac
,
indomethacin
,
diclofenac
and
meclofenamic
acid
were
undertaken
using
the
AMBER
program
.

The
results
of
the
present
study
provide
new
insights
into
a
better
understanding
of
the
differential
binding
mode
of
diverse
families
of
COX
inhibitors
,
and
are
expected
to
contribute
to
the
design
of
new
selective
compounds
.
Neuronal
nicotinic
receptors
are
ligand-gated
ion
channels
of
the
central
and
peripheral
central
nervous
system
that
regulate
synaptic
activity
from
both
pre-
and
postsynaptic
sites
.

The
present
study
establishes
the
acute
interaction
of
bupropion
,
an
antidepressant
agent
that
is
also
effective
in
nicotine
dependence
,
with
nicotine
and
nicotinic
receptors
using
different
in
vivo
and
in
vitro
tests
.

Bupropion
was
found
to
block
nicotine's
antinociception
(
in
two
tests
)
,
motor
effects
,
hypothermia
,
and
convulsive
effects
with
different
potencies
in
the
present
investigation
,
suggesting
that
bupropion
possesses
some
selectivity
for
neuronal
nicotinic
receptors
underlying
these
various
nicotinic
effects
.

In
addition
,
bupropion
blocks
nicotine
activation
of
alpha
(
3
)
beta
(
2
)
,
alpha
(
4
)
beta
(
2
)
,
and
alpha
(
7
)
neuronal
acetylcholine
nicotinic
receptors
(
nAChRs
)
with
some
degree
of
selectivity
.

It
was
approximately
50
and
12
times
more
effective
in
blocking
alpha
(
3
)
beta
(
2
)
and
alpha
(
4
)
beta
(
2
)
than
alpha
(
7
.

)
This
functional
blockade
was
noncompetitive
,
because
it
was
insurmountable
by
increasing
concentration
of
ACh
in
the
nAChRs
subtypes
tested
.

Furthermore
,
bupropion
at
high
concentration
failed
to
displace
brain
[
(
3
)
H
]
nicotine
binding
sites
,
a
site
largely
composed
of
alpha
(
4
)
beta
(
2
)
subunit
combination
.

Given
the
observation
that
bupropion
inhibition
of
alpha
(
3
)
beta
(
2
)
and
alpha
(
4
)
beta
(
2
)
receptors
exhibits
voltage-independence
properties
,
bupropion
may
not
be
acting
as
an
open
channel
blocker
.

These
effects
may
explain
in
part
bupropion's
efficacy
in
nicotine
dependence
.

Our
present
findings
suggest
that
functional
blockade
of
neuronal
nAChRs
are
useful
in
nicotine
dependence
treatment

COX-1
,
and
gene
knockout

experiments
demonstrate
a
central
role
of
COX-2
in
experimental
tumorigenesis
.

COX-2
produces
prostaglandins
that
inhibit
apoptosis
and
stimulate
angiogenesis
and
invasiveness
.

Selective
COX-2
inhibitors
reduce
prostaglandin
synthesis
,
restore
apoptosis
,
and
inhibit
cancer
cell
proliferation
.

In
animal
studies
they
limit
carcinogen-induced
tumorigenesis
.

In
contrast
,
aspirin-like
nonselective
NSAIDs
such
as
sulindac
and
indomethacin
inhibit
not
only
the
enzymatic
action
of
the
highly
inducible
,
proinflammatory
COX-2
but
the
constitutively
expressed
,
cytoprotective
COX-1
as
well
.

Consequently
,
nonselective
NSAIDs
can
cause
platelet
dysfunction
,
gastrointestinal
ulceration
,
and
kidney
damage
.

For
that
reason
,
selective
inhibition
of
COX-2
to
treat
neoplastic
proliferation
is
preferable
to
nonselective
inhibition
.

Selective

such
as
meloxicam
,
celecoxib
(

,
and

MK-0966
)
,
are
NSAIDs
that
have
been
modified
chemically
to
preferentially
inhibit
COX-2
but
not
COX-1
.

For
instance
,
meloxicam
inhibits
the
growth
of
cultured
colon

(
HCA-7
and
Moser-S

that
express

and
,
surprisingly
,
in

that
does
not
express
COX-2
.

This
effect
may
due
to
induction
of
apoptosis
through
uncoupling
of
oxidative
phosphorylation
and
down-regulation
of
Bcl-2
,
as
has
been
demonstrated
for
some
nonselective
NSAIDs
,
for
instance
,
flurbiprofen
.

In
addition
,
COX-2
is
constitutively

cells
.

These
findings
might
somewhat
limit
the
use

All
DNA
(
cytosine-5
)
-methyltransferases
contain
a
single
conserved
cysteine
.

It
has
been
proposed
that
this
cysteine
initiates
catalysis
by
attacking
the
C6
of
cytosine
and
thereby
activating
the
normally
inert
C5
position
.

We
show
here
that
substitutions
of
this
cysteine
in
the

EcoRII
with

serine

groups
to

.

Interestingly
,
mutants
with
either
serine
or
glycine
substitution
bind
tightly
to
substrate
DNA
.

These
mutants
resemble
the
wild-type
enzyme
in
that
their
binding
to
substrate
is
not
eliminated
by
the
presence
of
non-specific
DNA
in
the
reaction
,
it
is
sensitive
to
methylation
status
of
the
substrate
and
is
stimulated
by
an
analog
of
the
methyl
donor
.

Hence
the
conserved
cysteine
is
not
essential
for
the
specific
stable
binding
of
the
enzyme
to
its
substrate
.

However
,
substitution
of
the
cysteine
with
the
bulkier
tryptophan
does
reduce
DNA
binding
.

We
also
report
here
a
novel
procedure
for
the
synthesis
of

Further
,

that
a

substrate

M
.

EcoRII
in
which
the
target
cytosine

is
a
mechanism-based
inhibitor
of
the
enzyme
and
that
it
forms
an
irreversible
complex
with
the
enzyme
.

As
expected
,
this
modified
substrate
does
not
form
irreversible

Recent
data
suggest
that
the
role
of
CYP3A4
in
imatinib
metabolism
is
smaller
than
presumed
.

This
study
aimed
to
evaluate
the
quantitative
importance
of
different
cytochrome
P450
(
P450
)
enzymes
in
imatinib
pharmacokinetics
.

First
,
the
metabolism
of
imatinib
was
investigated
using
recombinant
P450
enzymes
and
human
liver
microsomes
with
P450
isoform-selective
inhibitors
.

Thereafter
,
an
in
silico
model
for
imatinib
was
constructed
to
perform
pharmacokinetic
simulations
to
assess
the
roles
of
P450
enzymes
in
imatinib
elimination
at
clinically
used
imatinib
doses
.

In
vitro
,
CYP2C8
inhibitors
and
CYP3A4
inhibitors
inhibited
the
depletion
of
0
.
1
µM
imatinib
by
45
and
80%
,
respectively
,
and
the
formation
of
the
main
metabolite
of
imatinib
,
N-desmethylimatinib
,
by
>50%
.

Likewise
,
recombinant
CYP2C8
and
CYP3A4
metabolized
imatinib
extensively
,
whereas
other
isoforms
had
minor
effect
on
imatinib
concentrations
.

In
the
beginning
of
imatinib
treatment
,
the
fractions
of
its
hepatic
clearance
mediated
by
CYP2C8
and
CYP3A4
were
predicted
to
approximate
40
and
60%
,
respectively
.

During
long-term
treatment
with
imatinib
400
mg
once
or
twice
daily
,
up
to
65
or
75%
of
its
hepatic
elimination
was
predicted
to
occur
via
CYP2C8
,
and
only
about
35
or
25%
by
CYP3A4
,
due
to
dose-
and
time-dependent
autoinactivation
of
CYP3A4
by
imatinib
.

Thus
,
although
CYP2C8
and
CYP3A4
are
the
main
enzymes
in
imatinib
metabolism
in
vitro
,
in
silico
predictions
indicate
that
imatinib
inhibits
its
own
CYP3A4-mediated
metabolism
,
assigning
a
key
role
for
CYP2C8
.

During
multiple
dosing
,
pharmacogenetic
polymorphisms
and
drug
interactions
affecting
CYP2C8
activity
may
cause
marked
interindividual
variation
in
the
exposure
and
response
to
imatinib

enzymes
types
1

It
has
been
theorized
that
an
overabundance
of
DHT
may
be
implicated
in
the
pathogenesis
of
both
benign
prostatic
hyperplasia
(
BPH
)
and
prostate
cancer
.

Inhibitors
of
5-AR
such
as
dutasteride
and
finasteride
may
therefore
have
an
important
role
in
the
prevention
and
treatment
of
BPH
and
prostate
cancer
.

Dutasteride
provides
greater
suppression
of
DHT
than
finasteride
,
thereby
underlying
the
hypothesis
that
inhibition
of
both
type
1
and
type
2
would
provide
correspondingly
greater
protection
than
inhibition
of
type
2
alone
.

We
review
the
potential
significance
of
the
5-AR
inhibitors
in
reducing
the
risk
of
prostate
cancer
according
to
the
basic

and
showed

Pharmacokinetic
evaluation
in

indicated
that

behaved
as

prodrug
,
immediately
converting
to
4
and
giving
an
identical
profile
to
that
of
the
parent

.

These
results
represent
the
first
description

phosphoramidic

also

,
but
the
mechanism
of
pathogenesis
of
the
encephalopathy

remains
undetermined
.

HHH

was
diagnosed
in
a
2-year-old
Palestinian
boy
with
developmental
delay
and
seizures
,
and
subsequently
in
his
13-year-old
brother
with
developmental
delay
.

Direct
sequencing
of
the
PCR
products
of
SLC25A15
exon
amplifications
revealed
that
both
brothers
were
homozygous
for
a
novel
446G
deletion
in
exon
3
as
well
as
for
a
760A>T
(
I254L
)
polymorphism
in
exon
5
,
which
is
downstream
of
a
premature
termination
codon
produced
by
the
frameshift
resulting
from
the
446G
deletion
.

The

patient
had
elevated
liver
enzymes
as
well
as

with
an
elevated
lactate
to
pyruvate
ratio
,
and
increased
urinary
excretion
of
lactate
,
glutarate
and
Krebs
cycle
intermediates
.

These
findings
are
indicative
of
mitochondrial
dysfunction
and
are
in
accordance
with
ultrastructural
studies
showing
increased
numbers
of
large
and
bizarre
mitochondria
in
liver
,
muscle
,
leukocytes
and
fibroblasts
of
some
HHH
patients
.

Neurologic
and
hepatic
manifestations
are
characteristic
of
some
primary
mitochondrial
disorders

Secondary
mitochondrial
dysfunction
may
contribute
to
the
pathogenesis
of
these

features
in
HHH
syndrome
.
Within
the
past
decade
,
gonadotrophin-releasing
hormone
(
GnRH
)
agonists
have
contributed
greatly
to
the
success
of
cycles
programmed
for
in-vitro
fertilization
and
embryo
transfer
.

However
,
apart
from
a
preventive
effect
on
the
luteinizing
hormone
(
LH
)
surge
,
most
of
the
beneficial
effects
of
these
molecules
are
still
only
partly
known
.

A
precise
analysis
of
regimens
using
GnRH
agonists
for
ovarian
stimulation
shows
that
many
parameters
may
interfere
with
the
outcome
of
long-term
and
short-term
protocols
.

The
great
variability
between
these
protocols
hampers
our
comprehension
of
the
mechanisms
involved
in
the
overall
clinical
improvement
seen
with
this
therapy
.

The
hypophyseal
desensitization
induced
by
GnRH
agonists
is
greatly
dependent
on
the
dose
and
duration
of
their
administration
,
but
the
residual
gonadotrophin
secretion
is
imperfectly
estimated
by
hormonal
measurements
using
radioimmunometric
assays
.

Moreover
,
the
specific
role
of
GnRH
agonist-induced
ovarian
quiescence
on
subsequent
ovarian
responsiveness
to
gonadotrophins
and
on
endometrial
receptivity
deserves
further
investigation
.

Finally
,
a
direct
ovarian
action
of
GnRH
agonists
on
steroidogenesis
,
folliculogenesis
and
embryo
quality
is
still
controversial
in
humans
.

These
putative
deleterious
effects
of
GnRH
agonists
have
led
some
authors
to
recommend
a
reduction
of
both
dose
and
duration
of
GnRH
agonist
administration
for
women
identified
by
a
poor
response
to
gonadotrophins
.

Using
this
approach
,
a
few
reports
have
recently
shown
some
clinical
advantages
for
ovarian
responsiveness
but
no
convincing
evidence
for
any
improvement
in
pregnancy
rate
.

It
thus
appears
that
the
overall
impact
of
GnRH
agonists
on
reproductive
function
is
still
partly
misunderstood
.

Despite

the

were
significantly
lower
in

Thus
,
these

that
irrespective

as
a

,
through
regulating
the

,
the

At

mV
,
succinate

,
whereas

(

and

did
not
.

The
cis-dicarboxylate
maleate
produced
currents
smaller

showed

currents
.

The

dicarboxylates
glutarate

produced
larger

failed
to
cause

.

For

,
the

Except
for

to
those
associated
with

.

The

The
human
telomeric
protein
TRF2
is
required
to
protect
chromosome
ends
by
facilitating
their
organization
into
the
protective
capping
structure
.

Post-translational
modifications
of
TRF2
such
as
phosphorylation
,
ubiquitination
,
SUMOylation
,
methylation
and
poly
(
ADP-ribosyl
)
ation
have
been
shown
to
play
important
roles
in
telomere
function
.

Here
we
show
that
TRF2
specifically
interacts
with
the
histone
acetyltransferase
p300
,
and
that
p300
acetylates
the
lysine
residue
at
position
293
of
TRF2
.

We
also
report
that
p300-mediated
acetylation
stabilizes
the
TRF2
protein
by
inhibiting
its
ubiquitin-dependent
proteolysis
and
is
required
for
efficient
telomere
binding
of
TRF2
.

Furthermore
,
overexpression
of
the
acetylation-deficient
mutant
,
K293R
,
induces
DNA-damage
response
foci
at
telomeres
,
thereby
leading
to
induction
of
impaired
cell
growth
,
cellular
senescence
and
altered
cell
cycle
distribution
.

A
small
but
significant
number
of
metaphase
chromosomes
show
no
telomeric
signals
at
chromatid
ends
,
suggesting
an
aberrant
telomere
structure
.

These
findings
demonstrate
that
acetylation
of
TRF2
by
p300
plays
a
crucial
role
in
the
maintenance
of
functional
telomeres
as
well
as
in
the
regulation
of
the
telomere-associated
DNA-damage
response
,
thus
providing
a
new
route
for
modulating
telomere
protection
function
.
OBJECTIVE
:
To
determine
the
type
of
mutation
in
a
patient
with
clinical
diagnosis
of
suspected
APRT
deficiency
.

DESIGN
AND
METHODS
:
A
51-year-old
male
patient
,
with
a
clinical
history
of
two
prior
episodes
of
renal
colic
with
urinary
stone
excretion
(
reported
as
uric
acid
stones
in
the
first
episode
and
as
calcium
oxalate
stones
in
the
second
)
,
was
admitted
to
the
hospital
with
severe
non-oliguric
renal
failure
(

06
mmol

L
serum
creatinine
)
,
severe
hyponatremia
(
114

)
,
metabolic

(
14

L
HCO
(

(

)
and
uricemia
in
the
normal
range
.

Abnormalities
at
renal
scan
and
persistency
of
severe
renal
failure
required
to
start
haemodialysis
.

Results
of
renal
biopsy
prompted
us
to
undertake
a
biochemical
and
molecular
biological
evaluation
of
the
patient
for
suspected
adenine
phosphoribosyltransferase
(
APRT
)
deficiency
.

RESULTS
:
HPLC
analysis
of
serum
and
urine
,
for
determining
purine
derivative
profile
,
showed
the
pathological
presence
of
adenine
in
both
biological
fluids
(

and
7
.
11
micromol

in
serum
and
urine
,
respectively;
not
detectable
in
both
fluids
in
healthy
controls
)
.

APRT
assay
in
a
sample
of
patient
hemolysate
showed
no
detectable
activity
of
the
enzyme
(

)
.

Molecular
biological
analysis
of
the
amplified
APRT
gene
revealed
that
the
patient
harboured
in
exon
3
a
homozygous
254
bp
deletion-8
bp
insertion
,
previously
described
only
once
in
a
compound
heterozygote
.

Analysis
of
the
patient
family
showed
that
heterozygotes
for
this
APRT
gene
mutation
,
in
spite
of
a
69%
lower
APRT
enzymatic
activity
than
that
of
healthy
subjects
,
had
no
detectable
adenine
concentrations
in
both
serum
and
urine
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
Results
of
the
first
patient
harbouring
the
homozygous
254
bp
deletion-8
bp
insertion
of
the
APRT
gene
strongly
indicated
that
definitive
diagnosis
of
APRT
deficiency
(
often
under
or
misdiagnosed
)
would
require
a
combined
clinical
,
biochemical
and
molecular
biological
evaluation
.
Polyethylenimine
(
PEI
)
is
one
of
the
most
broadly
used
polycations
for
gene
delivery
due
to
its
high
transfection
efficiency
and
commercial
availability
but
materials
are
cytotoxic
and
often
polydisperse
.

The
goal
of
current
work
is
to
develop
an
alternative
family
of
polycations
based
on
controlled
living
radical
polymerization
(
CLRP
)
and
to
optimize
the
polymer
structure
for
efficient
gene
delivery
.

In
this
study
,
well-defined
poly
(
glycidyl
methacrylate
)
(
P
(
GMA
)
)
homopolymers
were
synthesized
using
reversible
addition-fragmentation
chain

(
RAFT
)
polymerization
followed
by
decoration
using
three
different
types
of
oligoamines
,

,
tetraethylenepentamine
(
TEPA
)
,
pentaethylenehexamine
(
PEHA
)
,
and
tris
(
2-aminoethyl
)
amine
(
TREN
)
,
respectively
,
to
generate
various
P
(
GMA-oligoamine
)
homopolycations
.

The
effect
of
P
(
GMA
)
backbone
length
and
structure
of
oligoamine
on
gene
transfer
efficiency
was
then
determined
.

The
optimal
polymer
,
P
(
GMA-TEPA
)
(
50
)
,
provided
comparable
transfection
efficiency
but
lower
cytotoxicity
than
PEI
.

P
(
GMA-TEPA
)
(
50
)
was
then
used
as
the
cationic
block
in
diblock
copolymers
containing
hydrophilic
N-
(
2-hydroxypropyl
)
methacrylamide
(
HPMA
)
and
oligo
(
ethylene
glycol
)
monomethyl
ether
methacrylate
(
OEGMA
)
.

Polyplexes
of
block
copolymers
were
stable
against
aggregation
in
physiological
salt
condition
and
in
Opti-MEM
due
to
the
shielding
effect
of
P
(
HPMA
)
and
P
(
OEGMA
)
.

However
,
the
presence
of
the
HPMA
/
OEGMA
block
significantly
decreased
the
transfection
efficacy
of
P
(
GMA-TEPA
)
(
50
)
homopolycation
.

To
compensate
for
reduced
cell
uptake
caused
by
the
hydrophilic
shell
of
polyplex
,
the
integrin-binding
peptide
,
RGD
,
was
conjugated
to
the
hydrophilic
chain
end
of
P
(
OEGMA
)
(
15
)
-b-P
(
GMA-TEPA
)
(
50
)
copolymer
by
Michael-type
addition
reaction
.

At
low
polymer
to
DNA
ratios
,
the
RGD-functionalized
polymer
showed
increased
gene
delivery
efficiency
to
HeLa
cells
compared
to
analogous
polymers
lacking
RGD

Tocopherols
and
tocotrienols
represent
the
two
subclasses
within
the
vitamin
E
family
of
compounds
.

However
,
tocotrienols
are
significantly
more
potent
than
tocopherols
in
suppressing
epidermal
growth
factor
(
EGF
)
-dependent
normal
mammary
epithelial
cell
growth
.

EGF
is
a
potent
mitogen
for
normal
mammary
epithelial
cells
and
an
initial
event
in
EGF-receptor
mitogenic-signalling
is
protein
kinase
C
(

)
activation
.

Studies
were
conducted
to
determine
if
the
antiproliferative
effects
of
specific
tocopherol
and
tocotrienol
isoforms
are
associated
with
a
reduction
in
EGF-receptor
mitogenic
signalling
and
/
or
PKC
activation
.

Normal
mammary
epithelial
cells
isolated
from
midpregnant
BALB

mice
were
grown
in
primary
culture
,
and
maintained
on
serum-free
media
containing
10
ng

mL
EGF
as
a
mitogen
,
and
treated
with
various
doses
(
0-250
microm
)
of
alpha-
,
gamma-
,
or
delta-tocopherol
or
alpha-
,
gamma-
,
or
delta-tocotrienol
.

Treatment
with
growth
inhibitory
doses
of
delta-tocopherol
(
100
microm
)
,
alpha-tocotrienol
(
50
microm
)
,
or
gamma-
or
delta-tocotrienol
(
10
microm
)
did
not
affect
EGF-receptor
levels
,
EGF-induced
EGF-receptor
tyrosine
kinase
activity
,
or
total
intracellular
levels
of
PKC
(
alpha
)
.

However
,
these
treatments
were
found
to
inhibit
EGF-induced
PKC
(
alpha
)
activation
as
determined
by
its
translocation
from
the
cytosolic
to
membrane
fraction
.

Treatment
with
250
microm
alpha-
or
gamma-tocopherol
had
no
affect
on
EGF-receptor
mitogenic
signalling
or
cell
growth
.

These
findings
demonstrate
that
the
inhibitory
effects
of
specific
tocopherol
and
tocotrienol
isoforms
on
EGF-dependent
normal
mammary
epithelial
cell
mitogenesis
occurs
downstream
from
the
EGF-receptor
and
appears
to
be
mediated
,
at
least
in
part
,
by
a
reduction
in
PKC
(
alpha
)
activation
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
These

of

and
a
better
maintained
hepatocellular

The
improved
hepatocellular
function
may
be
in
part
mediated
by
carbon
monoxide
because
of
up-regulation
of
HO-1
.

Pretreatment
with

β-Galactosidase
(
lacZ
)
has
bifunctional
activity
.

It
hydrolyzes
lactose
to
galactose
and
glucose
and
catalyzes
the
intramolecular
isomerization
of
lactose
to
allolactose
,
the
lac
operon
inducer
.

β-Galactosidase
promotes
the
isomerization
by
means
of
an
acceptor
site
that
binds
glucose
after
its
cleavage
from
lactose
and
thus
delays
its
exit
from
the
site
.

However
,
because
of
its
relatively
low
affinity
for
glucose
,
details
of
this
site
have
remained
elusive
.

We
present
structural
data
mapping
the
glucose
site
based
on
a
substituted
enzyme
(
G794A-β-galactosidase
)
that
traps
allolactose
.

Various
lines
of
evidence
indicate
that
the
glucose
of
the
trapped
allolactose
is
in
the
acceptor
position
.

The
evidence
includes
structures
with
Bis-Tris
(
2
,
2-bis
(
hydroxymethyl
)
-2
,
2'
,
2″-nitrilotriethanol
)
and
l-ribose
in
the
site
and
kinetic
binding
studies
with
substituted
β-galactosidases
.

The
site
is
composed
of
Asn-102
,
His-418
,
Lys-517
,
Ser-796
,
Glu-797
,
and
Trp-999
.

Ser-796
and
Glu-797
are
part
of
a
loop
(
residues
795-803
)
that
closes
over
the
active
site
.

This
loop
appears
essential
for
the
bifunctional
nature
of
the
enzyme
because
it
helps
form
the
glucose
binding
site
.

In
addition
,
because
the
loop
is
mobile
,
glucose
binding
is
transient
,
allowing
the
release
of
some
glucose
.

Bioinformatics
studies
showed
that
the
residues
important
for
interacting
with
glucose
are
only
conserved
in
a
subset
of
related
enzymes
.

Thus
,
intramolecular
isomerization
is
not
a
universal
feature
of
β-galactosidases
.

Genomic
analyses
indicated
that
lac
repressors
were
co-selected
only
within
the
conserved
subset
.

This
shows
that
the
glucose
binding
site
of
β-galactosidase
played
an
important
role
in
lac
operon
evolution
.

Allopurinol
is
an
inhibitor
of
xanthine

(
XOR
)
and
inhibits
the
generation
of
uric
acid
(
UA
)
as
the
final
product

catabolism
,
as
well
as
the
resulting

)
,

Elevation
of
the
serum
UA
(
SUA
)
level
,
referred
to
as
hyperuricemia
(
HU
)
,
eventually
leads
to
gout
and
allopurinol
has
been
used
for
the
treatment
of
HU
and
gout
.

Studies
have
revealed
the
role
of
elevated
SUA
levels
and
the
associated
oxidative
stress
(
OS
)
in
a
broad
spectrum
of
pathological
conditions
and
it
is
anticipated
that
these
findings
would
also
expand
the
use
of
allopurinol
as
a
therapeutic
drug
.

This
article
presents
a
review
of
reports
,
mainly
of
recent
studies
,
on
the
efficacy
of
allopurinol
in
various
diseases
and
explores
novel
potential
uses
of
the
drug
.

Important
novel
and
potential
uses
of
great
interest
include
metabolic
syndrome
(
MetS
)
and
related
disorders
,
chronic
kidney
disease
(
CKD
)
,
nonalcoholic
fatty
liver
disease
(
NAFLD
)
and
nonalcoholic
steatohepatitis
(
NASH
)
.

Ischemia-reperfusion
injury
and
mucositis
,
encountered
as
adverse
effects
of
cancer
treatment
,
have
also
been
under
investigation
as
potential
targets
for
allopurinol
.
Endosulfan
(
ES
)
,
a
persistent
organochlorine
pesticide
,
is
widely
used
despite
its
toxicity
to
non-target
animals
.

Upon
reaching
water
bodies
,
ES
can
cause
negative
effects
on
aquatic
animals
,
including
disruption
of
hormonal
systems
.

However
,
the
action
of
ES
on
fish
reproductive
axis
has
been
hardly
studied
thus
far
.

The
aim
of
the
present
work
was
to
assess
the
endocrine
disruptive
potential
of
endosulfan
on
the
pituitary
gonadotropins
levels
and
on
the
testes
function
due
to
ES
in
the
South
American
freshwater
fish
Cichlasoma
dimerus
,
using
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
approaches
.

In
vitro
experiments
showed
that
ES
inhibited
the
LH-stimulated
steroidogenesis
in
gonads;
no
change
was
observed
in
gonadotropins
release
from
pituitaries
in
culture
.

Laboratory
waterborne
ES
(
0
.
1
,
0
.
3
and
1
μg
/
L
)
exposure
for
two
months
caused
decrease
in
βFSH
pituitary
content
and
γGT
activity
in
the
testes
(
Sertoli
cell
function
marker
)
.

Testicular
histology
revealed
pathologies
such
as
scarce
intermediate
stages
of
spermatogenesis
,
release
of
immature
germ
cells
into
the
lobular
lumen
,
presence
of
foam
cells
and
interstitial
fibrosis
.

As
FSH
and
FSH-mediated
steroidogenesis
regulate
spermatogenesis
and
Sertoli
cell
function
,
the
effect
of
ES
on
FSH
could
be
responsible
for
the
morphological
alterations
observed
in
testes
.

In
vitro
,
ES
disrupted
steroidogenesis
in
gonads
,
therefore
similar
effects
in
vivo
cannot
be
ruled
out
.

Based
on
this
evidence
,
ES
exhibits
an
endocrine
disruptive
action
on
the
reproductive
axis
of
C
.

dimerus
,
causing
disruption
at
the
pituitary
and
/
or
at
the
gonad
level
.

These
effects
could
acquire
ecological
significance
under
prolonged
exposure
to
the
pesticide
in

Pseudohypoaldosteronism
type
1
(
PHA1
)
,
a
rare
disorder
of
infancy
,
presents
with
potential
life-threatening
salt
wasting
and
failure
to
thrive
.

Thus
far
,
PHA1
has
been
attributed
to
mutations
affecting
the
mineralocorticoid
receptor
or
any
of
the
three
subunits
assembling
the
amiloride-sensitive
epithelial
sodium
channel
(
ENaC
)
.

However
,
a
lot
of
patients
with
a
phenotype
resembling
PHA1
,
show
no
defects
in
these
proteins
,
making
it
likely
that
further
genes
are
involved
in
the
aetiology
of
this
disease
.

Recent
studies
have
elucidated
additional
participants
(
alpha-spectrin
and
members
of
the
families
of
transmembrane
serine
proteases
,
ubiquitin-protein
ligases
,
and
serum-
and
glucocorticoid-regulated
kinases
,
respectively
)
regulating
and
/
or
interacting
in
the
complex
pathway
of
sodium
retention
in
the
amiloride-sensitive
distal
nephron
.

This
led
us
to
investigate
whether
PHA1
can
also
be
associated
with
mutations
in
some
of
these
genes
.

Our
data
suggest
that
at
least
the
prostasin
gene
might
be
excluded
as
a
causative
locus
.
Recent
observations
point
to
the
role
played
by
Zn2
+
as
an
inducer
of
neuronal
death
.

Two
Zn2
+
targets
have
been
identified
that
result
in
inhibition
of
mitochondrial
respiration
:
the
bc1
center
and
,
more
recently
,
alpha-ketoglutarate
dehydrogenase
.

Zn2
+
is
also
a
mediator
of
oxidative
stress
,
leading
to
mitochondrial
failure
,
release
of
apoptotic
peptides
,
and
neuronal
death
.

We
now
present
evidence
,
by
means
of
direct
biochemical
assays
,
that
Zn2
+
is
imported
through
the
Ca2
+
uniporter
and
directly
targets
major
enzymes
of
energy
production
(
lipoamide
dehydrogenase
)
and
antioxidant
defense
(
thioredoxin
reductase
and
glutathione
reductase
)
.

We
demonstrate
the
following
.

(
a
)
These
matrix
enzymes
are
rapidly
inhibited
by
application
of
Zn2
+
to
intact
mitochondria
.

(
b
)
Delayed
treatment
with
membrane-impermeable
chelators
has
no
effect
,
indicating
rapid
transport
of
biologically
relevant
quantities
of
Zn2
+
into
the
matrix
.

(
c
)
Membrane-permeable
chelators
stop
but
do
not
reverse
enzyme
inactivation
.

(
d
)
Enzyme
inhibition
is
rapid
and
irreversible
and
precedes
the
major
changes
associated
with
the
mitochondrial
permeability
transition
(
MPT
)
.

(
e
)
The
extent
and
rate
of
enzyme
inactivation
linearly
correlates
with
the
MPT
onset
and
propagation
.

(
f
)
The
Ca2
+
uniporter
blocker
,
Ruthenium
Red
,
protects
enzyme
activities
and
delays
pore
opening
up
to
2
microm
Zn2
+
.

An
additional
,
unidentified
import
route
functions
at
higher
Zn2
+
concentrations
.

(
g
)
No
enzyme
inactivation
is
observed
for
Ca2
+
-induced
MPT
.

These
observations
strongly
suggest
that
,
unlike
Ca2
+
,
exogenous
Zn2
+
interferes
with
mitochondrial
NADH
production
and
directly
alters
redox
protection
in
the
matrix
,
contributing
to
mitochondrial
dysfunction
.

Inactivation
of
these
enzymes
by
Zn2
+
is
irreversible
,
and
thus
only
their
de
novo
synthesis
can
restore
function
,
which
may
underlie
persistent
loss
of
oxidative
carbohydrate
metabolism
following
transient
ischemia
.
Fatty
acid
biosynthesis
is
an
emerging
target
for
the
development
of
novel
antibacterial
chemotherapeutics
.

The
dissociated
bacterial
system
is
substantially
different
from
the
large
,
multifunctional
protein
of
mammals
,
and
many
possibilities
exist
for
type-selective
drugs
.

Several
compounds
,
both
synthetic
and
natural
,
target
bacterial
fatty
acid
synthesis
.

Three
compounds
target
the
FabI
enoyl-ACP
reductase
step;
isoniazid
,
a
clinically
used
antituberculosis
drug
,
triclosan
,
a
widely
used
consumer
antimicrobial
,
and
diazaborines
.

In
addition
,
cerulenin
and
thiolactomycin
,
two
fungal
products
,
inhibit
the
FabH
,
FabB
and
FabF
condensation
enzymes
.

Finally
,
the
synthetic
reaction
intermediates
BP1
and
decynoyl-
N-acetyl
cysteamine
inhibit
the
acetyl-CoA
carboxylase
and
dehydratase
isomerase
steps
,
respectively
.

The
mechanisms
of
action
of
these
compounds
,
as
well
as
the
potential
development
of
new
drugs
targeted
against
this
pathway
,
are
discussed
.
Atherogenesis
in
the
vasculature
is
accelerated
by
changes
in
the
dynamic
equilibrium
between
endogenous
tissue
plasminogen
activator
and
plasminogen
activator
inhibitor-1
(
PAI-1
)
.

Increased
expression
of
PAI-1
,
decreased
expression
of
tissue
plasminogen
activator
,
or
both
can
lead
to
decreased
fibrinolytic
activity
and
predispose
to
thrombosis
.

Increased
concentrations
of
insulin
(
and
proinsulin
)
in
the
plasma
increase
plasma
PAI-1
,
although
the
mechanisms
of
this
effect
are
not
known
.

In
addition
,
it
has
been
observed
that
basal
fibrinolytic
activity
is
decreased
in
patients
with
type
2
diabetes;
this
may
accelerate
atherosclerosis
by
exposing
vascular
luminal
wall
surfaces
to
persistent
and
recurrent
thrombi
.

Abnormalities
in
the
vessel
wall
appear
to
contribute
to
the
increased
risk
.

There
is
also
evidence
that
PAI-1
content
is
increased
in
atherosclerotic
lesions
of
patients
with
type
2
diabetes
,
suggesting
that
interventions
to
reduce
insulin
resistance
and
improve
glycemic
control
may
improve
the
fibrinolytic
response
.

Clinical
studies
in
patients
with
polycystic
ovary
syndrome
(
characterized
by
insulin
resistance
,
hyperinsulinemia
,
ovarian
androgen
overproduction
,
and
impaired
fibrinolytic
capacity
)
demonstrated
that
treatment
with
troglitazone
,
an
insulin-sensitizing
agent
,
can
markedly
reduce
blood
levels
of
PAI-1
.

There
is
also
clinical
evidence
that
these
agents
may
contribute
to
regression
of
intimal
medial
thickness
in
patients
with
type
2
diabetes
,
providing
further
indication
that
antidiabetic
interventions
may
help
inhibit
the
progression
of
early
atherosclerotic
lesions
.
Triethylenetetramine
(
TETA;
Syprine;
Merck
Rahway
,
NJ
)
,
a
drug
for
Wilson's
disease
,
is
a
copper
chelator
and
a
charge-deficient
analog
of
polyamine
spermidine
.

We
recently
showed
that
TETA
is
metabolized
in
vitro
by
polyamine
catabolic
enzyme
spermidine
/
spermine-N
(
1
)
-acetyltransferase
(
SSAT1
)
and
by
thialysine
acetyltransferase
(
SSAT2
)
to
its
monoacetylated
derivative
(
MAT
)
.

The
acetylation
of
TETA
is
increased
in
SSAT1-overexpressing
mice
compared
with
wild-type
mice
.

However
,
SSAT1-deficient
mice
metabolize
TETA
at
the
same
rate
as
the
wild-type
mice
,
indicating
the
existence
of
another
N-acetylase
respons
2ible
for
its
metabolism
in
mice
.

Here
,
we
show
that
siRNA-mediated
knockdown
of
SSAT2
in
HEPG2
cells
and
in
primary
hepatocytes
from
the
SSAT1-deficient
or
wild-type
mice
reduced
the
metabolism
of
TETA
to
MAT
.

By
contrast
,
1
,
12-diamino-3
,
6
,
9-triazadodecane
(
SpmTrien
)
,
a
charge-deficient
spermine
analog
,
was
an
extremely
poor
substrate
of
human
recombinant
SSAT2
and
was
metabolized
by
SSAT1
in
HEPG2
cells
and
in
wild-type
primary
hepatocytes
.

Thus
,
despite
the
similar
structures
of
TETA
and
SpmTrien
,
SSAT2
is
the
main
acetylator
of
TETA
,
whereas
SpmTrien
is
primarily
acetylated
by
SSAT1
.
A
substantial
proportion
of
women
with
the
polycystic
ovary
syndrome
(
PCOS
)
are
obese
and
obesity
is
considered
as
a
prothrombotic
state
.

Platelet-derived
microparticles
(
PMPs
)
might
be
implicated
in
the
activation
of
the
coagulation
cascade
.

We
aimed
to
assess
plasma
PMPs
in
overweight
/
obese
women
with
PCOS
.

We
measured
plasma
PMPs
and
determined
anthropometric
,
metabolic
,
hormonal
and
ultrasonographic
features
of
PCOS
in
67
overweight
/
obese
women
with
PCOS
(
with
body
mass

[
BMI
]
>25
.
0
kg
/
m
(

)
and
in
21
BMI-matched
healthy
women
.

Circulating
androgens
and
markers
of
insulin
resistance
(
IR
)
were
higher
in
women
with
PCOS
than
in
controls
.

Plasma
PMPs
were
also
higher
in
women
with
PCOS
than
in
controls
(
p
=
0
.
046
)
.

In
women
with
PCOS
,
plasma
PMPs
correlated
with
the
mean
number
of
follicles
in
the
ovaries
(
r
=
0
.
343;
p
=
0
.
006
)
.

In
controls
,
plasma
PMPs
did
not
correlate
with
any
of
the
studied
parameters
.

In
conclusion
,
plasma
PMPs
are
elevated
in
overweight
/
obese
women
with
PCOS
compared
with
BMI-matched
controls
.

The
cause
of
this
increase
is
unclear
but
both
IR
and
hyperandrogenemia
might
be
implicated
.

More
studies
are
required
to
elucidate
the
pathogenesis
of
the
elevation
of
PMPs
in
PCOS
and
to
assess
its
implications
on
the
cardiovascular
risk
of
these
patients

The
impact
of
the
synthetic
glucocorticoid
prednisone
on
adrenal
steroid
hormone
production
was
examined
using
24-hour
urinary
steroid
hormone
profiling
.

Five
women
,
who
were
chronically
taking
low-dose
prednisone
,
were
tested
,
and
the
relevant
literature
was
reviewed
.

As
expected
,
adrenal
glucocorticoid
production
,
measured
by
urinary
terminal
cortisol
and
cortisone
metabolites
,
was
markedly
suppressed
compared
to
reference
range
values
(
p
=
0
.
03
)
.

Urinary
cortisol
and
cortisone
,
reflecting
circulating
glucocorticoids
,
were
decreased
to
a
lesser
extent
than
their
terminal
metabolites
.

Urinary
dehydroepiandrosterone
(
DHEA
)
excretion
was
dramatically
suppressed
(
p
=
0
.
03
)
,
while
the
downstream
androgen
metabolites
androsterone
and
etiocholanolone
were
suppressed
to
a
lesser
extent
.

Aldosterone
and
tetrahydrocorticosterone
production
demonstrated
modest
suppression
after
prednisone
administration
,
but
allo-tetrahydrocorticosterone
,
which
is
highly
sensitive
to
adrenocorticotropic
hormone
(
ACTH
)
secretion
,
was
suppressed
to
a
greater
extent
.

Prednisone
administration
results
in
a
decrease
in
ACTH
secretion
by
the
anterior
pituitary
,
suppressing
synthesis
of
glucocorticoids
,
DHEA
,
and
DHEA
metabolites
.

Decreased
glucocorticoid
synthesis
is
adaptive
,
because
prednisone
is
active
at
the
glucocorticoid
receptor
,
but
suppression
of
DHEA
synthesis
is
not
mitigated
by
prednisone
.

DHEA
is
an
important
sex
hormone
precursor
,
neurosteroid
,
and
endocrine
and
immune
modulator;
therefore
,
DHEA
depletion
may
have
significant
adverse
consequences
in
terms
of
sex
hormone
production
,
bone
health
,
endocrine
and
immune
system
function
,
and
neuropsychiatric
status
.

Studies
of
DHEA
replacement

taking
prednisone
for
lupus
demonstrate
amelioration
of
some
of
these
adverse
effects

graphene
nanoribbons
(
crGNRs
)
were
dispersed
at
high
concentrations
in
chlorosulfonic
acid
to
form
anisotropic
liquid
crystal
phases
.

The
liquid
crystal
solutions
were
spun
directly
into
hundreds
of
meters
of
continuous
macroscopic
fibers
.

The
relationship
of
fiber
morphology
to
coagulation
bath
conditions
was
studied
.

The
effects
of
colloid
concentration
,
annealing
temperature
,
spinning
air
gap
,
and
pretension
during
annealing
on
the
fibers'
performance
were
also
investigated
.

Heat
treatment
of
the
as-spun
GONR
fibers
at
1500
°C
produced
thermally
reduced
graphene
nanoribbon
(
trGNR
)
fibers
with
a
tensile
strength
of
378
MPa
,
Young's
modulus
of
36
.
2
GPa
,
and
electrical
conductivity
of
285
S
/
cm
,
which
is
considerably
higher
than
that
in
other
reported
graphene-derived
fibers
.

This
better
trGNR
fiber
performance
was
due
to
the
air
gap
spinning
and
annealing
with
pretension
that
produced
higher
molecular
alignment
within
the
fibers
,
as
determined
by
X-ray
diffraction
and
scanning
electron
microscopy
.

The
specific
modulus
of
trGNR
fibers
is
higher
than
that
of
the
commercial
general
purpose
carbon
fibers
and
commonly
used
metals
such
as
Al
,
Cu
,
and
steel
.

The
properties
of
trGNR
fibers
can
be
further
improved
by
optimizing
the
spinning
conditions
with
higher
draw
ratio
,
annealing
conditions
with
higher
pretensions
,
and
using
longer
flake
GONRs
.

This
technique
is
a
new
high-carbon-yield
approach
to
make
the
next
generation
carbon
fibers
based
on

Active
Hexose
Correlated
Compound
(
AHCC
)
is
an
immunostimulatory
nutritional
supplement
.

AHCC
effects
and
mechanism
of
action
on
intestinal
epithelial
cells
or
monocytes
are
poorly
described
.

AHCC
was
added
to
the
culture
medium
of
intestinal
epithelial
cells
(
IEC18
and
HT29
cells
)
and
monocytes
(
THP-1
cells
)
and
assessed
the
secretion
of
proinflammatory
cytokines
by
ELISA
.

Inhibitors
of
NFκB
and
MAPKs
were
used
to
study
signal
transduction
pathways
while
TLR4
and
MyD88
were
silenced
in
IEC18
cells
using
shRNA
.

It
was
found
that
AHCC
induced
GROα
and
MCP1
secretion
in
IEC18
and
IL-8
in
HT29
cells
.

These
effects
depended
on
NFκB
activation
,
and
partly
on
MAPKs
activation
and
on
the
presence
of
MyD88
and
TLR4
.

In
THP-1
cells
AHCC
evoked
IL-8
,
IL-1β
and
TNF-α
secretion
.

The
induction
of
IL-8
depended
on
JNK
and
NFκB
activation
.

Therefore
,
AHCC
exerts
immunostimulatory
effects
on
intestinal
epithelial
cells
and
monocytes
involving
TLR4
/
MyD88
and
NFκB
/
MAPK
signal
transduction
pathways
.
The
cellular
action
of
steroid
hormones
is
mediated
by
specific
receptors
.

Recently
,
two
different
estrogen
receptors
(
ER
)
,
alpha
and
beta
,
have
been
cloned
with
a
specific
tissue
distribution
.

Active
estrogen
as
well
as
active
progestin
are
compounds
of
oral
hormonal
contraceptives
and
hormone
replacement
therapy
.

To
examine
the
regulation
of
ER-alpha
and
-beta
activities
after
treatment
with
synthetic
progestins
and
synthetic
and
natural
estrogens
,
COS
7
cells
were
transfected
with
the
vector
expressing
ER-alpha
and
-beta
in
combination
with
a
luciferase
reporter
vector
.

ER-alpha
activity
was
upregulated
in
the
presence
of
synthetic
progestins
in
a
dose-dependent
manner
.

Norethisterone
,
norethynodrel
and
desogestrel
proved
to
be
the
most
potent
stimulatory
agents
of
ER-alpha
expression
.

On
the
other
hand
,
not
all
progestins
exhibited
a
stimulatory
action
on
ER-beta
activity
.

Only
norgestrel
,
levonorgestrel
,
norethynodrel
and
norethisterone
induced
ER-beta-activating
functions
in
a
dose-dependent
manner
.

Luciferase
activity
due
to
estrogen
stimulation
served
as
a
positive
control
.

Our
results
indicate
that
progestins
have
different
effects
on
the
activities
of
ER-alpha
and
-beta
.

beta-Adrenoceptor

using

a

The
beta-adrenoceptor

The

manner
with

nM

This
is
in
contrast
to
the
results
of
binding
data
from
heart

,
where
these
beta
1-antagonists
bind
in
a
biphasic
manner
with
about
30%
of
an
additional
low
affinity
site
,
presumably
corresponding
to
the
beta
2-adrenoceptor
.

The
beta

bisoprolol
revealed
two
binding
sites
at
the
heart

at

well

Our
results
suggest
that
viable
adult

may
contain
two
beta

exhibiting
different
affinities
for

BACKGROUND
:
Sunitinib
malate
(
SUTENT
)
is
an
oral
,
multitargeted
tyrosine
kinase
inhibitor
,
approved
multinationally
for
the
treatment
of
advanced
RCC
and
of
imatinib-resistant
or
-
intolerant
GIST
.

The
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
explore
potential
biomarkers
of
sunitinib
pharmacological
activity
via
serial
assessment
of
plasma
levels
of
four
soluble
proteins
from
patients
in
a
phase
II
study
of
advanced
RCC
:
VEGF
,
soluble
VEGFR-2
(
sVEGFR-2
)
,
placenta
growth
factor
(
PlGF
)
,
and
a
novel
soluble
variant
of
VEGFR-3
(
sVEGFR-3
)
.

METHODS
:
Sunitinib
was
administered
at
50
mg
/
day
on
a
4
/
2
schedule
(
4
weeks
on
treatment
,
2
weeks
off
treatment
)
to
63
patients
with
metastatic
RCC
after
failure
of
first-line
cytokine
therapy
.

Predose
plasma
samples
were
collected
on
days
1
and
28
of
each
cycle
and
analyzed
via
ELISA
.

RESULTS
:
At
the
end
of
cycle
1
,
VEGF
and
PlGF
levels
increased
>3-fold
(
relative
to
baseline
)
in
24

and

sVEGFR-2
levels
decreased

during

,
while
sVEGFR-3

of
55
cases
(

)
,
and

in
all
but
2
cases
.

These
levels
tended
to
return
to
near-baseline
after
2
weeks
off
treatment
,
indicating
that
these
effects
were
dependent
on
drug
exposure
.

Overall
,
significantly
larger
changes
in
VEGF
,
sVEGFR-2
,
and
sVEGFR-3
levels
were
observed
in
patients
exhibiting

those
exhibiting

.

CONCLUSION
:
Sunitinib
treatment
in
advanced
RCC
patients
leads
to
modulation
of
plasma
levels
of
circulating
proteins
involved
in
VEGF
signaling
,
including
soluble
forms
of
two
VEGF
receptors
.

This
panel
of
proteins
may
be
of

as
biomarkers
of
the
pharmacological
and

and
of
angiogenic
processes
in

We
previously
characterized
1-ethyl-2-benzimidazolinone
(

)
,
as
well
as
the
clinically
useful
benzoxazoles
,
chlorzoxazone
(

,
and

,
as
pharmacological
activators

The
mechanism
of
activation
of
hIK1

as
the
highly
homologous
small-conductance
,
Ca
(

K
(

channel
,
rSK2
,
was
determined
following
heterologous

in
Xenopus
oocytes
using
two-electrode
voltage

(
TEVC
)
and
excised
,
inside-out

techniques
.

1-EBIO
,
CZ
,
and
ZOX
activated
both
hIK1
and
rSK2
in
TEVC
and
excised
inside-out
patch-clamp
experiments
.

In
excised
,
inside-out
patches
,
1-EBIO
and
CZ
induced
a
concentration-dependent
activation
of
hIK1
,
with
half-maximal

)
values
of
84

respectively
.

Similarly
,
CZ
activated
rSK2
with
a
K
(
1

)
of
87
microM
.

In
the
absence
of
CZ
,
the
Ca
(
2

)
-dependent
activation
of
hIK1
was
best
fit
with
a
K
(
1

)
of
700
nM
and
a
Hill

(
n

of

rSK2
was
activated
by
Ca
(

with
a
K
(

of
700
nM
and
an
n

Addition
of
CZ
had
no
effect
on
either
the
K
(

or
n
for
Ca
(
2

-dependent
activation
of
either
hIK1

Rather
,
CZ
increased
channel
activity
at
all
Ca
(

concentrations
(

)
.

Event-duration
analysis
revealed
hIK1
was
minimally
described
by
two
open

.

Activation
by
1-EBIO
had
no
effect
on
tau
(

,
tau

,
or

In
conclusion
,
we
define
1-EBIO

as
the
first
known
activators
of
hIK1

Abstract
We
performed
this
study
to
investigate
the
effect
of
ketorolac
(
a
non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory
drug
)
administration
around
ovarian
stimulation
on
in
vivo
and
in
vitro
fertilization
process
.

Sixty-four
female
mice
(
ICR
)
were
injected
with
ketorolac
(
0
,
7
.
5
,
15
and
30
µg
/
d
)
for
3
d
starting
from
the
day
of
eCG
treatment
.

In
experiment
1
,
41
mice
were
triggered
by
hCG
and
then
mated;
two-cell
embryos
were
obtained
and
in
vitro
development
up
to
blastocyst
was
observed
.

In
experiment
2
,
23
mice
were
triggered
by
hCG
and
mature
oocytes
were
collected;
in
vitro
fertilization
rate
and
subsequent
embryo
development
up
to
blastocyst
was
recorded
.

In
experiment
1
,
the
blastocyst-forming
rates
per
in
vivo
fertilized
two-cell
embryo
showed
an
inverse
relationship
with
a
dosage
of
ketorolac
(
97
.
6%
,
64
.
2%
,
35
.
4%
and
25
.
9%
)
.

In
experiment
2
,
degenerated
oocytes
were
frequently
observed
in
a
dose-dependent
manner
(
4
.
3%
,
22
.
9%
,
22
.
4%
and
75
.
0%
)
.

Lower
fertilization
rates
were
noted
in
all
the
three
ketorolac-treating
groups;
blastocyst-forming
rate
was
significantly
lower
in
30-µg-treating
group
when
compared
with
the
control
group
.

Administration
of
ketorolac
around
ovarian
stimulation
significantly
affects
the
development
of
in
vivo
fertilized
embryo
in
a
dose-dependent
manner
.

High-dose
ketorolac
could
result
in
a
poor
oocyte
quality
and
decreased
embryo
developmental
competence

Import
of
acylcarnitine
into
mitochondrial
matrix
through
carnitine
/
acylcarnitine-translocase
(
CACT
)
is
fundamental
for
lipid
catabolism
.

To
probe
the
effect
of
CACT
down-expression
on
lipid
metabolism
in
muscle
,
human
myocytes
were
stably
transfected
with
CACT-antisense
construct
.

In
presence
of
low
concentration
of
palmitate
,
transfected
cells
showed
decreased
palmitate
oxidation
and
acetyl-carnitine
content
,
increased
palmitoyl-carnitine
level
,
and
reduced
insulin-dependent
decrease
of
fatty
acylcarnitine-to-fatty
acyl-CoA
ratio
.

The
augmented
palmitoyl-carnitine
synthesis
,
also
in
the
presence
of
insulin
,
could
be
related
to
an
altered
regulation
of
carnitine-palmitoyl-transferase
1
(
CPT
1
)
by
malonyl-CoA
,
whose
synthesis
is
dependent
by
the
availability
of
cytosolic
acetyl-groups
.

Indeed
,
all
the
described
effects
were
completely
overcome
by
CACT
neo-expression
by
recombinant
adenovirus
vector
or
by
addition
of
acetyl-carnitine
to
cultures
.

Acetyl-carnitine
effect
was
related
to
an
increase
of
malonyl-CoA
and
was
abolished
by
down-expression
,
via
antisense
RNA
strategy
,
of
acetyl-CoA
carboxylase-beta
,
the
mitochondrial
membrane
enzyme
involved
in
the
direct
CPT
1
inhibition
via
malonyl-CoA
synthesis
.

Thus
,
in
our
experimental
model
the
modulation
of
CACT
expression
has
consequences
for
CPT
1
activity
,
while
the
biologic
effects
of
acetyl-carnitine
are
not
associated
with
a
generic
supply
of
energy
compounds

the

Inhibition

is
a
promising
therapeutic
approach
that
aims
to
stabilize
the
progression

This
may
be
accomplished
by
inhibiting

)
,
which
has
a

Murine

found
to
be
differentially
sensitive
to

(
NSAIDs

.

Aspirin
completely
inhibited
bis-oxygenation

in

,
aspirin-treated

metabolized

primarily
to

were
determined
for

by
measuring

Among

NSAIDs
tested
,
indomethacin

piroxicam
preferentially
inhibited
PGH

inhibited
both
enzymes
with
comparable
potencies;
and
6-methoxy-2-naphthylacetic
acid
preferentially
inhibited

.

These
results
demonstrate
that
the
two
PGH
synthases
are
pharmacologically
distinct
and
indicate
that
it
may
be
possible
to
develop
isozyme-specific

The

suggested
for
the

to
overcome
the

to
the

The

formed

.

The

effectively
silenced
SHP-1
gene
expression
in
cardiomyocytes
,
leading
to
a
significant

under

.

In
comparison
to

,
relatively
large
amounts
of

molecules
remained
after
treatment
with
the

Cardiac

of
the

resulted
in
substantial
improvement
in

,
which
can
be
explained
by
the
enhancement
of
cardiac

.

In
addition

induced
a

is
a
useful
system
for

A
positive
association
between
air
pollution
exposure
and
increased
human
risk
of
chronic
heart
disease
progression
is
well
established
.

In
the
current
study
,
we
test
two
hypotheses
:
(
1
)
the
cardiac
compensatory
changes
in
response
to
air
pollution
are
dependent
on
its
composition
and
(
2
)
specific
cardiac
adaptations
are
regulated
by
atrial
natriuretic
peptide
(
ANP
)
.

We
address
these
hypotheses
by
initially
examining
the
exposure
effects
of
ozone
(
O
(
3
)
)
and
/
or
particulate
matter
(
PM
)
on
cardiac
function
in
C57Bl
/
6J
(
B6
)
mice
.

Subsequently
,
the
results
are
compared
with
cardiac
functional
changes
to
the
same
exposures
in
Nppa
(
the
precursor
gene
for
ANP
)
knockout
(
KO
)
mice
.

Separate
groups
of
mice
underwent
3
consecutive
days
of
the
same
exposure
sequence
for
3h
each
consisting
of
the
following
:
(
1
)
6h
of
filtered
air
(
FAFA
)
,
(
2
)
O
(
3
)
then
FA
(
O
(
3
)
FA
)
,
(
3
)
FA
then
carbon
black
(
FACB
)
,
or
(
4
)
O
(
3
)
then
CB
.

Cardiac
function
was
assessed
using
a
conductance
catheter
to
generate
cardiac
pressure-volume
loops
8-10h
following
each
exposure
sequence
.

As
compared
with
FAFA
,
each
sequence
led
to
a
substantial
drop
(
as
much
as
33%
)
in
stroke
volume
and
cardiac
output
.

However
,
these
losses
of
cardiac
function
occurred
by
different
compensatory
mechanisms
dependent
on
the
pollutant
composition
.

For
example
,
O
(
3
)
FA
exposure
led
to
reductions
in
both
end-systolic
and
end-diastolic
left
ventricular
(
LV
)
volumes
,
whereas
FACB
exposure
led
an
increase
in
end-diastolic
LV
volume
.

These
same
cardiac
compensatory
changes
were
largely
abolished
in
Nppa
KO
mice
following
O
(
3
)
FA
or
FACB
exposure
.

These
results
suggest
that
cardiac
functional
changes
in
response
to
air
pollution
exposure
are
strongly
dependent
on
the
pollutant
constituents
,
especially
related
to
O
(
3
)
and
/
or
PM
.

Furthermore
,
ANP
regulation
appears
to
be
crucial
to
these
cardiac
compensatory
mechanisms
induced
by
air
pollution
.
Understanding
the
molecular
evolution
of
genes
that
underlie
intraspecific
polymorphisms
can
provide
insights
into
the
process
of
adaptive
evolution
.

For
adaptive
polymorphisms
characterized
by
gene
presence
/
absence
(
P
/
A
)
variation
,
underlying
loci
commonly
show
signatures
of
long-term
balancing
selection
,
with
gene-presence
and
gene-absence
alleles
maintained
as
two
divergent
lineages
.

We
examined
the
molecular
evolution
of
two
unlinked
P
/
A
polymorphisms
that
underlie
a
well-documented
adaptive
polymorphism
for
cyanogenesis
(
hydrogen
cyanide
release
with
tissue
damage
)
in
white
clover
.

Both
cyanogenic
and
acyanogenic
plants
occur
in
this
species
,
and
the
ecological
forces
that
maintain
this
chemical
defence
polymorphism
have
been
studied
for
several
decades
.

Using
a
sample
of
65
plants
,
we
investigated
the
molecular
evolution
of
sequences
flanking
the
two
underlying
cyanogenesis
genes
:
Ac
/
ac
(
controlling
the
presence
/
absence
of
cyanogenic
glucosides
)
and
Li
/
li
(
controlling
the
presence
/
absence
of
their
hydrolysing
enzyme
,
linamarase
)
.

A
combination
of
genome
walking
,
PCR
assays
,
DNA
sequence
analysis
and
Southern
blotting
was
used
to
test
whether
these
adaptive
P
/
A
polymorphisms
show
evidence
of
long-term
balancing
selection
,
or
whether
gene-absence
alleles
have
evolved
repeatedly
through
independent
deletion
events
.

For
both
loci
,
we
detect
no
signatures
of
balancing
selection
in
the
closest
flanking
genomic
sequences
.

Instead
,
we
find
evidence
for
variation
in
the
size
of
the
deletions
characterizing
gene-absence
alleles
.

These
observations
strongly
suggest
that
both
of
these
polymorphisms
have
been
evolving
through
recurrent
gene
deletions
over
time
.

We
discuss
the
genetic
mechanisms
that
could
account
for
this
surprising
pattern
and
the
implications
of
these
findings
for
mechanisms
of
rapid
adaptive
evolution

Furthermore
,
vasoconstriction

was
not
affected
by
chronic

treatment
,
while
it
was
slightly
reduced
in
coronary

.

We
conclude
that
,
although
our
treatment
protocol
altered
mRNA
receptor
expression
in
several
tissues
relevant
to
migraine
pathophysiology
,
it
did
not
attenuate

Although
osteoclasts
incorporate
bisphosphonates
during
bone
resorption
,
the
mechanism
of
this
incorporation
by
osteoclasts
is
not
known
.

We
previously
reported
that
bisphosphonates
disrupt
the
actin
rings
(
clear
zones
)
formed
in
normal
osteoclasts
,
but
did
not
disrupt
actin
rings
in
osteoclasts
derived
from
osteosclerotic
oc
/
oc
mice
,
which
have
a
defect
in
the
gene
encoding
vacuolar
H
(
+
)
-ATPase
(
V-ATPase
)
.

The
present
study
showed
that
V-ATPase
is
directly
involved
in
the
incorporation
of
risedronate
,
a
nitrogen
containing
bisphosphonate
,
into
osteoclasts
.

Treatment
of
osteoclasts
with
risedronate
disrupted
actin
rings
and
inhibited
pit
formation
by
osteoclasts
on
dentine
slices
.

Bafilomycin
A
(
1
)
,
a
V-ATPase
inhibitor
,
inhibited
the
pit-forming
activity
of
osteoclasts
but
did
not
disrupt
actin
rings
.

Risedronate
failed
to
disrupt
actin
rings
in
the
presence
of
bafilomycin
A
(
1
)
.

E-64
,
a
lysosomal
cysteine
proteinase
inhibitor
,
showed
no
inhibitory
effect
on
the
demineralization
of
dentine
by
osteoclasts
but
inhibited
the
digestion
of
dentine
matrix
proteins
without
disrupting
actin
rings
.

Risedronate
disrupted
actin
rings
even
in
the
presence
of
E-64
.

Treatment
of
osteoclasts
placed
on
plastic
plates
with
risedronate
also
disrupted
actin
rings
.

Bafilomycin
A
(
1
)
but
not
E64
prevented
the
disruption
of
actin
rings
in
osteoclasts
treated
with
risedronate
on
plastic
plates
.

Inhibition
of
V-ATPase
with
bafilomycin
A
(
1
)
also
prevented
disruption
of
actin
rings
by
etidronate
,
a
non-nitrogen-containing
bisphosphonate
.

These
results
suggest
that
V-ATPase
induced
acidification
beneath
the
ruffled
borders
of
osteoclasts
and
subsequent
bone
demineralization
triggers
the
incorporation
of
both
nitrogen-containing
and
non-nitrogen-containing
bisphosphonates
into
osteoclasts
.
The
expression
and
activity
of
Fatty
Acid
Synthase
(
FASN;
the
sole
enzyme
capable
of
the
reductive
de
novo
synthesis
of
long-chain
fatty
acids
from
acetyl-CoA
,
malonyl-CoA
,
and
nicotinamide
adenine
dinucleotide
phosphate
-NADPH-
)
is
extremely
low
in
nearly
all
nonmalignant
adult
tissues
,
whereas
it
is
significantly
up-regulated
or
activated
in
many
cancer
types
,
thus
creating
the
potential
for
a
large
therapeutic
index
.

Since
the
pioneering
observation
that
inhibition
of
FASN
activity
by
the
mycotoxin
cerulenin
preferentially
kills
cancer
cells
and
retards
the
growth
of
tumors
in
xenografts
models
,
numerous
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
studies
have
confirmed
the
potential
of
FASN
as
a
target
for
antineoplastic
intervention
.

Other
FASN
inhibitors
such
as
the
cerulenin
derivative
C75
,
the
beta-lactone
orlistat
,
the
green
tea
polyphenol
epigallocatechin-3-gallate
(
EGCG
)
and
other
naturally
occurring
flavonoids
(
i
.

e
.

,
luteolin
,
quercetin
,
and
kaempferol
)
,
as
well
as
the
antibiotic
triclosan
,
have
been
identified
and
have
been
shown
to
limit
cancer
cell
growth
by
inducing
apoptotic
cell
death
.

Though
the
exact
mode
of
action
of
these
FASN
inhibitors
is
under
discussion
,
it
has
been
revealed
that
depletion
of
end-product
fatty
acids
,
toxic
intracellular
accumulation
of
supra-physiological
concentrations
of
the
FASN
substrate
malonyl-CoA
and
/
or
limited
membrane
synthesis
and
/
or
functioning
by
altered
production
of
phospholipids
partitioning
into
detergent-resistant
membrane
microdomains
(
lipid
raft-aggregates
)
,
can
explain
,
at
least
in
part
,
the
cytostatic
,
cytotoxic
as
well
as
the
apoptotic
effects
occurring
upon
pharmacological
inhibition
of
FASN
activity
in
cancer
cells
.

Moreover
,
several
cancer-associated
molecular
features
including
nonfunctioning
p53
,
overexpression
of
the
Her-2
/
neu
(
erbB-2
)
oncogene
,
and
hyperactivation
of
the
PI-3'K
down-stream
effector
protein
kinase
B
(
AKT
)
,
appear
to
determine
an
exacerbated
sensitivity
to
FASN
inhibition-induced
cancer
cell
death
.

Although
few
of
these
inhibitors
are
expected
to
be
"exclusively"
selective
for
FASN
,
the
potential
of
FASN
as
a
target
for
antineoplastic
intervention
has
eventually
been
confirmed
by
RNA
interference
(
RNAi
)
-knockdown
of
FASN
.

Certainly
,
future
studies
should
definitely
elucidate
the
ultimate
biochemical
link
between
FASN
inhibition
and
cancer
cell
death
.

Although
the
combination
of
FASN
structural
complexity
and
until
recently
the
lack
of
X-ray
crystallography
data
of
mammalian
FASN
created
a
significant
challenge
in
the
exploitation
of
FASN
as
a
valuable
target
for
drug
development
,
it
is
hoped
that
the
improvement
in
the
selectivity
and
potency
of
forthcoming
novel
FASN-targeted
small

inhibitors
by
taking
advantage
,
for

of

,
such

with
a
series
of
undesired
side

,
such
as
weight

,
fluid

,
cardiac

,
and

.

Nevertheless
,
PPARγ
is
involved
in
the

of
genes
that
control
glucose

and
is
an
important
target
for
drugs
against

,
and

.

In

with
an
improved
pharmacological
profile
,
emphasis
has
shifted
to
selective
ligands
with

Toward
this
end
we
applied
an

,
based
on
pharmacophore-

structure-based

of
the

coupled
with

was
identified
as

potent
ligand
(

)
and
a
relatively
poor
inducer
of
adipocyte
differentiation
.

The
binding
mode
of

was
confirmed
by

,
was
identified
to
be
a

in
the

interactions
.

Further
studies
on
the

of

revealed
a

that
was
to

of

be
a

for

To
explore
the
biochemical

,
a

,

,
and
kinetic

was
conducted
with

These
results
demonstrate
that

BACKGROUND
:
Voltage-gated

CONCLUSIONS
:
At

amitriptyline
showed
alteration
of
behavioral

possibly
related
to
either
alteration

both

Side-effects

Rufinamide
seems

alternative
to

for

whereas

lower

when

The

ratio
in

was
significantly

The
prostaglandin
F
(
2alpha
)
receptor
(
PTGFR
)
is
believed
to
play
a
role
in
the
process
of
parturition
.

The
main
support
for
this
comes
from
animal
studies;
however
,
in
humans
,
the
evidence
is
less
clear
.

The
gene
coding
for
PTGFR
may
be
subject
to
alternative
splicing
to
generate
alternate
variants
with
different
signalling
pathways
.

We
have
determined
regional
(
upper
versus
lower
segment
)
and
labour-associated
expression
of
PTGFR
mRNA
and
a
recently
identified
splice
variant
of
PTGFR
in
human
myometrium
and
decidua
.

We
also
examined
the
effect
of
the
inflammatory
cytokine
interleukin-1beta
(
IL-1beta
)
on
PTGFR
mRNA
expression
in
a
model
of
cultured
human
myometrial
smooth
muscle
cells
.

We
identified
a
PTGFR
transcript
variant
2
(
PTGFR-v2
)
generated
by
alternate
splicing
in
human
myometrium
and
decidua
.

The
PTGFR-v2
contains
an
additional
71
base
pair
exon
,
which
results
in
a
truncated
protein
at
297
amino
acids
compared
with
the
PTGFR
transcript
variant
1
(
PTGFR-v1
)
at
359
amino
acids
.

In
contrast
to
our
hypothesis
,
we
demonstrate
that
PTGFR-v1
and
PTGFR-v2
mRNA
expression
is
not
significantly
higher
in
upper
segment
compared
with
lower
segment
paired
samples
.

We
also
show
a
labour-associated
decrease
in
PTGFR-v1
and
PTGFR-v2
mRNA
expression
in
lower
segment
myometrial
samples
.

IL-1beta-stimulated
mRNA

both

We
suggest
that
the
role
of
the
PTGFR
in
the
human
uterus
requires
further
validation
prior
to
pursuing
it
as
a
target
for
the
treatment
of
preterm

.

In

,
the

of
distinct
variants
suggests
further

OBJECTIVE
:
The
activity
of
the
antitumoral
agent
bexarotene
(
Targretin
,
Bexarotene
)
depends
on
its
binding
to
the
nuclear
retinoid-X
receptor
(
RXR
)
and
subsequent
transcriptional
regulation
of
target
genes
.

Through
RXR
activation
,
bexarotene
may
modulate
numerous
metabolic
pathways
involved
in
atherosclerosis
.

Here
,
we
investigated
the
effect
of
bexarotene
on
atherosclerosis
progression
in
a
dyslipidemic
murine
model
,
the
human
apolipoprotein
E2
knockin
mouse
,
that
develops
essentially
macrophage-laden
lesions
.

METHODS
AND
RESULTS
:
Atherosclerotic
lesions
together
with
different
metabolic
pathways
involved
in
atherosclerosis
were
investigated
in
mice
treated
or
not
with
bexarotene
.

Bexarotene
protects
from
atherosclerosis
development
in
mice
,
at
least
in
part
by
improving
the
circulating
cholesterol
distribution
profile
likely
via
a
marked
decrease
of
dietary
cholesterol
absorption
caused
by
modulation
of
intestinal
expression
of
genes
recently
identified
as
major
players
in
this
process
,
Niemann-Pick-C1-Like1
(
NPC1L1
)
and
CD13
.

This
atheroprotection
appears
despite
a
strong
hypertriglyceridemia
.

Moreover
,
bexarotene
treatment
only
modestly
modulates
inflammatory
gene
expression
in
the
vascular
wall
,
but
markedly
enhanced
the
capacity
of
macrophages
to
efflux
cellular
lipids
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
These
data
provide
evidence
of
a
favorable
pharmacological
effect
of
bexarotene
on
atherosclerosis
despite
the
induction
of
hypertriglyceridemia
,
likely
via
a
beneficial
action
on
intestinal
absorption
and
macrophage
efflux
.
GABA-induced

Thymidylate
kinase
(
TMPK
)
is
a
key
enzyme
for
pyrimidine
synthesis
that
catalyzes
the
phosphorylation
of
thymidine
5'-monophosphate
(
dTMP
)
in
the
presence
of
ATP
and
Mg
(
2
+
)
to
form
thymidine
5'-diphosphate
(
dTDP
)
,
which
is
then
converted
to
thymidine
5'-triphosphate
(
dTTP
)
by
nucleoside-diphosphate
kinase
(
NDK
)
.

TMPK
has
an
important
function
in
cell
proliferation
and
its
enzyme
kinetics
and
related
structures
have
been
determined
in
various
organisms
.

TMPK
is
well
recognized
as
a
potential
drug
target
,
with
the
most
notable
function
being
in
the
activation
of
anti-HIV
nucleoside
prodrugs
.

Recent
studies
have
shown
that
TMPK
is
a
validated
target
for
antibiotic
development
against
gram-positive
bacterium
of
Staphylococcus
aureus
.

In
addition
,
inhibition
of
human
TMPK
increases
the
potential
of
anticancer
agent
doxorubicin
toward
colon
cancer
cells
regardless

Following

interests

by

norepinephrine
(

)
,
adenosine

-free
and
high
K
(

)
,
Ca
(

-free
solution
.

The
EFS-evoked
contractions
were
more
sensitive
to
resveratrol
and
to
NS1619-selective
openers
of
big
calcium-sensitive
(
BK
(
Ca
)
)
channels
,
than
NE-evoked
contractions
.

Effects
of
resveratrol
on
the
ATP-evoked
contractions
were
weak
.

Blockers
of
BK
(
Ca
)
channels
partly
inhibited
the
effect
of
resveratrol
only
in
EFS-contracted
preparations
.

Western
blotting
showed
that
RPV
expressed
K

Ca

protein
.

Inhibitors
of
ATP-
and
voltage-sensitive
K
(
+
)
channels
did
not
modify
the
effects
of
resveratrol
.

None
of
the
antagonists
of
K
(
+
)
channels
affected
the
resveratrol
inhibition
of
NE-evoked
contractions
and
effect
of
high
concentrations
of
resveratrol
on
the
EFS-evoked
contractions
.

Resveratrol
more
potently
inhibited
CaCl
(
2
)
than
potassium
chloride
contractions
of
RPV
.

Thus
,
BK
(
Ca
)
channels
partly
mediate
the
inhibitory
effect
of
resveratrol
on
the
neurogenic
contractions
of
RPV
.

The

be
involved
in
the
effects
of
resveratrol

of
RPV
.

Our
results

β-Cell
lipotoxicity
is
thought
to
play
an
important
role
in
the
development
of
type
2
diabetes
.

However
,
no
study
has
examined
its
role
in
type
1
diabetes
,
which
could
be
clinically
relevant
for
slow-onset
type
1
diabetes
.

Reports
of
enhanced
cytokine
toxicity
in
fat-laden
islets
are
consistent
with
the
hypothesis
that
lipid
and
cytokine
toxicity
may
be
synergistic
.

Thus
,
β-cell
lipotoxicity
could
be
enhanced
in
models
of
autoimmune
diabetes
.

To
determine
this
,
we
examined
the
effects
of
prolonged
free
fatty
acids
elevation
on
β-cell
secretory
function
in
the
prediabetic
diabetes-prone
BioBreeding
(
dp-BB
)
rat
,
its
diabetes-resistant
BioBreeding
(
dr-BB
)
control
,
and
normal
Wistar-Furth
(
WF
)
rats
.

Rats
received
a
48-h
iv
infusion
of
saline
or
Intralipid
plus
heparin
(
IH
)
(
to
elevate
free
fatty
acid
levels
~2-fold
)
followed
by
hyperglycemic
clamp
or
islet
secretion
studies
ex
vivo
.

IH
significantly
decreased
β-cell
function
,
assessed
both
by
the
disposition
index
(
insulin
secretion
corrected
for
IH-induced
insulin
resistance
)
and
in
isolated
islets
,
in
dp-BB
,
but
not
in
dr-BB
or
WF
,
rats
,
and
the
effect
of
IH
was
inhibited
by
the
antioxidant
N-acetylcysteine
.

Furthermore
,
IH
significantly
increased
islet
cytokine
mRNA
and
plasma
cytokine
levels
(
monocyte
chemoattractant
protein-1
and
IL-10
)
in
dp-BB
,
but
not
in
dr-BB
or
WF
,
rats
.

All
dp-BB
rats
had
mononuclear
infiltration
of
islets
,
which
was
absent
in
dr-BB
and
WF
rats
.

In
conclusion
,
the
presence
of
insulitis
was
permissive
for
IH-induced
β-cell
dysfunction
in
the
BB
rat
,
which
suggests
a
link
between
β-cell
lipotoxicity
and
islet
inflammation
.
Low
levels
of
serotonin
may
reduce
the
density
of
the
serotonin
transporter
(
SERT
)
by
either
increasing
trafficking
or
reducing
synthesis;
a
"neuroadaptive
response"
.

To
determine
whether
3
,
4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine
(
MDMA
)
-induced
reductions
in
SERT
density
could
be
related
to
such
a
mechanism
,
p-chlorophenylalanine
or
MDMA
was
administered
to
rats
,
and
brain
serotonin
and
SERT
density
were
measured
.

As
expected
,
both
treatments
led
to
serotonin
depletion
1
,
7
and
14
days
later
.

However
,
only
MDMA
reduced
SERT
density
.

This
observation
suggests
that
MDMA-induced
reductions
in
SERT
density
do
not
represent
neuroadaptive
responses
to
decreased
levels
of
brain
serotonin
,
but
may
occur
in
response
to
some
other
stimulus
or
to
the
neurotoxic
effects
of
MDMA
.

Activating

insertions
in
the
juxtamembrane
domain
of
the
FLT3
tyrosine
kinase
are
found
in
about
one
fourth
of
patients
with
acute
myeloid
leukemia
and
have
been
shown
to
be
an
independent
negative
prognostic
factor
for
survival
.

We
show
that
sorafenib
(
BAY

,
Nexavar
)
potently
inhibits
FLT3
enzymatic
and
signaling
activities
.

In
HEK293
cells
stably
transfected
with
FLT3-WT
or
FLT3-ITD
,
sorafenib
blocked
basal
and
ligand
dependent
FLT3-mediated
tyrosine
autophosphorylation
as
well
as
extracellular
signal-regulated
kinase1
/

and
Stat5
phosphorylation
.

In
leukemia
cell
lines
MV4-11
and
EOL-1
,
sorafenib
treatment
resulted
in
decreased
cell
proliferation
and
inhibition
of
FLT3
signaling
.

The
growth
of
the
FLT3-independent
RS4-11
cell
line
was
only
weakly
inhibited
by
sorafenib
.

Cell
cycle
arrest
and
induction
of
apoptosis
were
observed
upon
treatment
with
sorafenib
in
MV4-11
and
EOL-1
cells
.

The
antitumor
efficacy
of
sorafenib
was
evaluated
against
the
MV4-11
leukemia
grown
subcutaneously
in
NCr

mice
.

Doses
of
3

10
mg

administered
orally
for
14
days
resulted
in
six
and
nine
out
of
10
animals
with
complete
responses
,
respectively
.

The
demonstration
that
sorafenib
exhibits
potent
target
inhibition
and
efficacy
in
FLT3-driven
models
suggests
that
this
compound
may
have
a
therapeutic
benefit
for
patients
with
FLT3-driven
leukemias

BACKGROUND
:

for

Rasagiline
[
N-propargyl-l
(
R
)
-aminoindan
]
is
a
second-generation
propargylamine
pharmacophore
that
selectively
and
irreversibly
inhibits
brain
MAO-B
and
is
specifically
designed
for
the
treatment
of
Parkinson's
disease
(
PD
)
.

OBJECTIVE
:
The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
review
the
pharmacology
,
tolerability
,
and
clinical
efficacy
of
rasagiline
in
the
treatment
of
PD
.

METHODS
:
MEDLINE
(
1966-April
2007
)
,
the
Cochrane
Database
of
Systematic
Reviews
,
and
International
Pharmaceutical
Abstracts
(
1970-April
2007
)
were
searched
for
original
research
and
review
articles
published
in
English
.

The
search
terms
were
monoamine
oxidase
,
neuroprotection
,
Parkinson
disease
,
propargylamine
,
rasagiline
,
and
selegiline
.

The
reference
lists
of
articles
were
also
consulted
,
as
was
information
provided
by
the
manufacturer
of
rasagiline
.

RESULTS
:
Data
from
63
clinical
and
laboratory
studies
were
analyzed
.

Based
on
the
results
from
those
studies
,
we
concluded
that
rasagiline
PO
QD
,
at
the
therapeutic
dosage
range
of
0
.
5
to
1
rag
/
d
,
is
effective
and
well
tolerated
and
completely
,
selectively
,
and
specifically
inhibited
MAO-B
.

Pharmacologically
,
rasagiline
was
found
to
be
<
or
=
10-fold
more
potent
than
selegiline
and
was
not
metabolized
to
amphetamine
derivatives
.

Rasagiline
was
effective
both
as
monotherapy
in
early
PD
and
as
adjunctive
treatment
in
patients
with
advancing
PD
and
motor
fluctuations
.

As
monotherapy
,
rasagiline
provided
modest
yet
clinically
meaningful
benefit
.

A
randomized
,
double-blind
,
placebo-controlled
study
found
that
,
after
26
weeks
of
treatment
,
the
adjusted
effect
size
for
total
Unified
Parkinson's
Disease
Rating
Scale
score
was
-4
.
20
(
95%
CI
,

.
66
to

73
)
for
rasagiline
1
mg
/
d
versus
placebo
(
P
<
0
.
001
)
.

Preliminary
long-term
data
from
an
open-label
study
suggest
a
sustained
therapeutic
advantage
when
rasagiline
is
initiated
early
(
before
the
need
for
dopaminergic
agents
)
rather
than
later
.

In
patients
with
more
advanced
disease
who
received
treatment
with
dopaminergic
agents
,
rasagiline
and
entacapone
were
associated
with
reductions
of
"off"
time
significantly
greater
than
placebo
(
-1
.

and
-1
.

vs

hour;
both
,
P

or

)
.

Rasagiline
was
well
tolerated
in
younger
(
aged
<;70
years
)
and
older
(
aged
>
or
=
70
years
)
patients
with
early
or
advanced
PD
.

Pharmacologically
,
rasagiline
has
the
potential
to
augment
the
vasopressor
effects
of
diet-derived
tyramine
(
ie
,
the
"cheese
reaction"
)
.

However
,
clinical
challenge
studies
of
tyramine
have
found
this
unlikely
to
occur
even
with
ingestion
of
supraphysiologic
amounts
of
tyramine
.

In
experimental
models
,
rasagiline
has
been
found
to
have
neuroprotective
properties
that
may
be
independent
of
MAO-B
inhibition
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
Based
on
this
review
,
rasagiline
has
been
found
to
be
well
tolerated
and
effective
in
the
treatment
of
early
PD
and
as
adjunctive
treatment
in
motor
fluctuations
.

Whether
rasagiline
is
associated
with
clinically
significant
neuroprotection
(
ie
,
disease
modification
)
in
PD
is
the
subject
of
ongoing
clinical
trials
.
Trichostatin
A
(
TSA
)
has
been
shown
to
prevent
fibrosis
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
.

The
present
study
aimed
at
investigating
the
role
of
reactive
oxygen
species
(
ROS
)
scavenging
by
TSA
on
transforming
growth
factor-β
(
TGF-β
)
-induced
myofibroblast
differentiation
of
corneal
fibroblasts
in
vitro
.

Human
immortalized
corneal
fibroblasts
were
treated
with
TGF-β
in
the
presence
of
TSA
,
the
NAD
(
P
)
H
oxidase
inhibitor
diphenyleneiodonium
(
DPI
)
,
the
antioxidant
N-acetyl-cysteine
(
NAC
)
,
the
NF-E2-related
factor
2-antioxidant
response
element
(
Nrf2-ARE
)
activator
sulforaphane
,
or
small
interfering
RNA
.

Myofibroblast
differentiation
was
assessed
by
α-smooth
muscle
actin
(
α-SMA
)
expression
,
F-actin
bundle
formation
,
and
collagen
gel
contraction
.

ROS
,
H
(
2
)
O
(
2
)
,
intracellular
glutathione
(
GSH
)
level
,
cellular
total
antioxidant
capacity
,
and
the
activation
of
Nrf2-ARE
signaling
were
determined
with
various
assays
.

Treatment
with
TSA
and
the
Nrf2-ARE
activator
resulted
in
increased
inhibition
of
the
TGF-β-induced
myofibroblast
differentiation
as
compared
with
treatment
with
DPI
or
NAC
.

Furthermore
,
TSA
also
decreased
cellular
ROS
and
H
(
2
)
O
(
2
)
accumulation
induced
by
TGF-β
,
whereas
it
elevated
intracellular
GSH
level
and
cellular
total
antioxidant
capacity
.

In
addition
,
TSA
induced
Nrf2
nuclear
translocation
and
up-regulated
the
expression
of
Nrf2-ARE
downstream
antioxidant
genes
,
whereas
Nrf2
knockdown
by
RNA
interference
blocked
the
inhibition
of
TSA
on
myofibroblast
differentiation
.

In
conclusion
,
this
study
provides
the
first
evidence
implicating
that
TSA
inhibits
TGF-β-induced
ROS
accumulation
and
myofibroblast
differentiation
via
enhanced
Nrf2-ARE
signaling
.

Glycine
and
gamma-aminobutyric
acid
(
GABA
)
are
the
major
inhibitory
neurotransmitters
in
the
retina
.

Approximately
half
of
the
amacrine
cells
release
glycine
at
their
synapses
with
bipolar
,
other
amacrine
,
and
ganglion
cells
.

Whereas
the
retinal
distributions
of
glycine
receptor
(
GlyR
)
subunits
alpha1
,
alpha2
,
and
alpha3
have
been
mapped
,
the
role
of
the
alpha4
subunit
in
retinal
circuitry
remains
unclear
.

A
rabbit
polyclonal
antiserum
was
raised
against
a
peptide
that
comprises
the
C-terminal
14
amino
acids
of
the
mouse
GlyR
alpha4
subunit
.

Using
immunocytochemistry
,
we
localized
the
alpha4
subunit
in
the
inner
plexiform
layer
(
IPL
)
in
brightly
fluorescent
puncta
,
which
represent
postsynaptically
clustered
GlyRs
.

This
was
shown
by
double-labeling
sections
for
GlyR
alpha4
and
synaptic
markers
(
bassoon
,
gephyrin
)
.

Double-labeling
sections
for
GlyR
alpha4
and
the
other
GlyR
alpha
subunits
shows
that
they
are
mostly
clustered
at
different
synapses;
however
,
approximately
30%
of
the
alpha4-containing
synapses
also
express
the
alpha2
subunit
.

We
also
studied
the
pre-
and
postsynaptic
partners
at
GlyR
alpha4-containing
synapses
and
found
that
displaced
(
ON-
)
cholinergic
amacrine
cells
prominently
expressed
the
alpha4
subunit
.

The
density
of
GlyR
alpha4-expressing
synapses
in
wildtype
,
Glra1
(
ot
/
ot
)
,
and
Glra3
(
-
/
-
)
mouse
retinas
did
not
differ
significantly
.

Thus
,
there
is
no
apparent
compensation
of
the
loss
of
alpha1
or
alpha3
subunits
by
an
upregulation
of
alpha4
subunit
gene
expression;
however
,
the
alpha2
subunit
is
moderately
upregulated
.
PURPOSE
:
Talampanel
(

)
,
a
potent
and
selective
alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate
(
AMPA
)
-receptor
antagonist
,
is
a
potential
new
antiepileptic
drug
(
AED
)
.

This
study
examines
the
single-
and
multiple-dose
pharmacokinetics
,
safety
,
and
tolerability
of
talampanel
in
patients
with
intractable
epilepsy
and
assesses
the
potential
for
pharmacokinetic
interaction
.

METHODS
:
Eleven
of
14
patients
entered
into
the
study
completed
.

Fourteen
patients
were
evaluated
for
safety
,
13
patients
were
used
in
the
single-dose
,
and
11
patients
in
the
multiple-dose
pharmacokinetic
analysis
.

Each
patient
initially
received
a
single
35-mg
dose
of
talampanel
followed
by
the
measurement
of
pharmacokinetic
profiles
.

A
21-day

dosing
regimen
was
then
determined
for
each
patient
based
on
his
or
her
initial
pharmacokinetic
profile
.

Adverse
events
were
recorded
by
patients
or
their
carers
.

RESULTS
:
After
oral
ingestion
,
talampanel
was
rapidly
absorbed
,
with
maximal
plasma
concentrations
achieved
within
1-3
h
.

Talampanel
concentrations
in
patients
taking
enzyme-inducing
AEDs
were
50%
lower
than
those
seen
in
healthy
volunteers
.

Mean

values
were

compared
with

in
healthy
volunteers
.

After
multiple-dose
and

values
were
increased
to

h
Talampanel
and
valproic
acid
(
VPA
)
appear
to
inhibit
each
other's
metabolism
mutually
.

Talampanel
had
no
effect
on
plasma
concentrations
of
other
AEDs
.

Multiple-dose
talampanel
administration
was
associated
with
nonlinear
pharmacokinetics
.

No
serious
adverse
events
were
reported;
the
most
frequently
reported
being
dizziness
,
ataxia
,
drowsiness
,
and
headaches
CONCLUSIONS
:
Talampanel
dosing
strategies
may
be
reliant
on
concomitant
AED
medication
,
as
enzyme-inducing
AEDs
enhance
,
whereas
VPA
inhibits
its
metabolism
.

Talampanel
was
well
tolerated
,
although
adverse
events
occurred
at
lower
doses
compared
with
those
in
healthy
subjects
,
probably
because
of
the
additive
effect
of
concomitant
AEDs
.

The

has
captured
tremendous
interest
during
the
past
a
few
years
because
of
(

its
increasingly

thus
its

,
and
(

its

Specifically
,
the

deacetylation
is
not

increased
more

These
results
strongly
suggest
that
greater
expression
of
the
genes
encoding

is
closely
related
to
the
increased

.

These
effects
were
fully
counteracted
by
dietary
phenolics
which
inhibited
ROS
overproduction
and
GSH
consumption
,
rendered
the
reactive

unnecessary
and
blocked

Altogether
,
these

suggest
that

system
hijacks
intestinal

an

ABSTRACT
TRUNCATED

This
study
was
designed
to
evaluate
the
effectiveness
of
crocin
,
main
component
of
Crocus
sativus
L
.

(
Saffron
)
against
subchronic
diazinon
(
DZN
)
induced
cardiotoxicity
in
rats
.

METHODS
:
Rats
were
divided
into
7
groups;
control
(
corn

)
,
DZN

)
plus
DZN
and

p
)
groups
.

Treatments
were
continued
for
4weeks
.

Creatine
phosphokinase
MB
(
CK-MB
)
,
malondealdehyde
(
MDA
)
and
glutathione
(
GSH
)
levels
were
evaluated
in
heart
tissue
at
the
end
of
treatments
.

Levels
of
apoptotic
proteins
(
Bax
,
Bcl2
,
caspase
3
)
and
cytosolic
cytochrome
c
were
analyzed
by
Western
blotting
.

Transcript
levels
of
Bax
and
Bcl2
were
also
determined
using
qRT
PCR
.

RESULTS
:
DZN
induced
histophatological
damages
and
elevated
the
level
of
cardiac
marker
CK-MB
.

These
effects
were
associated
with
increased
MDA
level
,
lower
level
of
reduced
GSH
and
induction
of
apoptosis
through
elevation
of
Bax
/
Bcl2
ratio
(
both
protein
and
mRNA
levels
)
,
cytochrome
c
release
to
the
cytosol
and
activation
caspase
3
in
cardiac
tissue
.

Crocin
(
25
and
50mg
/
kg
)
or
vitamin
E
improved
histopathological
damages
,
decreased
MDA
and
CK-MB
,
increased
GSH
content
and
attenuated
the
increase
of
Bax
/
Bcl2
ratio
,
activation
of
caspase
3
and
release
of
cytochrome
c
to
the
cytosol
induced
by
DZN
.

In
summary
,
DZN
induced
mitochondrial-mediated
apoptosis
in
heart
tissue
of
rat
following
subchronic
exposure
.

Crocin
,
as
an
antioxidant
,
showed
protective
effects
against
DZN
cardiotoxicity
by
reducing
lipid
peroxidation
and
alleviating
apoptosis
.
The
present
study
investigates
enzyme
activities
of
the
urea
cycle
,
transamidinase
and
ornithine-proline
inter-conversion
in
the
hypertrophied
kidney
after
unilateral
nephrectomy
in
mice
.

Surgical
removal
of
the
left
kidney
in
mice
led
to
compensatory
enlargement
of
the
right
kidney
after
1
and
14
days
.

This
renal
growth
was
associated
with
an
increase
in
glomerular
volume
(
but
not
number
)
and
enlargement
of
the
proximal
convoluted
tubules
.

The
total
renal
protein
content
increased
in
proportion
to
the
increase
in
kidney
weight
,
but
the
protein
per
gram
weight
of
kidney
did
not
change
.

The
specific
activity
of
only
ornithine
aminotransferase
(
OAT
)
,
the
rate-limiting
enzyme
in
the
conversion
of
ornithine
to
proline
,
increased
in
2
weeks
of
hypertrophy
.

The
specific
activity
of
all
other
enzymes
was
unchanged
.

However
,
the
total
enzyme
activity
per
kidney
of
all
the
enzymes
,
without
exception
,
was
elevated
in
the
hypertrophied
kidney
.

While
the
increase
in
total
OAT
activity
was
much
more
than
the
increase
in
kidney
weight
,
all
other
enzymes
increased
more
or
less
in
proportion
to
the
increase
in
renal
mass
.

The
results
suggest
that
compensation
in
OAT
activity
to
chronic
reduction
in
renal
mass
was
complete
,
but
only
partial
in
the
case
of
other
enzymes
.

In
the
present
investigation
,
16
new
rotundic
acid
(
RA
)
derivatives
modified
at
the
C-3
,
C-23
and
C-28
positions
were
synthesized
.

The
cytotoxicities
of
the
derivatives
were
evaluated
against
HeLa
,
A375
,
HepG2
,
SPC-A1
and
NCI-H446
human
tumor
cell
lines
by
MTT
assay
.

Among
these
derivatives
,
compounds
4-7
exhibited
stronger
cell
growth
inhibitory
than
RA
and
compound
4
was
found
to
be
the
best
inhibition
activity
on
five
human
tumor
cell
lines
with
IC50
<10μM
.

The
apoptosis
mechanism
of
compound
4
in
HeLa
cells
was
investigated
by
western
blot
analysis
.

The
results
indicated
that
compound
4
could
induce
apoptosis
through
increasing
protein
expression
of
cleaved
caspase-3
and
Bax
,
and
decreasing
protein
expression
of
Bcl-2
.

In
summary
,
the
present
work
suggests
that
compound
4
might
serve
as
an
effective
chemotherapeutic
candidate
.
Arsenic
trioxide
(
ATO
)
is
widely
used
in
tumor
treatment
,
but
excessive
arsenic
exposure
can
have
adverse
effects
.

We
recently
found
that
,
in
primary
osteoblasts
,
ATO
produces
oxidative
stress
and
causes
DNA
tailing
,
but
does
not
induce
apoptosis
.

We
further
examined
the
signaling
pathway
by
which
osteoblasts
survive
ATO
treatment
,
and
found
that
they
were
arrested
at
G2
/
M
phase
of
the
cell
cycle
at
30h
and
overrode
the
G2
/
M
boundary
at
48h
.

After
treatment
for
30h
,
there
was
increased
Cdc2
phosphorylation
and
expression
of
Wee1
,
a
Cdc2
kinase
,
and
expression
of
the
cell
cycle
inhibitor
,
p21
(
waf1
/
cip1
)
,
which
interacts
with
Cdc2
.

Furthermore
,
levels
of
the
phosphatase
Cdc25C
,
which
activates
Cdc2
,
were
decreased
,
while
the
ratio
of
its
phosphorylated
/
inactivated
form
to
the
total
amount
was
increased
.

Moreover
,
phosphorylation
/
activation
of
the
checkpoint
kinases
Chk1
,
Chk2
and
p53
levels
were
increased
,
as
were
levels
of
activated
ATM
and
γ-H2AX
.

The
cell
viability
was
decreased
as
an
ATM
inhibitor
was
added
.

Additionally
,
these
effects
of
ATO
on
γ-H2AX
,
Chk1
,
Chk2
,
p53
,
and
p21
(
waf1
/
cip1
)
were
reduced
by
an
ATM
inhibitor
.

These
findings
suggest
that
G2
/
M
phase
arrest
of
osteoblasts
is
mediated
by
Chk1
/
Chk2
activation
via
an
ATM-dependent
pathway
by
which
osteoblasts
survive
.

Persistent
hyperglycemia
is
associated
with
chronic
oxidative
stress
which
contributes
to
the
development
and
progression
of
diabetes-associated
complications
.

The
sensitivity
of
pancreatic
β-cells
to
oxidative
stress
has
been
attributed
to
their
low
content
of
antioxidants
compared
with
other
tissues
.

Bioactive
compounds
with
potent
antidiabetic
properties
have
been
shown
to
ameliorate
hyperglycemia
mediated
oxidative
stress
.

Recently
,
we
have
reported
that
oral
administration
of
fisetin
(
10
mg
/
Kg

.

w
.

)
,
a
bioflavonoid
found
to
be
present
in
strawberries
,
persimmon
,
to
STZ-induced
experimental
diabetic
rats
significantly
improved
normoglycemia
.

The
present
study
was
aimed
to
evaluate
the
antioxidant
potential
of
fisetin
in
both
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
.

Diabetes
was
induced
by
single
intraperitoneal
injection
of
streptozotocin
(
50
mg
/
kg
body
weight
)
.

Fisetin
was
administered
orally
for
30
days
.

At
the
end
of
the
study
,
all
animals
were
killed
.

Blood
samples
were
collected
for
the
biochemical
estimations
.

The
antioxidant
status
was
evaluated
.

Histological
examinations
were
performed
on
pancreatic
tissues
.

Fisetin
treatment
showed
a
significant
decline
in
the
levels
of
blood
glucose
,
glycosylated
hemoglobin
(
HbA1c
)
,
NF-kB
p65
unit
(
in
pancreas
)
and
IL-1β
(
plasma
)
,
serum
nitric
oxide
(
NO
)
with
an
elevation
in
plasma
insulin
.

The
treatment
also
improved
the
antioxidant
status
in
pancreas
as
well
as
plasma
of
diabetic
rats
indicating
the
antioxidant
potential
of
fisetin
.

In
addition
,
the
results
of
DPPH
and
ABTS
assays
substantiate
the
free
radical
scavenging
activity
of
fisetin
.

Histological
studies
of
the
pancreas
also
evidenced
the
tissue
protective
nature
of
fisetin
.

It
is
concluded
that
,
fisetin
possesses
antioxidant
and
anti-inflammatory
property
and
may
be
considered
as
an
adjunct
for
the
treatment
of
diabetes
.
The
serotonin
(
5-HT
)
receptors
of
type
6
(
5-HT6
)
are
quite
different
from
all
other
5-HT
receptors
,
as
they
include
a
short
third
cytoplasmatic
loop
and
a
long
C-terminal
tail
,
and
one
intron
located
in
the
middle
of
the
third
cytoplasmatic
loop
.

A
lot
of
controversies
still
exist
regarding
their
binding
affinity
,
effects
of
5-HT6
ligands
on
brain
catecholamines
,
behavioral
syndromes
regulated
by
them
,
and
brain
distribution
.

In
spite
of
the
lack
of
information
on
metabolic
pattern
of
the
various
compounds
,
some
of
5-HT6
receptor
ligands
entered
the
clinical
development
as
potential
anti-dementia
,
antipsychotic
,
antidepressant
and
anti-obese
drugs
.

The
present
paper
is
a
comprehensive
review
on
the
state
of
art
of
the
5-HT6
receptors
,
while
highlighting
the
potential
clinical
applications
of
5-HT6
receptor
agonists
/
antagonists
.
A
series
of
compounds
based
on
a
4-phenyl-2-phenylaminopyridine
scaffold
that
are
potent
and
selective
inhibitors
of
Traf2-
and
Nck-interacting
kinase
(
TNIK
)
activity
are
described
.

These
compounds
were
used
as
tools
to
test
the
importance
of
TNIK
kinase
activity
in
signaling
and
proliferation
in
Wnt-activated
colorectal
cancer
cells
.

The
results
indicate
that
pharmacological
inhibition
of
TNIK
kinase
activity
has
minimal
effects
on
either
Wnt
/
TCF4
/
β-catenin-driven
transcription
or
viability
.

The
findings
suggest
that
the
kinase
activity
of
TNIK
may
be
less
important
to
Wnt
signaling
than
other
aspects
of
TNIK
function
,
such
as
its
putative
role
in
stabilizing
the
TCF4
/
β-catenin
transcriptional
complex

Recent
findings
have
implicated
the
5-hydroxytryptamine

5-HT2B
)
serotonin
receptor
in
mediating
the
heart
valve

]
and
primary

hypertension
observed
in
patients
taking
the
now-banned
appetite
suppressant
fenfluramine
(
Pondimin
,
Redux
)
.

Via
large-scale
,
random
screening
of
a
portion
of
the
receptorome
,
we
have
discovered
that
the
amphetamine
derivative
3
,
4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine
(
MDMA
,
"Ecstasy"
)
and
its
N-demethylated
metabolite
3
,
4-methylenedioxyamphetamine
(
MDA
)
each
preferentially
bind
to
and
activate
human
recombinant
5-HT2B
receptors
.

We
also
demonstrate
that
MDMA
and
MDA
,
like
fenfluramine
and
its
N-deethylated
metabolite
norfenfluramine
,
elicit
prolonged
mitogenic
responses
in
human
valvular
interstitial
cells
via
activation
of
5-HT2B
receptors
.

We
also
report
that
pergolide
and
dihydroergotamine
,
two
drugs
recently
demonstrated
to
induce
VHD
in

,
potently
activate

,
thus
validating
this

for
its
ability
to
predict

that
might

factor
that
mediates
the
inducible
expression
of
a
variety
of
genes
involved
in

induces
numerous

Here

In
recent
years
the
use
of
the
opioid
oxycodone
has
increased
markedly
and
replacing
morphine
as
the
first-line
choice
of
opioid
in
several
countries
.

There
are
formulations
for
oral
immediate
,
oral
extended
release
and
intravenous
use
.

The
bioavailability
is
higher
than
for
morphine
and
less
variable
.

Oxycodone
is
primarily
metabolized
in
the
liver
by
the
cytochrome
P450
(
CYP
)
enzymes
with
CYP3A
as
the
major
metabolic
pathway
and
CYP2D6
as
the
minor
metabolic
pathway
to
noroxycodone
,
oxymorphone
and
noroxymorphone
.

Oxycodone
exerts
its
analgesic
effect
via
the
µ-opioid
receptor
.

The
metabolism
of
CYP2D6
substrates
varies
to
a
large
degree
between
individuals
as
a
result
of
allele
functionality
.

Poor
metabolizers
(
PM
)
have
two
non-functional
alleles
,
extensive
metabolizers
(
EM
)
are
homozygous
with
two
functional
alleles
or
heterozygous
with
one
functional
allele
and
ultrarapid
metabolizers
(
UM
)
have
more
than
two
functional
alleles
.

There
are
pronounced
interethnic
differences
in
the
allele
distribution
.

On
the
basis
of
studies
performed
thus
far
,
oxycodone
concentrations
in
comparison
with
EM
are
similar
in
PM
and
reduced
in
UM
.

The
pharmacokinetics
in
UM
are
insufficiently
investigated
.

Simultaneous
inhibition
of
both
CYP3A
and
CYP2D6
results
in
increased
oxycodone
concentrations
and
such
a
combination
should
be
avoided
.

A
similar
effect
is
to
be
expected
with
use
of
a
CYP3A
inhibitor
in
CYP2D6
PM
.

Concomitant
use
of
enzyme
inducers
such
as
rifampicin
,
St
John's
wort
and
carbamazepine
should
be
avoided
because
of
the
risk
of
subtherapeutic
concentrations
of
oxycodone
.

When
the
dosage
of
morphine
may
result
in
unpredictable
bioavailability
,
like
in
patients
with
severe
hepatic
cirrhosis
,
oxycodone
might
be
beneficial
because
it
has
higher
and
less
variability
in
bioavailability
between
patients
than
morphine
.
5-aminosalicylic
acid
(
5-ASA
)
preparations
(
eg
,
mesalazine
,
mesalamine
)
are
well-established
preparations
used
in
the
management
of
inflammatory
bowel
disease
.

These
drugs
are
most
useful
for
the
treatment
of
mild
to
moderate
flares
of
ulcerative
colitis
and
,
especially
,
for
maintenance
of
remission
.

Although
most
gastroenterologists
are
very
familiar
with
these
drugs
,
the
interest
in
these
drugs
has
undergone
a
resurgence
,
with
new
preparations
offering
convenience
and
high
dosage
,
while
preserving
their
customary
safety
.

New
dosage
regimens
are
likely
to
become
standard
practice
in
the
near
future
.

There
is
also
considerable
interest
in
chemoprevention
of
colorectal
cancer
in
the
context
of
inflammatory
bowel
disease
,
and
the
role
of
long-term
maintenance
therapy
with
5-ASAs
in
achieving
such
chemoprevention
.

A
mechanism
of
action
for
such
chemoprevention
has
been
provided
by
the
agonism
of
the
peroxisome
proliferator-activated
receptor-gamma
by
5-ASA
,
which
unifies
its
efficacy
as
an
anti-inflammatory
and
chemopreventive
agent
.

In
the
future
,
even
more
effective
agents
based
on
5-ASA
are
expected
,
based
on
more
powerful
agonism
of
peroxisome
proliferator-activated
receptor-gamma;
5-ASA
preparations
have

once
daily
for

needle
in

,
without

period
.

No
apparent
differences
in
local
tolerance
were
observed
.

Most
injections
(
87

5%
)
gave
either
no
or
only
a
mild
reaction
.

Of
the
moderate
reactions

redness
were
reported
most
frequently
(
overall

9

,
respectively
)
.

Administration
by
Medi-Jector
was
bioequivalent
to
conventional
needle
injection
with
respect
to
the
peak
concentration
and
area
under
the
curve
.

A
profound
suppression
of

Serum
oestradiol
and
progesterone
concentrations
were
relatively
low
prior
to

and
remained

during
the
entire

period
.

In
conclusion
,
administration
of
a

might
be
useful

The
effects
of
phosphatidylcholine
(

investigated
.

PC
protected
all
of

studied
against
both

to

Emulsification
of

,
which
was
further
enhanced

The

suggesting
that

may
contribute
to
the

In

the
efficacy
of

was
generally
similar
to
standard
dosages
of

and

,
terfenadine
,
chlorpheniramine
and

in
patients
with
perennial

.

The
most
frequent
adverse
events
reported
during
ebastine
therapy
are
drowsiness
,
headache
and
dry

,
the
incidence
being
similar

Serious

observed
on
rare

and
there
has

This
study
showed
that

.

On

other
hand
,
an

increase
of

glycoprotein
acid
has
been
observed
in
boys
with
vitamin
A
deficiency
.

The
vitamin
A
deficiency
observed
in
this
survey
is
due
to
a
micronutrients
deficiency
in
the
diet
which
is
essentially
based
on
glucides
.

The
positive
correlation
between
vitamin
A
and
immunoglobulin

concentrations
might
be
the
result
of
the

.

The
isolated
increasing
of
alpha-1
glycoprotein
acid
in
boys
with
vitamin
A

has
been
assigned
to
the
ecosensitiveness
of
the

environment
.

We
therefore
concluded
that
,
in
Ivorian
primary-school-aged
children
with
vitamin
A
deficiency
,
nutritional
,
immunity

inflammatory
proteins
which
are
modified
are

When

of
a

to
which
are
attached
discrete
N-terminal
regulatory
domains

whereas
the

enzyme
contains

atom
bound

have

Although

OBJECTIVE
:
Ziprasidone
is
an
atypical
antipsychotic
drug
that
shows
a
higher
affinity
for
serotonin
5-HT
(
2
)
receptors
compared
with
dopamine
D
(
2
)
receptors
in
vitro
.

The
affinity
of
ziprasidone
for
these
receptors
in
vivo
in
patients
was
examined
in
a
positron
emission
tomography
(
PET
)
study
.

METHOD
:
The
authors
conducted
a
PET
study
to
evaluate
D
(
2
)
occupancy
(
using
[
(
11
)
C
]
raclopride
)
and
5-HT
(
2
)
occupancy
(
using
[
(
18
)
F
]
setoperone
)
in
brain
regions
of
interest
in
16
patients
with
schizophrenia
or
schizoaffective
disorder
randomly
assigned
to
receive
40
,
80
,
120
,
or
160
mg
/
day
of
ziprasidone
,
which
reflected
the
recommended
dose
range
.

PET
scanning
was
done
after
3
weeks
of
administration
and
at
trough
plasma
levels
,
i
.

e
.

,
12-16
hours
after
the
last
dose
.

RESULTS
:
The
mean
5-HT
(
2
)
receptor
occupancy
was
significantly
higher
than
the
mean
D
(
2
)
receptor
occupancy
(
mean
=
76%
,
SD
=
15%
,
and
mean
=
56%
,
SD
=
18%
,
respectively
)
.

The
estimated
plasma
ziprasidone
concentration
associated
with
50%
maximal
5-HT
(
2
)
receptor
occupancy
was
almost
four
times
lower
than
that
for
D
(
2
)
receptor
occupancy
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
These
data
affirm
that
ziprasidone
is
similar
to
other
novel
antipsychotics
in
having
greater
5-HT
(
2
)
than
D
(
2
)
receptor
occupancy
at
therapeutic
doses
and
suggest
that
the
optimal
effective
dose
of
ziprasidone
is
closer
to
120
mg
/
day
than
to
the
lower
doses
suggested
by
previous
PET
studies
.

The
relatively
high
D
(
2
)
receptor
occupancy
,
even
at
trough
plasma
levels
,
suggests
that
ziprasidone
is
more
similar
to
risperidone
and
olanzapine
in
receptor
occupancy
profile
than
to
clozapine
and
quetiapine
.

Since
ziprasidone
plasma
levels
show
significant
(
more
than
twofold
)
variation
within
a
single
dose
cycle
,
studies
that
are
aimed
at
peak
plasma
levels
(
6
hours
after
the
last
dose
)
and
that
examine
extrastriatal
regions
are
required
to
fully
characterize
the
in
vivo
occupancy
profile
of
ziprasidone
.
Inspired
by
the
water-enhanced
mechanical
gradient
character
of
the
squid
beak
,
we
herein
report
a
nanocomposite
that
mimics
both
the
architecture
and
properties
of
this
interesting
natural
material
.

Similar
to
the
squid
beak
,
we
have
developed
nanocomposites
where
the
degree
of
cross-linking
is
controlled
along
the
length
of
the
film
.

In
this
study
,
we
utilized
tunicate
cellulose
nanocrystals
as
the
nanofiller
that
are
functionalized
with
allyl
moieties
.

Using
photoinduced
thiol-ene
chemistry
,
we
have
been
able
to
cross-link
the
CNC
nanofiller
.

In
the
dry
state
where
strong
CNC
interactions
can
occur
,
only
a
small
mechanical
contrast
is
observed
between
the
cross-linked
and
uncross-linked
samples
.

However
,
when
the
films
are
exposed
to
water
,
which
"switches
off"
the
noncovalent
CNC
interactions
,
a
significant
mechanical
contrast
is
observed
between
the
same
films
.

For
example
,
at
20
wt
%
CNC
(
in
the
dry
film
)
,
an
increase
in
wet
modulus
from
60
to
300
MPa
(
∼500%
increase
)
is
observed
after
photoirradiation
.

Furthermore
,
we
show
that
the
wet
modulus
can
be
controlled
by
altering
the
UV
exposure
time
which
allows
access
to
mechanical
gradient
films
.
Recent
work
has
revealed
cAMP-dependent
phosphorylation
of
the
18-kDa
IP
subunit
of
the
mammalian
complex
I
of
the
respiratory
chain
,
encoded
by
the
nuclear
NDUFS4
gene
(
chromosome
5
)
.

Phosphorylation
of
this
protein
has
been
shown
to
take
place
in
fibroblast
cultures
in
vivo
,
as
well
as
in
isolated
mitochondria
,
which
in
addition
to
the
cytosol
also
contain
,
in
the
inner-membrane
matrix
fraction
,
a
cAMP-dependent
protein
kinase
.

Mitochondria
appear
to
have
a
Ca2
+
-inhibited
phosphatase
,
which
dephosphorylates
the
18-kDa
phosphoprotein
.

In
fibroblast
and
myoblast
cultures
cAMP-dependent
phosphorylation
of
the
18-kDa
protein
is
associated
with
potent
stimulation
of
complex
I
and
overall
respiratory
activity
with
NAD-linked
substrates
.

Mutations
in
the
human
NDUFS4
gene
have
been
found
,
which
in
the
homozygous
state
are
associated
with
deficiency
of
complex
I
and
fatal
neurological
syndrome
.

In
one
case
consisting
of
a
5
bp
duplication
,
which
destroyed
the
phosphorylation
site
,
cAMP-dependent
activation
of
complex
I
was
abolished
in
the
patient's
fibroblast
cultures
.

In
another
case
consisting
of
a
nonsense
mutation
,
leading
to
termination
of
the
protein
after
only
14
residues
of
the
putative
mitochondria
targeting
peptide
,
a
defect
in
the
assembly
of
complex
I
was
found
in
fibroblast
cultures
.
The
TGF-β
signaling
pathway
is
involved
with
multiple
processes
in
the
mammalian
ovary
,
including
primordial
follicle
formation
,
granulosa
cell
(
GC
)
proliferation
,
follicle
atresia
,
ovulation
,
and
feedback
regulation
between
the
pituitary
and
ovary
.

The
transcriptional

SMAD4
is
the
central
component
of
the
canonical
TGF-β
signaling
pathway
.

Smad4
knockout
using
Amhr2-Cre
,
which
is
expressed
in
GCs
of
immature

,
causes
premature
luteinization
.

In
this
study
,
we
specifically
depleted
Smad4
in
GCs
of
preovulatory
follicles
using
Cyp19-Cre
mice
.

As
different
from
results
with
Smad4
(
fl
/
fl
)
;Amhr2-Cre
mice
,
Smad4
depletion
in
preovulatory
follicles
did
not
cause
premature
luteinization
or
suppress
GC
proliferation;
rather
,
it
increased
follicle
atresia
.

In
addition
,
Nppc
and
Npr2
expressions
were
reduced
by
Smad4
depletion;
thus
,
their
effect
of
maintaining
oocyte
meiotic
arrest
was
weakened
in
Smad4
conditional
knockout
mice
.

Smad4
(
fl
/
fl
)
;Cyp19-Cre
female
mice
were
subfertile
and
had
irregular
estrous
cycles
and
ovulation
defects
.

Smad4
knockout
also
blocked
luteinizing
hormone
(
LH
)
-induced
cumulus
expansion
and
follicle
rupture
,
but
not
oocyte
meiotic
resumption
.

Our
results
also
indicated
that
SMAD4
was
required
for
LH-stimulated
activation
of
ERK1
/
2
and
the
expressions
of
ovulation-related
genes
.

The
defects
arising
from
SMAD4
depletion
could
not
be
rescued
by
intra-ovarian
mediators
of
LH
actions
,
such
as
EGF-like
factors
and
prostaglandin
E2
.

Furthermore
,
corpus
lutea
did
not
form
in
Smad4
(
fl
/
fl
)
;Cyp19-Cre
female
mice
,
indicating
that
SMAD4
was
crucial
for
GCs
terminal
differentiation
.

Thus
,
by
characterizing
the
ovarian
phenotypes
of
preovulatory
follicle-specific
Smad4
knockout
mice
,
we
identified
the
developmental
stage-specific
functions
of
the
canonical
TGF-β
signaling
pathway
in
ovulation
and
luteinization
.

First
,
we
prepared
phospholipid
monolayers
incorporating
chelator
lipid
anchors
at
different
molar
fractions
at
the
air

interface
.

The
fine-structures

plane
of
monolayers
were
characterized
by
XRR
in
the
presence
of
Ni
(

(

ions
,
yielding
the
thickness
,

The
observed

Selective

spares

in
cirrhotic
rats
with
ascites
.
Over
the
last
years
,
considerable
progress
has
been
made
for
the
identification
and
characterization
of
drug
transporters
,
and
several
modeling
studies
have
been
undertaken
to
predict
their
effects
on
ADME
profiling
.

Thus
,
this
study
was
focused
on
the
peptide
transporter
hPepT2
,
which
influences
the
regional
pharmacokinetics
in
brain
,
the
reabsorption
from
renal
tubular
fluid
and
the
pulmonary
delivery
.

A
reliable
model
for
hPepT2
was
generated
by
fragments
based
on
the
resolved
structure
of
the
homologue
lactose
permease
LacY
and
the
structure
is
made
available
as
Supplementary
data
.

The
interaction
capacities
of
such
a
model
were
explored
by
docking
a
set
of
75
known
ligands
.

Docking
results
underlined
the
predilection
of
hPepT2
for
highly
hydrophobic
ligands
and
the
key
role
of
ionic
interactions
elicited
by
both
charged
termini
.

The
docking
results
were
further
verified
developing
a
pharmacophore
model
which
clarified
the
key
features
required
for
an
optimal
hPepT2
affinity
and
confirmed
the
main
factors
governing
the
hPepT2
/
hPepT1
selectivity
.

The
soundness
of
the
docking
results
and
the
agreement
with
the
pharmacophore
mapping
afford
an
encouraging
validation
for
the
proposed
hPepT2
model
and
suggest
that
it
can
be
conveniently
exploited
to
design
peptide-like
molecules
with
an
improved
affinity
for
this
transporter

Candesartan

type
1
receptor
blocker
(
ARB
)
that
has
been
to
shown
to
limit
ischemic
stroke
and
improve
stroke
outcome
.

In
experimental
stroke
,
candesartan
induces
a
proangiogenic
effect
that
is
partly
attributable
to
vascular
endothelial
growth
factor
.

Brain-derived
neurotrophic
factor
(
BDNF
)
is
a
member
of
the
neurotrophin
family
that
has
been
reported
to
have
angiogenic
effects
and
play
an
important
role
in
recovery
after
stroke
.

The
purpose
of
this
investigation
was
to
determine
the
role
of
BDNF
in
the
proangiogenic
effect
of
candesartan
in
the
brain
under
hypertensive
conditions
.

Accordingly
,
spontaneously
hypertensive
rats
were
treated
with
candesartan
,
and
brain
tissue
samples
were
collected
for
quantification
of
BDNF
expression
.

In
addition
,
human
cerebromicrovascular
endothelial
cells
were
treated
with
either
low-dose
(
1
ƒM
)
or
high-dose
(
1
µM
)
angiotensin
II
alone
or
in
combination
with
candesartan
(
0
.
16
µM
)
to
assess
the
effect
of
candesartan
treatment
and
BDNF
involvement
in
the
behavior
of
endothelial
cells
.

Candesartan
significantly
increased
the
expression
of
BDNF
in
the
SHR
(
P
<
0
.
05
)
.

In
addition
,
candesartan
reversed
the
antiangiogenic
effect
of
the
1-µM
dose
of
AngII
(
P
=
0
.
0001
)
.

The
observed
effects
of
candesartan
were
ablated
by
neutralizing
the
effects
of
BDNF
.

Treatment
with
the
AT2
antagonist
PD-123319
significantly
reduced
tube-like
formation
in
endothelial
cells
.

AT2
stimulation
induced
the
BDNF
expression
and
migration
(
P
<

)
.

In
conclusion
,
candesartan
exerts
a
proangiogenic
effect
on
brain
microvascular
endothelial
cells
treated
with
angiotensin
II
.

This
response
is
attributable
to
increased
BDNF
expression
and
is
mediated
through
stimulation
of
the
AT2
receptor
.

Posttranslational
modification
of
the
neural
cell
adhesion
molecule
(
NCAM
)
by
polysialic
acid
(
polySia
)
is
well
studied
in
the
nervous
system
and
described
as
a
dynamic
modulator
of
plastic
processes
like
precursor
cell
migration
,
axon

,
and

.

Here
,
we
describe
a
novel
function
of
polysialylated
NCAM
(
polySia-NCAM
)
in
innate
immunity
of
the
lung
.

In
mature
lung
tissue
of
healthy
donors
,
polySia
was
exclusively
attached
to
the
transmembrane
isoform
NCAM-140
and
located
to
intracellular
compartments
of
epithelial
cells
.

In
patients
with
chronic
obstructive
pulmonary
disease
,
however
,
increased
polySia
levels
and
processing
of
the
NCAM
carrier
were
observed
.

Processing
of
polysialylated
NCAM
was
reproduced
in
a
mouse
model
by
bleomycin
administration
leading
to
an
activation
of
the
inflammasome
and
secretion
of
interleukin
(
IL
)
-1β
.

As
shown
in
a
cell
culture
model
,
polySia-NCAM-140
was
kept
in
the
late
trans-Golgi
apparatus
of
lung
epithelial
cells
and
stimulation
by
IL-1β
or
lipopolysaccharide
induced
metalloprotease-mediated
ectodomain
shedding
,
resulting
in
the
secretion
of
soluble
polySia-NCAM
.

Interestingly
,
polySia
chains
of
secreted
NCAM
neutralized
the
cytotoxic
activity
of
extracellular
histones
as
well
as
DNA
/
histone-network-containing
"neutrophil
extracellular
traps"
,
which
are
formed
during
invasion
of
microorganisms
.

Thus
,
shedding
of
polySia-NCAM
by
lung
epithelial
cells
may
provide
a
host-protective
mechanism
to
reduce
tissue
damage

RATIONALE
:
Prepulse
inhibition
(
PPI
)
is
an
operational
measure
of
sensorimotor
gating
that
is
deficient
in
schizophrenia
patients
.

In
rats
,
PPI
deficits
induced
by
dopamine
(
DA
)
agonists
are
reversed
by
antipsychotics
.

Inhibition
of
the
striatum-rich
phosphodiesterase
(
PDE
)
10A
may
represent
a
novel
antipsychotic
mechanism
.

Previous
studies
were
controversial
,
showing
antipsychotic-like
profiles
in
measures
of
PPI
for
the
preferential
PDE10A
inhibitor
papaverine
(
PAP
)
but
not
the
novel
PDE10A
inhibitor
TP-10
.

OBJECTIVE
:
The
aim
of
the
study
was
to
evaluate
the
antipsychotic
profile
of
PAP
in
rats
using
PPI
.

MATERIALS
AND
METHODS
:
PPI
deficits
were
induced
in
rats
by
apomorphine
(
APO;
0
.

,
0

5
mg

was
tested
against
these
agonists
in
Sprague-Dawley
(
SD

or
Wistar
(
WI
)
rats
.

Prepulse
intervals
ranged
from
10
to
120
ms
.

Further
tests
evaluated
the
effects
of
PAP
on
spontaneous
locomotion
,
AMPH
(
1
mg
/
kg
)
-induced
hyperlocomotion
,
and
core
body
temperature
(
T
degrees
)
.

RESULTS
:
HAL
reversed
APO-induced
PPI
deficits
but
PAP
failed
to
reverse
APO-
and
AMPH-induced
PPI
deficits
at
all
doses
,
strains
,
pretreatment
times
,
and
prepulse
intervals
.

PAP
(
30
mg
/
kg
)
significantly
reduced
AMPH
hyperlocomotion
in
SD
rats
,
and
a
similar
pattern
was
detected
in
WI
rats
.

This
PAP
dose
also
strongly
reduced
spontaneous
locomotion
and
T
degrees
in
SD
rats
.

CONCLUSION
:
Our
study
does
not
support
an
antipsychotic-like
profile
of
PAP
in
dopaminergic
PPI
models
.

(

in

.

The
enhancement
of
Ca2
+
contraction
produced
by
norepinephrine
was
greater
than
that
produced
by
methoxamine
or
clonidine
.

In
beta-escin-skinned
strips
of
chloroethylclonidine-pretreated
smooth
muscle
,
the
enhancement
of
Ca2
+
contraction
produced
by
norepinephrine
was
significantly
decreased
,
whereas
the
amplitude
was
the
same
as
that
produced
by
methoxamine
or
clonidine;
this
enhancement
was
inhibited
by
the
selective
alpha
1A-adrenoceptor
antagonist
WB
4101
(
100
nM
)
.

The
enhancement
of
Ca2
+
contraction
produced
by
methoxamine
and
clonidine
was
not
affected
by
chloroethylclonidine
pretreatment
.

The
effects
of
methoxamine
,
clonidine
and
norepinephrine
in
the
chloroethylclonidine-pretreated
tissue
were
all
inhibited
by
guanosine
5'-O-
(

)
(

,

mM
)
and
1-
(

-methylpiperazine
(

,

microM
)
.

Furthermore
,
the
phosphorylation
of
myosin
light
chain
produced
by
norepinephrine
was
greater
than
that
produced
by
clonidine
.

These
results
suggest
that
both
alpha
1-adrenoceptor
subtypes
(
alpha
1A
and
alpha
1B
)
increase
the
Ca2
+
sensitivity
of
contractile
elements
,
and
that
the
Ca2
+
sensitization
produced
by
alpha
1A-subtype
receptors
is
mediated
through
G-protein
and
protein
kinase
C
,
and
plays
an
important
role
in
contraction
of
smooth
muscle
of
rabbit
thoracic
aorta
.
Although
agonist
binding
in
adrenergic
receptors
is
fairly
well
understood
and
involves
residues
located
in
transmembrane
domains
3
through
6
,
there
are
few
residues
reported
that
are
involved
in
antagonist
binding
.

In
fact
,
a
major
docking
site
for
antagonists
has
never
been
reported
in
any
G-protein
coupled
receptor
.

It
has
been
speculated
that
antagonist
binding
is
quite
diverse
depending
upon
the
chemical
structure
of
the
antagonist
,
which
can
be
quite
different
from
agonists
.

We
now
report
the
identification
of
two
phenylalanine
residues
in
transmembrane
domain
7
of
the
alpha
(
1a
)
-adrenergic
receptor
(
Phe-312
and
Phe-308
)
that
are
a
major
site
of
antagonist
affinity
.

Mutation
of
either
Phe-308
or
Phe-312
resulted
in
significant
losses
of
affinity
(
4-1200-fold
)
for
the
antagonists
prazosin
,
WB4101
,
BMY7378
,
(
+
)
niguldipine
,
and
5-methylurapidil
,
with
no
changes
in
affinity
for
phenethylamine-type
agonists
such
as
epinephrine
,
methoxamine
,
or
phenylephrine
.

Interestingly
,
both
residues
are
involved
in
the
binding
of
all
imidazoline-type
agonists
such
as
oxymetazoline
,
cirazoline
,
and
clonidine
,
confirming
previous
evidence
that
this
class
of
ligand
binds
differently
than
phenethylamine-type
agonists
and
may
be
more
antagonist-like
,
which
may
explain
their
partial
agonist
properties
.

In
modeling
these
interactions
with
previous
mutagenesis
studies
and
using
the
current
backbone
structure
of
rhodopsin
,
we
conclude
that
antagonist
binding
is
docked
higher
in
the
pocket
closer
to
the
extracellular
surface
than
agonist
binding
and
appears
skewed
toward
transmembrane
domain
7
.
BACKGROUND
:
(
+
/
-
)
-Modafinil
has
piqued
interest
as
a
treatment
for
attention-deficit
/
hyperactivity
disorder
and
stimulant
dependence
.

The
R-enantiomer
of
modafinil
might
have
unique
pharmacological
properties
that
should
be
further
investigated
.

METHODS
:
(
+
/
-
)
-Modafinil
and
its
R-
(
-
)
-
and
S-
(
+
)
-enantiomers
were
synthesized
and
tested
for
inhibition
of
[
(
3
)
H
]
dopamine
(
DA
)
uptake
and
[
(

)
H
]
WIN
35428
binding
in
human
dopamine
transporter
(
DAT
)
wild-type
and
mutants
with
altered
conformational
equilibria
.

Data
were
compared
with
cocaine
and
the
atypical
DA
uptake
inhibitor
,
JHW
007
.

R-
and
S-modafinil
were
also
evaluated
in
microdialysis
studies
in
the
mouse
nucleus
accumbens
shell
and
in
a
cocaine
discrimination
procedure
.

RESULTS
:
(
+
/
-
)
-
,
R-
,
and
S-modafinil
bind
to
the
DAT
and
inhibit
DA
uptake
less
potently
than
cocaine
,
with
R-modafinil
having
approximately
threefold
higher
affinity
than
its
S-enantiomer
.

Molecular
docking
studies
revealed
subtle
differences
in
binding
modes
for
the
enantiomers
.

R-modafinil
was
significantly
less
potent
in
the
DAT
Y156F
mutant
compared
with
wild-type
DAT
,
whereas
S-modafinil
was
affected
less
.

Studies
with
the
Y335A
DAT
mutant
showed
that
the
R-
and
S-enantiomers
tolerated
the
inward-facing
conformation
better
than
cocaine
,
which
was
further
supported
by
[
2-
(
trimethylammonium
)
ethyl
]
-methanethiosulfonate
reactivity
on
the
DAT
E2C
I159C
.

Microdialysis
studies
demonstrated
that
both
R-
and
S-modafinil
produced
increases
in
extracellular
DA
concentrations
in
the
nucleus
accumbens
shell
less
efficaciously
than
cocaine
and
with
a
longer
duration
of
action
.

Both
enantiomers
fully
substituted
in
mice
trained
to
discriminate
cocaine
from
saline
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
R-modafinil
displays
an
in
vitro
profile
different
from
cocaine
.

Future
trials
with
R-modafinil
as
a
substitute
therapy
with
the
potential
benefit
of
cognitive
enhancement
for
psychostimulant
addiction
are
warranted
.
Cinobufagin
,
a
major
component
of
cinobufacini
(
huachansu
)
,
is
an
important
cardenolidal
steroid
.

Several
studies
have
suggested
that
cinobufagin
has
potent
anti-cancer
effects
.

The
present
study
examines
the
apoptosis-inducing
activity
and
the
underlying
mechanism
of
action
of
cinobufagin
in
osteosarcoma
(
OS
)
cells
.

Our
results
showed
that
cinobufagin
potently
inhibited
the
proliferation
of
U2OS
,
MG63
and
SaOS-2
cells
.

Significant
increases
in
G2
/
M
cell-cycle
arrest
and
apoptosis
in
OS
cells
were
also
observed
.

The
expression
levels
of
several
apoptotic
proteins
were
assessed
after
cinobufagin
treatment
in
U2OS
cells
.

Among
them
,
xIAP
,
cIAP-1
,
survivin
and
Bcl-2
levels
decreased
remarkably
,
while
the
levels
of
Bax
and
cleaved-PARP
increased
.

Furthermore
,
we
validated
the
inhibition
of
GSK-3β
/
NF-κB
signaling
following
cinobufagin
treatment
.

Western
blots
showed
a
decrease
in
nuclear
p65
protein
expression
after
exposure
to
different
concentrations
of
cinobufagin
,
while
the
phosphorylation
of
GSK-3β
was
simultaneously
increased
.

Transduction
with
constitutively
active
forms
of
GSK-3β
could
protect
against
the
downregulation
of
p65
and
upregulation
of
cleaved-PARP
that
are
induced
by
cinobufagin
treatment
.

However
,
combined
treatment
with
cinobufagin
and
SB216367
resulted
in
a
significant
reduction
in
p65
and
an
increase
in
cleaved-PARP
in
U2OS
cells
.

Altogether
,
these
results
show
that
cinobufagin
is
a
promising
agent
for
the
treatment

BACKGROUND
AND
RATIONALE
:
We
previously
found
that
the
intronic
norepinephrine
transporter
gene
(
SLC6A2
)
polymorphism
rs36017
modulates
feelings
of
elation
after
administration
of
20
mg
D-amphetamine
in
healthy
volunteers
.

OBJECTIVES
:
In
this
study
,
we
further
investigated
the
association
between
D-amphetamine
response
and
11
SLC6A2
single-nucleotide
polymorphisms
(
SNPs
)
,
including
rs36017
,
in
an
extended
sample
of
Caucasian
young
adults
.

METHODS
:
One
hundred
fifty-nine
healthy
volunteers
participated
in
a
three-session
double-blind
crossover
design
receiving
either
placebo
or
oral
D-amphetamine
(
10
and
20
mg
)
.

Based
on
our
previous
results
,
we
examined
the
associations
between
levels
of
self-reported
elation
and
vigor
after
D-amphetamine
administration
and
SNPs
and
SNP
haplotypes
in
SLC6A2
.

RESULTS
:
Consistent
with
our
previous
findings
,
SNPs
rs36017
and
rs1861647
were
associated
with
significantly
higher
ratings
of
elation
and
vigor
after
20
mg
Damphetamine
.

Ratings
of
vigor
after
20
mg
D-amphetamine
were
also
associated
with
a
two-SNP
haplotype
formed
with
rs1861647
and
rs5569
and
a
three-SNP
haplotype
formed
with
rs36017
,
rs10521329
,
and
rs3785155
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
These
results
provide
further
evidence
that
genetic
variants
in
the
SLC6A2
gene
are
involved
in
acute
response
to
D-amphetamine
,
which
may
influence
progression
to
amphetamine
abuse
.

Identifying
sources
of
variation
in
acute
drug
responses
could
lead
to
better
prevention
and
treatment
of
psychostimulant
abuse
and
may
be
valuable
in
the
therapeutic
use
of
stimulants
.
Effects

on
the

)

(
ENaC
)
and
CFTR
:
implications
for
cystic
fibrosis
.
In
the
present
study
,
age-related
changes
of
pyridoxal
5'-phosphate
(
PLP
)
synthesizing
enzymes
,
pyridoxal
kinase
(
PLK
)
and
pyridoxine
5'-phosphate
oxidase
(
PNPO
)
,
their
protein
contents
and
activities
were
examined
in
the
gerbil
hippocampus
proper
.

Significant
age-dependent
changes
in
PLK
and
PNPO
immunoreactivities
were
found
in
the
CA1
region
,
but
not
in
the
CA2
/
3
region
.

In
the
postnatal
month
1
(
PM
1
)
group
,
PLK
and
PNPO
immunoreactivities
were
detected
mainly
in
the
stratum
pyramidale
of
the
CA1
region
.

PLK
and
PNPO
immunoreactivities
and
their
protein
contents
were
highest
in
the
PM
6
group
,
showing
that
many
CA1
pyramidal
cells
had
strong
PLK
and
PNPO
immunoreactivities
.

Thereafter
,
PLK
and
PNPO
immunoreactivities
started
to
decrease
and
were
very
low
at
PM
24
.

Alterations
in
the
change
patterns
in
protein
contents
and
total
activities
of
PLK
and
PNPO
corresponded
to
the
immunohistochemical
data
,
but
their
specific
activities
were
not
altered
in
any
experimental
group
.

Based
on
double
immunofluorescence
study
,
PLK
and
PNPO
immunoreactive
cells
in
the
strata
oriens
and
radiatum
were
identified
as
GABAergic
cells
.

Therefore
,
decreases
of
PLK
and
PNPO
in
the
hippocampal
CA1
region
of
aged
brains
may
be
involved
in
aging
processes
related
with
gamma-aminobutyric
acid
(
GABA
)
function
.

Cyclooxygenase
isozymes
(
COX-1
and
COX-2
)
are
found
to
be
constitutively
expressed
in
brain
,
with
neuronal
expression
of
COX-2
being
rapidly
induced
after
numerous
insults
,
including
cerebral
ischemia
.

Because
overactivation
of
N-methyl-D-aspartate
(
NMDA
)
receptors
has
been
implicated
in
the
cell
loss
associated
with
ischemia
,
we
characterized
the
expression
of
the
COX
isozymes
in
murine
mixed
cortical
cell
cultures
and
used
isozyme-selective
inhibitors
to
determine
their
relative
contribution
to
NMDA
receptor-stimulated
prostaglandin
(
PG
)
production
and
excitotoxic
neuronal
cell
death
.

Immunocytochemical
analysis
of
mixed
cortical
cell
cultures
revealed
that
COX-2
expression
was
restricted
to
neurons
,
whereas
COX-1
was
expressed
in
both
neurons
and
astrocytes
.

Brief
exposure
to
NMDA
(
5
min;
100
microM
)
elicited
a
time-dependent
accumulation
of
PGs
in
the
culture
medium
that
preceded
neuronal
cell
death
and
correlated
with
the
induction
of
COX-2
mRNA
.

COX-1
expression
remained
unchanged
.

Flurbiprofen
,
a
nonselective
COX-1
/
COX-2
inhibitor
,
blocked
NMDA-stimulated
PG
production
and
attenuated
neuronal
death
in
a
concentration-dependent
manner
.

Similar
results
were
obtained
with
the
specific
COX-2
inhibitor
NS-398
(
10-30
microM
)
but
not
with
the
selective
COX-1
inhibitor
valeryl
salicylate
(
10-300
microM
)
.

Inhibition
of
total
constitutive
COX
activity
with
aspirin
(
100
microM
,
1
.
5
h
)
before
NMDA
exposure
did
not
prevent
subsequent
NMDA-mediated
neuronal
cell
death
.

However
,
neuronal
injury
in
aspirin-pretreated
cultures
was
attenuated
by
flurbiprofen
administration
after
NMDA
exposure
.

Finally
,
the
protection
afforded
by
COX-2
inhibition
was
specific
for
NMDA
because
neither
flurbiprofen
nor
NS-398
protected
neurons
against
kainate-mediated
neurotoxicity
.

Together
,
these
results
support
the
conclusion
that
newly
synthesized
COX-2
protein
contributes
to
NMDA-induced
neuronal
injury
.
Excess
activation
of
glutamatergic
neurotransmission
in
the
cerebral
cortex
following
ethanol
withdrawal
is
considered
to
contribute
to
significant
behavioural
disturbances
,
and
to
alcohol
craving
.

Astrocytes
may
play
a
role
in
these
manifestations
because
astrocytes
are
essential
in
the
regulation
of
released
glutamate
and
its
conversion
to
glutamine
through
the
enzyme
glutamine
synthetase
(
GS
)
.

However
,
it
is
unclear
if
withdrawal
from
free-choice
ethanol
drinking
causes
changes
in
the
numbers
of
astrocytes
expressing
GS
or
the
cytoskeletal
protein
of
astrocytes
glial
fibrillary
acidic
protein
(
GFAP
)
.

Alcohol-preferring
(
P
)
rats
exposed
to
free-choice
ethanol
drinking
were
either
maintained
without
forced
interruption
of
ethanol
drinking
,
subjected
to
a
3-day
withdrawal
period
at
the
end
of
2
months
,
or
subjected
to
three
3-day
withdrawal
periods
along
6
months
.

At
2
months
,
P
rats
were
also
compared
with
alcohol-naive
alcohol
non-preferring
rats
(
NP
)
rats
.

Packing
density
of
GS
and
GFAP-immunoreactive
(
IR
)
astrocytes
was
measured
in
sections
from
the
prelimbic
cortex
(
PLC
)
using
the
optical
disector
probe
.

An
alcohol
deprivation
effect
was
observed
in
P
rats
with
withdrawals
during
a
6-month
ethanol
drinking
period
.

Ethanol
withdrawal
significantly
increased
the
packing
density
of
GS-
and
GFAP-IR
astrocytes
in
the
PLC
of
P
rats
as
compared
with
P
rats
with
continuous
access
to
ethanol
.

In
addition
,
there
was
a
positive
correlation
between
the
pre-withdrawal
ethanol
consumption
and
the
packing
density
of
GS-IR
astrocytes
.

The
present
results
suggest
the
involvement
of
astrocytes
in
the
regulation
of
the
glutamatergic
activation
associated
with
withdrawal
from
free-choice
ethanol
consumption
and
point
to
differential
adaptations
of
GS
and
GFAP
to
prolonged
alcohol
drinking
in
the
PLC
of
P
rats
.

Botulinum
toxin
type
A
(
BoNT
/
A
)
produced
by
Clostridium
botulinum
inhibits
Ca2
+
-dependent
acetylcholine
(
ACh
)
release
(
neuroexocytosis
)
at
peripheral
neuromuscular
junctions
,
sometimes
causing
neuromuscular
paralysis
.

This
inhibitory
effect
is
attributed
to
its
metalloprotease
activity
to
cleave
the
25-kDa
synaptosomal-associated
protein
,
which
is
essential
for
the
exocytotic
machinery
.

However
,
deletion
of
this
protein
does
not
result
in
a
complete
block
of
neuroexocytosis
,
suggesting
that
botulinum-mediated
inhibition
may
occur
via
another
mechanism
.

Rho
GTPases
,
a
class
of
small
GTP-binding
proteins
(
G
proteins
)
,
control
actin
cytoskeletal
organization
,
thereby
regulating
a
variety
of
cellular
functions
in
various
cells
,
including
neuronal
cells
.

We
have
shown
that
the
G
protein
activator
lysophosphatidic
acid
(
LPA
)
triggered
actin
reorganization
followed
by
Ca2
+
-dependent
ACh
release
in
nerve
growth
factor-treated
PC12
cells
and
that
BoNT
/
A
blocked
both
events
through
degradation
of
RhoB
by
the
proteasome
.

Overexpression
of
wild-type
RhoB
caused
actin
reorganization
and
enhanced
the
release
of
ACh
by
LPA
to
overcome
toxin's
inhibitory
effect
on
actin
reorganization
/
exocytosis
stimulated
by
LPA
,
whereas
overexpression
of
a
dominant
negative
RhoB
inhibited
ACh
release
,
regardless
of
LPA
and
/
or
toxin
treatment
.

Finally
,
a
knockdown
of
the
RhoB
gene
via
sequence-specific
,
post-transcriptional
gene
silencing
reduced
RhoB
expression
in
PC12
cells
,
resulting
in
total
inhibition
of
both
actin
reorganization
and
ACh
release
induced
by
LPA
.

We
conclude
that
the
RhoB
signaling
pathway
regulates
ACh
release
via
actin
cytoskeletal
reorganization
and
that
botulinum
toxin
inhibits
neuroexocytosis
by
targeting
RhoB
pathway
.

Olopatadine
hydrochloride
(

)
is
an
antiallergic
drug
with

(

Recently
,
olopatadine
has
been
shown
to
bind
to
S100A12
which
is
a
member
of
the
S100
family
of
calcium-binding
proteins
,
and
exerts
multiple
proinflammatory
activities
including
chemotaxis
for
monocytes
and
neutrophils
.

In
this
study
,
we
examined
the
possibility
that
the
interaction
of
olopatadine
with
S100A12
inhibits
the
proinflammatory
effects
of
S100A12
.

did

Amlexanox
,
which
also
binds

,
inhibited
the
THP-1
migration
induced
by
S100A12
.

However
,
ketotifen

another
histamine
H
(
1
)

,
had
little
effect
on
the
activity
of
S100A12

These
results
suggest
that
olopatadine
has
a
new
mechanism

action
,
that
is

the

Cocaine
modulates
serum
levels
of
progesterone
in
intact
female
and
male
rats
,
as
well
as
in
pregnant
dams
,
and
progesterone
decreases
or
attenuates
cocaine-induced
behavioral
and
reward
responses
.

It
has
been
postulated
that
cocaine's
modulation
of
serum
progesterone
levels
may
in
turn
alter
progesterone
receptor
activity
,
thereby
contributing
to
cocaine-induced
alterations
of
neuronal
functions
and
genomic
regulations
.

To
test
this
hypothesis
,
intact
male
rats
received
acute
injections
of
saline
or
cocaine
(
15
or
30
mg

,
respectively
.

After
injection
of
15
mg

of
cocaine
,
induction
of
progesterone
serum
levels
was
closely
followed
by
an
increase
in
receptor
protein
levels
and
DNA

complexes
.

After
injection
of
30
mg

of
cocaine
,
similar
effects
were
observed
along
with
an
attenuation
of
receptor
protein
levels
and
DNA
binding
complexes
at
60
min
.

Our
results
suggest
that
activation
of
progesterone
receptors
may
be
a
mechanism
by
which
cocaine
mediates
behavior
through
molecular
alterations
in
the

From

Adenylosuccinate
synthetase
(
AdSS
)
catalyses
the
Mg
(
2
+
)
dependent
formation
of
adenylosuccinate
from
IMP
and
aspartate
,
the
reaction
being
driven
by
the
hydrolysis
of
GTP
to
GDP
.

All
characterized
AdSS
thus
far
exhibit
a
random
kinetic
mechanism
.

We
present
here
kinetic
evidence
that
unlike
all
other
AdSS
,
Plasmodium
falciparum
AdSS
(
PfAdSS
)
has
ordered
substrate
binding
.

Inhibition
studies
show
that
binding
of
GTP
requires
IMP
binding
while
aspartate
binds
to
the
enzyme-IMP-GTP
complex
.

A
structural
basis
for
this
difference
in
mechanism
is
presented
.

Kinetically
,
PfAdSS
is
closer
to
the
mouse
acidic
isozyme
rather
than
to
the
mouse
basic
isozyme
.

The
mouse
acidic
isozyme
is
thought
to
play
a
role
in
the
purine
nucleotide
biosynthetic
pathway
.

Regulation
of
PfAdSS
in
vivo
can
therefore
,
be
expected
to
be
similar
to
the
mouse
acidic
isozyme
,
in
agreement
with
the
role
of
PfAdSS
as
the
only
pathway
for
the
synthesis
of
adenine
nucleotides
in
the
parasite
.

However
,
PfAdSS
differs
from
both
the
mammalian
homologs
in
that
fructose-1
,
6-bisphosphate
,
a
potent
inhibitor
of
the
mammalian
enzyme
,
is
an
activator
of
PfAdSS
.

The
differences
highlighted
here
are
promising
in
terms
of
species-specific
drug
design
,
targeting
this
essential
enzyme
in
the
parasite
.

Progesterone

plays
a
key
role
in

compounds
that

have
potential
use
in
the
treatment
of
estrogen-
and
progesterone-dependent
diseases
,
including
uterine
leiomyomas
and
breast
cancer
.

In
the
present
study
,
we
chemically
synthesized
novel
17-fluorinated
steroids
and
evaluated
the
cytotoxicity
profiles
of
these
compounds
in

,

,

,

and

.

We
analyzed
in
vitro
receptor-binding
assays
and
PR-transactivation
assays
to
establish
the
antiprogestational
activity
of
these
molecules
.

The
representative
antiprogestin

was
found
to
inhibit
in

in
a
dose-dependent
fashion
in
T47D
cells
by
a
colony
formation
assay
at
1

concentrations

The
potent
in

antiprogestational
activity
of
EC304
was
also
demonstrated
in
an
antinidation
assay

.

The
strong
antiprogestational
activity
and
absence
of
antiglucocorticoid

in

may
demonstrate
their
utility
in
the

Cocaine-

(

)
is
widely
expressed
in
the
rat
central
nervous
system
,
notably
in
areas
involved
in
control
of
autonomic
and
neuroendocrine
functions
.

The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
evaluate
the
effects
of
CART
peptide
fragment
55-102
,
referred
to
herein
as
CARTp
,
by
intrathecal
injection
on
blood
pressure
(
BP
)
and
heart
rate
(
HR
)
before
and
after
intrathecal
glutamate
in
urethane-anesthetized
male
Sprague-Dawley
rats
.

CARTp
(
0
.
1-10
nmol
)
administered
intrathecally
caused
no
or
a
small
,
statistically
insignificant
increase
of
blood
pressure
and
heart
rate
,
except
at
the
concentration
of
10
nmol
,
which
caused
a
significant
increase
of
blood
pressure
and
heart
rate
.

Intrathecal
glutamate
(
0
.
1-10
nmol
)
produced
a
dose-dependent
increase
in
arterial
pressure
and
heart
rate
.

Pretreatment
with
CARTp
dose-dependently
potentiated
the
pressor
effects
of
glutamate
(
1
nmol
)
,
which
by
itself
elicited
a
moderate
increase
of
blood
pressure
and
heart
rate
.

Further
,
CARTp
significantly
potentiated
the
tachycardic
effect
of
glutamate
at
1
and
5
nmol
,
but
attenuated
the
response
at
10
nmol
.

The
effect
of
CARTp
was
long-lasting
,
as
it
enhanced
glutamatergic
responses
up
to
90
min
after
administration
.

Prior
injection
of
CARTp
antiserum
(
1
:
500
)
but
not
normal
rabbit
serum
nullified
the
potentiating
effect
of
CARTp
on
glutamatergic
responses
.

The
result
suggests
that
CARTp
,
whose
immunoreactivity
is
detectable
in
sympathetic
preganglionic
neurons
as
well
as
in
fibers
projecting
into
the
intermediolateral
cell
column
,
augments
spinal
sympathetic
outflow
elicited
by
glutamate
at
lower
concentrations
and
may
directly
excite
neurons
in
the
intermediolateral
cell
column
at
higher
concentrations
.
3-Methylcholanthrene
(
MC
)
is
a

MC
disrupts

of
mouse
hepatic
growth

)

components
and
suppresses
cytochrome

a
male-specific
gene
controlled
by
pulsatile
GH
via
signal
transducer
and
activator
of
transcription
5b
(
STAT5b
)
.

To
determine
if
these
effects
of
MC
depend
on
hepatic
microsomal
P450-mediated
activity
,
we
examined
biologic
responses
to
MC
treatment
in
liver
Cpr-null
(
LCN
)
mice
with
hepatocyte-specific
conditional
deletion
of
NADPH-cytochrome

(
POR
)
.

MC
caused
mild
induction
of
Por
and
a
hepatic
inflammatory
marker
in
wild-type
mice
,
whereas
MC
caused
strong
induction
of
AHR
target
genes
,
Cyp1a1
,
Cyp1a2
,
and
Cyp1b1
in
wild-type
and

mice
.

Two
mouse
hepatic
STAT5b

genes
,
Cyp2d9
and
major
urinary

(
Mup2
)
,
were
suppressed
by
MC
in
wild-type
mice
,
and
the
CYP2D9
mRNA
response
was
maintained
in
LCN
mice
.

In
wild-type
mice
only
,
MC
decreased
hepatic
GH
receptor
(
GHR
)
mRNA
but
increased
GHR
protein
levels
.

There
was
an
apparent
impairment
of
STAT5
phosphorylation
by
MC
in
wild-type
and
LCN
mice
,
but
large
interanimal
variation
prevented
achievement
of
statistical
significance
.

In

mice
,
basal

and
the

of

influenced

status
.

These
results
indicate
that
the
effects
of
MC
on
hepatic
GH
signaling
components
and

genes
are
complex
,
involving
aspects
that
are

Krüppel-like
Factor

(
KLF3
)
is
a
transcriptional
regulator
that
we
have
shown
to
be
involved
in
the
regulation
of
adipogenesis
in
vitro
.

Here
we
report
that
KLF3
null
mice
are
lean
and
protected
from
diet-induced
obesity
and
glucose
intolerance
.

On
a
chow
diet
,
plasma
levels
of
leptin
are
decreased
,
and
adiponectin
is
increased
.

Despite
significant
reductions
in
body
weight
and
adiposity
,
wildtype
and
knockout
animals
show
equivalent
energy
intake
,
expenditure
and
excretion
.

To
investigate
the
molecular
events
underlying
these
observations
,
we
used
microarray
analysis
to
compare
gene
expression
in
Klf3
(
+
/
+
)
and
Klf3
(
-
/

)
tissues
.

We
found
that
mRNA
expression
of
Fam132a
,
which
encodes
a
newly
identified
insulin-sensitizing
adipokine
,
adipolin
,
is
significantly
upregulated
in
the
absence
of
KLF3
.

We
confirmed
that
KLF3
binds
the
Fam132a
promoter
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
and
that
this
leads
to
repression
of
promoter
activity
.

Further
,
plasma
adipolin
levels
were
significantly
increased
in
Klf3
(
-

)
mice
compared
to
wild-type
littermates
.

Boosting
levels
of
adipolin
via
targeting
of
KLF3
offers
a
novel
potential
therapeutic
strategy
for
the

At

cholinergic
deficit
associated
with
this
disease
.

However
,
none
of
the
approved
drugs
is
ideal
in
efficacy
or
tolerability
.

One
possible
strategy
to
improve
selectivity
and
potency
is
to
design
drugs
that
can
simultaneously
bind
to
the
catalytic

peripheral
anionic
sites

In
this
review

will
describe
the
development
of

from
the
early
observations

Eosinophilic
oesophagitis
:
a
common
cause
of
dysphagia
in
young
The
anticonvulsant
activity
of
inhibitors
of
monoamine
oxidase
(
MAO
)
was
reported
early
after
the
development
of
irreversible
MAO
inhibitors
such
as
tranylcypromine
,
but
was
never
clinically
used
because
of
the
adverse
effects
of
these
compounds
.

The
more
recently
developed
reversible
MAO
inhibitors
with
selectivity
for
either
the
MAO-A
or
MAO-B
isoenzyme
forms
have
not
been
studied
extensively
in
animal
models
of
epilepsy
,
so
it
is
not
known
which
type
of
MAO
inhibitor
is
particularly
effective
in
this
respect
.

We
compared
the
following
drugs
in
the
kindling
model
of
epilepsy
:
1
)
L-deprenyl
(
selegiline
)
,
i
.

e

,
an
irreversible
inhibitor
of
MAO-B
,
which
,
however
,
also
inhibits
MAO-A
at
higher
doses
,
2
)
the
novel
reversible
MAO-B
inhibitor
LU
53439
(
3
,
4-dimethyl-7-
(
2-isopropyl-1
,
3
,
4-thiadiazol-5-yl
)
-methoxy-coumarin
)
,
which
is
much
more
selective
for
MAO-B
than
L-deprenyl
,
3
)
the
novel
reversible
and
highly
selective
MAO-A
inhibitor
LU
43839
(
esuprone;
7-hydroxy-3
,
4-dimethylcoumarin
ethanesulfonate
)
,
and
4
)
the
irreversible
nonselective
MAO
inhibitor
tranylcypromine
.

Esuprone
proved
to
be
an
effective
anticonvulsant
in
the
kindling
model
with
a
similar
potency
as
L-deprenyl
.

In
contrast
to
esuprone
and
L-deprenyl
,
the
selective
MAO-B
inhibitor
LU
53439
was
not
effective
in
the
kindling
model;
this
substantiates
the
previous
notion
that
the
anticonvulsant
activity
of
L-deprenyl
is
not
related
to
MAO-B
inhibition
,
but
to
other
effects
of
this
drug
,
such
as
inhibition
of
MAO-A
.

Drugs
inhibiting
both
MAO-A
and
MAO-B
to
a
similar
extent
(
tranylcypromine
)
or
combinations
of
selective
MAO-A
and
MAO-B
inhibitors
(
esuprone
plus
LU
53439
)
had
no
advantage
over
MAO-A
inhibition
alone
,
but
were
less
well
tolerated
.

The
data
thus
suggest
that
selective
MAO-A
inhibitors
such
as
esuprone
may
be
an
interesting
new
approach
for
the
treatment
of
epilepsy
.

/

)
systems
was
studied
to
analyse
the
ability
of
lipid-derived
reactive
carbonyls
to
promote
PhIP
formation
.

Although
PhIP
was
produced
to
some
extent
in
the
CRN
/
Phe
system
,
the
presence
of
the
oxidized
lipid
increased
considerably
the
amount
of
PhIP
produced
.

This
increase
seemed
to
be
a
consequence
of
the
decrease
in
the
E
(
a
)
of
the
reaction
when
the
lipid
was
present
,
which
diminished
from

9

On
the
other
hand
,
the
addition
of
the
lipid
did
not
seem
to
produce
PhIP
by
an
alternative
mechanism
because
PhIP
was
formed
analogously
in
both
CRN
/
Phe
and
CRN
/
Phe
/
ON
systems
as
a
function
of
pH
,
creatinine
concentration
,
phenylalanine
concentration
,
time
,
temperature
,
oxygen
concentration
in
the
reaction
atmosphere
,
and
the
addition
of
different
amounts
of
ammonia
.

All
these
results
suggest
that
the
ability
of
lipid
oxidation
products
to
produce
PhIP
is
related
to
their
capacity
to
induce
the
Strecker
degradation
of
phenylalanine
to
phenylacetaldehyde
.

Therefore
,
any
other
reactive
carbonyl
compound
that
can
produce
the
Strecker
degradation
of
phenylalanine
should
also
be
considered
as
a
potential
inducer
of
PhIP

appropriate
conditions

being
driven
by
the

All
characterized
AdSS
thus
far
exhibit
a
random
kinetic
mechanism
.

We
present

kinetic
evidence
that
unlike
all
other
AdSS
,
Plasmodium

AdSS
(

Inhibition
studies
show
that
binding
of
GTP
requires
IMP
binding
while
aspartate
binds
to
the
enzyme-IMP-GTP
complex
.

A
structural
basis
for
this
difference
in
mechanism
is
presented
.

Kinetically
,
PfAdSS
is
closer
to
the
mouse
acidic

rather
than
to
the

thought
to
play
a
role
in
the
purine
nucleotide
biosynthetic
pathway
.

Regulation
of
PfAdSS
in
vivo
can
therefore
,
be
expected
to
be
similar
to
the
mouse
acidic
isozyme
,
in
agreement
with
the
role
of
PfAdSS
as
the
only
pathway
for
the
synthesis
of
adenine
nucleotides
in
the
parasite
.

However
,
PfAdSS
differs
from
both
the
mammalian
homologs
in
that
fructose-1
,
6-bisphosphate
,
a
potent
inhibitor
of
the
mammalian
enzyme
,
is
an
activator
of
PfAdSS
.

The
differences
highlighted
here
are
promising
in
terms
of
species-specific
drug
design
,
targeting
this
essential
enzyme
in
the
parasite

(

of

known
to
affect
a
cardiac
K
(
+
)
channel
encoded
by

ether-a-go-go-related
gene
(
HERG
)
.

In
this
paper
,
we
will
report
a
case
of
drug-induced
long
QT
syndrome
associated
with
an
H
(
1
)
-receptor
antagonist
,
hydroxyzine
,
in
which
a
mutation
was
identified
in
the
HERG
gene
.

After
taking
75
mg
of
hydroxyzine
for
several
days
,
a
34-year-old
female
began
to
experience
repetitive
syncope
.

The
deleterious
effect
of
hydroxyzine
was
suspected
because
QTc
interval
shortened
from
630
to
464
ms
after
cessation
of
the
drug
.

Later
on
,
the
patient
was
found
to
harbor
an
A614V-HERG
mutation
.

By
using
the
patch-clamp
technique
in
the
heterologous
expression
system
,
we
examined
the
functional
outcome
of
the
A614V
mutation
and
confirmed
a
dominant-negative
effect
on
HERG
expression
.

Hydroxyzine
concentration-dependently
inhibited
both
wild-type
(
WT
)
and
WT
/
A614V-HERG
K
(
+
)
currents
.

Half-maximum
block
concentrations
of
WT
and
WT

K
(
+
)
currents
were
0
.
62
and
0
.
52
microM
,
respectively
.

Thus
,
accidental
combination
of
genetic
mutation
and
intake
of
hydroxyzine
appeared
to
have
led
to
a
severe
phenotype
,
probably
,

Polybrominated
diphenyl
ethers
(
PBDEs
)
were
widely
used
flame
retardants
that
have
become
persistent
environmental
pollutants
.

In
the
present
study
,
we
investigated
the
in
vitro
oxidative
metabolism
of
2
,
2'
,
4
,
4'-tetrabromodiphenyl
ether
(
BDE-47
)
,
a
major
PBDE
detected
in
human
tissue
and
environmental
samples
.

Biotransformation
of
BDE-47
by
pooled
and
individual
human
liver
microsomes
and
by
human
recombinant
cytochrome
P450
(
P450
)
enzymes
was
assessed
using
a
liquid
chromatography
/
tandem
mass
spectrometry-based
method
.

Of
the
nine
hydroxylated
metabolites
of
BDE-47
produced
by
human
liver
microsomes
,
seven
metabolites
were
identified
using
authentic
standards
.

A
monohydroxy-tetrabrominated
and
a
dihydroxy-tetrabrominated
metabolite
remain
unidentified
.

Kinetic
analysis
of
the
rates
of
metabolite
formation
revealed
that
the
major
metabolites
were
5-hydroxy-2
,
2'
,
4
,
4'-tetrabromodiphenyl
ether
(
5-OH-BDE-47
)
,
6-hydroxy-2
,
2'
,
4
,
4'-tetrabromodiphenyl
ether
(
6-OH-BDE-47
)
,
and
possibly
the
unidentified
monohydroxy-tetrabrominated
metabolite
.

Among
the
human
recombinant
P450
enzymes
tested
,
P450
2B6
was
the
most
active
enzyme
in
the
formation
of
the
hydroxylated
metabolites
of
BDE-47
.

Moreover
,
the
formation
of
all
metabolites
of
BDE-47
by
pooled
human
liver
microsomes
was
inhibited
by
a
P450
2B6-specific
antibody
and
was
highly
correlated
with
P450
2B6-mediated
activity
in
single
donor
liver
microsomes
indicating
that
P450
2B6
was
the
major
P450
responsible
for
the
biotransformation
of
BDE-47
.

Additional
experiments
involving
the
incubation
of
liver
microsomes
with
individual
monohydroxy-tetrabrominated
metabolites
in
place
of
BDE-47
demonstrated
that
2
,
4-dibromophenol
was
a
product
of
BDE-47
and
several
primary
metabolites
,
but
the
dihydroxy-tetrabrominated
metabolite
was
not
formed
by
sequential
hydroxylation
of
any
of
the
monohydroxy-tetrabrominated
metabolites
tested
.

The
present
study
provides
a
comprehensive
characterization
of
the

of

The
functions
of
microRNAs
(
miRNAs
)
as
either
oncogenes
or
tumor
suppressors
in
regulating
cancer-related
events
have
been
established
.

We
analyzed
the
alterations
in
the
miRNA
expression
profile
of
the
glioma
cell
line
U-251
caused
by
ionizing
radiation
(
IR
)
by
using
an
miRNA
array
and
identified
several
miRNAs
whose
expression
was
significantly
affected
by
IR
.

Among
the
IR-responsive
miRNAs
,
we
further
examined
the
function
of
miR-193a-3p
,
which
exhibited
the
most
significant
growth-inhibiting
effect
.

miR-193a-3p
was
observed
to
induce
apoptosis
in
both
U-251
and
HeLa
cells
.

We
also
demonstrated
that
miR-193a-3p
induces
the
accumulation
of
intracellular
reactive
oxygen
species
(
ROS
)
and
DNA
damage
as
determined
by
the
level
of
γH2AX
and
by
performing
the
comet
assay
.

The
induction
of
both
apoptosis
and
DNA
damage
by
miR-193a-3p
was
blocked
by
antioxidant
treatment
,
indicating
the
crucial
role
of
ROS
in
the
action
of
miR-193a-3p
.

Among
the
putative
target
proteins
,
the
expression
of
Mcl-1
,
an
anti-apoptotic
Bcl-2
family
member
,
decreased
because
of
miR-193a-3p
transfection
.

A
reporter
assay
using
a
luciferase
construct
containing
the
3'-untranslated
region
of
Mcl-1
confirmed
that
Mcl-1
is
a
direct
target
of
miR-193a-3p
.

Down-regulation
of
Mcl-1
by
siRNA
transfection
closely
mimicked
the
outcome
of
miR-193a-3p
transfection
showing
increased
ROS
,
DNA
damage
,
cytochrome
c
release
,
and
apoptosis
.

Ectopic
expression
of
Mcl-1
suppressed
the
pro-apoptotic
action
of
miR-193a-3p
,
suggesting
that
Mcl-1
depletion
is
critical
for
miR-193a-3p
induced
apoptosis
.

Collectively
,
our
results
suggest
a
novel
function
for
miR-193a-3p
and
its
potential
application
in
cancer
therapy
.

(

,
none
of
the
other
factor

peptides
tested
or
a
control
peptide
with
the
inter-EGF
sequence
in

was
effective
.

A
recombinant

backbone
inhibited
binding
of

transfectants
in
a
dose-dependent
fashion
,
while
recombinant

had
no
effect
.

An
antibody
generated
against
the
factor
X
peptide
83-88
,
and
designated
JC15
,
inhibited
125I-factor

binding
to
HUVEC
.

The
JC15
antibody
bound
to
factor
Xa
and
the
recombinant
IX
/
X83-88
chimera
in
a
concentration
dependent
manner
,
while
no
specific
reactivity
with
factors
X
or
IXa
was
observed
.

Furthermore
,
binding
of
125I-factor
Xa
to
immobilized
JC15
was
inhibited
by
molar
excess
of
unlabeled
factor
Xa
,
but
not
by
comparable
concentrations
of
factors
X

.

These
findings
identify
the
inter-EGF
sequence
Leu83-Leu88
in
factor

as
a
novel
recognition
site
for
EPR-1
,
and
suggest
its

NLRP3

has
been
reported

immunological
diseases
including
colitis
.

However
,
there
are
few
drug
candidates
targeting
inflammasomes
for
the
treatment
of
colitis
.

In
the
present

,
we
aimed
at
examining
the
effect

Treatment
with

.

In
addition
,
the

were
also
significantly
reduced
by
Fc11a-2

.

Moreover
,

in

,
including
TNF-α
,
IL-1β
,
IL-18

,
were
markedly

.

Furthermore
,
a
decreased

)
macrophage
infiltration
in
colons
and
inactivation
of
caspase-1
in
peritoneal
macrophages
were
detected
in
Fc11a-2-treated
mice
.

The
mechanism
of
action
of
Fc11a-2
was
related
to
the
inhibition
of
the
cleavage
of
pro-caspase-1
,
pro-IL-1β
and
pro-IL-18
which
in
turn
suppressed
the
activation
of

.

Taken
together
,
our
results
demonstrate
the
ability
of
Fc11a-2
to
inhibit

Abstract
Context
:
Near-Infrared
(
NIR
)
spectroscopy
is
an
important
component
of
a
Process
Analytical
Technology
(
PAT
)
toolbox
and
is
a
key
technology
for
enabling
the
rapid
analysis
of
pharmaceutical
tablets
.

Objective
:
The
aim
of
this
research
work
was
to
develop
and
validate
NIR-chemometric
methods
not
only
for
the
determination
of
active
pharmaceutical
ingredients
content
but
also
pharmaceutical
properties
(
crushing
strength
,
disintegration
time
)
of
meloxicam
tablets
.

Materials
and
methods
:
The
development
of
the
method
for
active
content
assay
was
performed
on
samples
corresponding
to
80%
,
90%
,
100%
,
110%
and
120%
of
meloxicam
content
and
the
development
of
the
methods
for
pharmaceutical
characterization
was
performed
on
samples
prepared
at
seven
different
compression
forces
(
ranging
from
7
to
45
kN
)
using
NIR
transmission
spectra
of
intact
tablets
and
PLS
as
a
regression
method
.

Results
:
The
results
show
that
the
developed
methods
have
good
trueness
,
precision
and
accuracy
and
are
appropriate
for
direct
active
content
assay
in
tablets
(
ranging
from
12
to
18
mg
/
tablet
)
and
also
for
predicting
crushing
strength
and
disintegration
time
of
intact
meloxicam
tablets
.

Discussion
:
The
comparative
data
show
that
the
proposed
methods
are
in
good
agreement
with
the
reference
methods
currently
used
for
the
characterization
of
meloxicam
tablets
(
HPLC-UV
methods
for
the
assay
and
European
Pharmacopeia
methods
for
determining
the
crushing
strength
and
disintegration
time
)
.

Conclusion
:
The
results
show
the
possibility
to
predict
both
chemical
properties
(
active
content
)
and
physical
/
pharmaceutical
properties
(
crushing
strength
and
disintegration
time
)
directly
,
without
any
sample
preparation
,
from
the
same
NIR

The
aryl
hydrocarbon
receptor
is
a
member
of
the
basic-helix-loop-helix
family
of
transcription
factors
.

AhR
mediates
the
biochemical
and
toxic
effects
of
a
number
of
polyaromatic
hydrocarbons
such
as
2
,
3
,
7
,
8
,
-tetrachloro-dibenzo-p-dioxin
(
TCDD
)
.

AhR
is
widely
known
for
regulating
the
transcription
of
drug
metabolizing
enzymes
involved
in
the
xenobiotic
metabolism
of
carcinogens
and
therapeutic
agents
,
such
as
cytochrome
P450-1B1
(
CYP1B1
)
.

Additionally
,
AhR
has
also
been
reported
to
interact
with
multiple
signaling
pathways
during
prostate
development
.

Here
we
investigate
the
effect
of
sustained
AhR
signaling
on
androgen
receptor
function
in
prostate
cancer
cells
.

Immunoblot
analysis
shows
that
AhR
expression
is
increased
in
androgen
independent
(
C4-2
)
prostate
cancer
cells
when
compared
to
androgen
sensitive
(
LNCaP
)
cells
.

RT-PCR
studies
revealed
constitutive
AhR
signaling
in
C4-2
cells
without
the
ligand
induced
activation
required
in
LNCaP
cells
.

A
reduction
of
AhR
activity
by
short
RNA
mediated
silencing
in
C4-2
cells
reduced
expression
of
both
AhR
and
androgen
responsive
genes
.

The
decrease
in
androgen
responsive
genes
correlates
to
a
decrease
in
phosphorylated
androgen
receptor
and
androgen
receptor
expression
in
the
nucleus
.

Furthermore
,
the
forced
decrease
in
AhR
expression
resulted
in
a
50%
decline
in
the
growth
rate
of
C4-2
cells
.

These
data
indicates
that
AhR
is
required
to
maintain
hormone
independent
signaling
and
growth
by
the
androgen
receptor
in
C4-2
cells
.

Collectively
,
these
data
provide
evidence
of
a
direct
role
for
AhR
in
androgen
independent
signaling
and
provides
insight
into
the
molecular
mechanisms
responsible
for
sustained
androgen
receptor
signaling
in
hormone
refractory
prostate
cancer

certain
tissues
as
well
as
of
a
possible
relation
between
the
level
of
PDE3A
and
PDE5A
gene
expression
and
erectile
dysfunction
should
have
been
deduced
from
the
results
obtained
.

METHODS
:
Total
ribonucleic
acid
was
isolated
from
different
human
tissues
(
urogenital
tract
,
gastrointestinal
tract
,
cardiovascular
system
and
central
nervous
system
)
and
subjected
to
RTPCR
analysis
and
Northern
blotting
using
primers
and
probes
specific
for
PDE3A
and
PDE5A
.

RESULTS
:
As
shown
by
RT-PCR
and
Northern
blotting
,
PDE3A
and
PDE5A
mRNAs
exhibit
a
distinct
distribution
throughout
the
tissues
examined
but
were
2-fold
higher
in
cavernous
tissue
than
in
all
other
tissues
investigated
.

However
,
there
were
no
significant
differences
in
the
levels
of
gene
expression
between
the
two
subgroups
of
patients
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
Very
high
expression
levels
of
PDE3A
and
PDE5A
in
human
cavernous
tissue
underscore
the
physiological
importance
of
these
enzymes
for
the
regulation
of
penile
erection
,
emphasizing
their
therapeutical
and
pharmacological
relevance
.

The
distribution
pattern
of
the
mRNA
for
the
isoenzymes
PDE3A
and
PDE5A
may
explain
the
pharmacological
effects
as
well
as
the
side
effects
of
milrinone
and
sidenafil
.
Alpha

HDN
)
is
a

induced
when
a

2u-globulin
.

The
objective
of
this
study
was
to
investigate
if
the
newer
and
more
sensitive
renal
biomarkers
would
be
altered
with
HDN
as
well
as
be
able
to
distinguish
between
HDN
and
oxidative
stress-induced
kidney
injury
.

Rats
were
dosed
orally
for
7
days
to
determine
(
1
)
if
HDN
(
induced
by
2-propanol
or
D-limonene
)
altered
the
newer
renal
biomarkers
and
not
BUN
or
creatinine
,
(

)
if
renal
biomarkers
could
distinguish
between
HDN
and
oxidative

kidney
injury
(
induced
by
potassium
bromate
)
,
(

)
sensitivity
of
HDN-induced
renal
biomarker
changes
relative
to
D-limonene
dose
,
and

)
reversibility
of

renal
biomarkers
,
using

/

D-limonene
with
7
days
of
dosing
and
necropsies
scheduled
over
the
period
of
Days
8-85
.

HDN-induced
renal
biomarker
changes
in
male
rats
were
potentially
compound
specific
:
(
1
)
2-propanol
induced
mild
HDN
without
increased
renal
biomarkers
,
(
2
)
potassium
bromate
induced
moderate
HDN
with
increased
clusterin
,
and
(
3
)
D-limonene
induced
marked
HDN
with
increased
αGST
,
μGST
and
albumin
.

Administration
of
potassium
bromate
did
not
result
in
oxidative
stress-induced
kidney
injury
,
based
on
histopathology
and
renal
biomarkers
creatinine
and
BUN
.

The
compound
D-limonene
induced
a
dose
dependent
increase
in
HDN
severity
and
renal
biomarker
changes
without
altering
BUN
,
creatinine
or
NAG
:
(

)
minimal
induction
of
HDN
and
no
altered
biomarkers
at
10
mg

,
(

)
mild
induction
of
HDN
with
increased
αGST
and
μGST
at
50
mg

day
and
(

)
marked
induction
of
HDN
with
increased
αGST
,
μGST
and
albumin
at
300
mg
/
kg
/

.

HDN
induced
by
D-limonene
was
reversible
,
but
with
a
variable
renal
biomarker
pattern
over
time
:
Day
8
there
was
increased
αGST
,
μGST
and
albumin;
on
Day
15
increased
clusterin
,
albumin
and
Kim-1
.

In
summary
,
HDN
altered
the
newer
and
more
sensitive
renal
biomarkers
in
a
time
and
possibly
compound
dependent
manner
.

The
extent
of
growth

by
TT-B
of

,
but
not
of

,
was
lowered
in
a

manner
by
raising
serum
concentrations

.

TT-B
inhibited
the
cell
cycle
progression
of
SC-6
at
an
early
stage
of
the
progression
from
G0
/
G1
to

.

The
inhibition
was
again
competitive
with
serum
concentrations
in
the
culture
medium
.

No
direct
inhibition
of
DNA
synthesis
was
observed
at
the
concentration
range
which
caused
the
cell
cycle
arrest
.

TT-B
and

)
were
antagonistic
to
each
other
in
inhibiting
the
cell
cycle
progression
of
SC-6
from
G0

G1
to
S
,
suggesting
that
the
two
compounds
share
the
same
target

.

The

of
EGFR
was
little

Group
III
metabotropic
glutamate
(
mGlu
)
receptors
are
localized
in
presynaptic
terminals
within
basal
ganglia
(
BG
)
circuitry
that
become
hyperactive
due
to
dopamine
depletion
in
Parkinson's
disease
(
PD
)
.

For
this
reason
,
group
III
mGlu
receptors
,
in
particular
mGlu4
,
have
been
considered
as
key
strategic
targets
for
non-dopaminergic
pharmacological
treatments
aimed
at
modulating
these
synapses
,
without
producing
the
well
known
side-effects
of
l-DOPA
,
in
particular
the
highly
disabling
l-DOPA-induced
dyskinesia
(
LID
)
.

Herein
we
add
physiological
and
functional
support
to
this
hypothesis
using
Lu
AF21934
,
a
novel
selective
and
brain-penetrant
mGlu4
receptor
positive
allosteric
modulator
(
PAM
)
tool
compound
.

By
in

electrophysiological
recordings
we
demonstrate
that
Lu
AF21934
inhibits
corticostriatal
synaptic
transmission
and
enhances
the
effect
of
the
orthosteric
mGlu4
receptor-preferred
agonist
LSP1-2111
.

In
naïve
rats
,
Lu
AF21934
dose-dependently
(
10
and
30
mg
/
kg
)
alleviated
haloperidol-induced
catalepsy
.

In
hemiparkinsonian
rats
(
unilateral
6-hydroxydopamine
lesion
of
the
substantia
nigra
pars
compacta
)
,
Lu
AF21934
alone
did
not
affect
akinesia
at
the
doses
tested
(
10
and
30
mg
/
kg
)
.

However
,
when
Lu
AF21934
was
combined
with
sub-threshold
doses
of
l-DOPA
(
1
and
5
mg
/
kg
)
,
it
acted
synergistically
in
alleviating
akinesia
in
a
dose-dependent
manner
and
,
notably
,
also
reduced
the
incidence
of
LID
but
not
its
severity
.

Interestingly
,
these
effects
occurred
at
Lu
AF21934
brain
free
concentrations
that
showed
functional
activity
in
in
vitro
screens
(
calcium
flux
and
electrophysiology
assays
)
.

These
results
support
the
potential
for
antiparkinsonian
clinical
use
of
a
combined
treatment
consisting
in
l-DOPA
and
a
mGlu4
receptor
PAM
to
reduce
efficacious
l-DOPA
doses
(
generally
known
as
l-DOPA
sparing
)
,
while
maintaining
the

benefit
on
PD
motor
troubles

at

minimizing
the

Medulloblastoma
(
MB
)
is
the
most
common
malignant
neuroepithelial
tumor
of
childhood
.

The
DNA
topoisomerase
II
(
Topo
II
)
inhibitor
etoposide
has
been
widely
used
for
the
treatment
of
MBs;
however
,
it
remains
unknown
whether
MB
cells
are
more
sensitive
to
etoposide
than
other
malignant
neuroepithelial
tumor
cells
.

In
this
study
,
we
tested
the
chemosensitivities
of
malignant
neuroepithelial
tumors
(
26
glioblastomas
,
9
anaplastic
astrocytomas
,
and
5
MBs
)
to
etoposide
and
vincristine
using
the
succinate
dehydrogenase
inhibition
test
and
found
that
MB
cells
are
more
sensitive
to
etoposide
and
more
resistant
to
vincristine
than
other
tumor
cells
.

We
performed
quantitative
reverse-transcription
polymerase
chain
reaction
to
evaluate
the
expression
of
genes
related
to
etoposide
sensitivity
,
and
found
co-overexpression
of
DNA
topoisomerase
II
(
Topo
II
)
alpha
and
beta
mRNA
in
MBs
.

In
addition
,
the
levels
of
Topo
IIalpha
and
beta
mRNA
in
these
tumors
correlated
with
etoposide
sensitivity
.

Immunohistochemical
studies
using
surgical
samples
of
these
tumors
demonstrated
that
the
percentages
of
Topo
IIalpha
immunopositive
cells
(
Topo
IIalpha
labeling
index
)
correlated
with
those
of
Ki-67
immunopositive
cells
(
MIB-1
labeling
index
)
;
however
,
neither
the
Topo
IIalpha
nor
the
MIB-1
labeling
index
correlated
with
the
levels
of
Topo
IIalpha
mRNA
or
etoposide
sensitivity
.

Based
on
these
observations
,
Topo
IIalpha
and
beta
mRNA
expression
,
but
not
the
Topo
IIalpha
labeling
index
,
might
be
a
useful
marker
for
sensitivity
to
etoposide
in
human
malignant
neuroepithelial
tumors
.
The
detailed
molecular
mechanism
of
action
of
second-generation
BCR-ABL
tyrosine
kinase
inhibitors
,
including
perturbed
targets
and
pathways
,
should
contribute
to
rationalized
therapy
in
chronic
myeloid
leukemia
(
CML
)
or
in
other
affected
diseases
.

Here
,
we
characterized
the
target
profile
of
the
dual
SRC
/
ABL
inhibitor
bosutinib
employing
a
two-tiered
approach
using
chemical
proteomics
to
identify
natural
binders
in
whole
cell
lysates
of
primary
CML
and
K562
cells
in
parallel
to
in
vitro
kinase
assays
against
a
large
recombinant
kinase
panel
.

The
combined
strategy
resulted
in
a
global
survey
of
bosutinib
targets
comprised
of
over
45
novel
tyrosine
and
serine
/
threonine
kinases
.

We
have
found
clear
differences
in
the
target
patterns
of
bosutinib
in
primary
CML
cells
versus
the
K562
cell
line
.

A
comparison
of
bosutinib
with
dasatinib
across
the
whole
kinase
panel
revealed
overlapping
,
but
distinct
,
inhibition
profiles
.

Common
among
those
were
the
SRC
,
ABL
and
TEC
family
kinases
.

Bosutinib
did
not
inhibit
KIT
or
platelet-derived
growth
factor
receptor
,
but
prominently
targeted
the
apoptosis-linked
STE20
kinases
.

Although
in
vivo
bosutinib
is
inactive
against
ABL
T315I
,
we
found
this
clinically
important
mutant
to
be
enzymatically
inhibited
in
the
mid-nanomolar
range
.

Finally
,
bosutinib
is
the
first
kinase
inhibitor
shown
to
target
CAMK2G
,
recently
implicated
in
myeloid
leukemia
cell
proliferation
.
Reabsorption
of
amino
acids
is
an
important
function
of
the
renal
proximal
tubule
.

pH-dependent
amino
acid
transport
has
been
measured
previously
using
rabbit
renal
brush-border
membrane
vesicles
(
BBMV
)
.

The
purpose
of
this
investigation
was
to
determine
whether
this
pH-dependent
uptake
represents
H
(
+
)
/
amino
acid
cotransport
via
a
PAT1-like
transport
system
.

The
rabbit
PAT1
cDNA
was
isolated
(
2296bp
including
both
5'
and
3'
untranslated
regions
and
poly
(
A
)
tail
)
and
the
open
reading
frame
codes
for
a
protein
of
475
amino
acids
(
92%
identity
to
human
PAT1
)
.

Rabbit
PAT1
mRNA
was
found
in
all
tissues
investigated
including
kidney
.

When
expressed
heterologously
in
a
mammalian
cell
line
,
rabbit
PAT1
mediates
pH-dependent
,
Na
(
+
)
-independent
uptake
of
proline
,
glycine
,
l-alanine
and
alpha-
(
methylamino
)
isobutyric
acid
.

Proline
uptake
was
maximal
at
pH
5
.
0
(
K
(
m
)
2
.
2
+
/
-0
.
7
mM
)
.

A
transport
system
with
identical
characteristics
(
ion
dependency
,
substrate
specificity
)
was
detected
in
rabbit
renal
BBMV
where
an
overshoot
was
observed
in
the
absence
of
Na
+
but
in
the
presence
of
an
inwardly
directed
H
+
gradient
.

In
the
presence
of
Na
+
and
under
conditions
in
which
PAT1
transport
function
was
suppressed
,
a
second
proline
uptake
system
was
detected
that
exhibited
functional
characteristics
similar
to
those
of
the
IMINO
system
.

The
functional
characteristics
of
rabbit
PAT1
in
either
mammalian
cells
or
renal
BBMV
suggest
that
PAT1
is
the
low-affinity
transporter
of
proline
,
glycine
and
hydroxyproline
believed
to
be
defective
in
patients
with
iminoglycinuria
.
The
aim
of
this
work
was
to
develop
by
means
of
co-extrusion
a
multilayered
dosage
form
characterized
by
a
dual
release
profile
of
the
same
drug
.

Co-extrudates
consisted
of
two
concentric
polymer
matrices
:
a
core
having
a
lipophilic
character
and
a
coat
with
a
hydrophilic
character
.

Diclofenac
sodium
(
DS
)
was
incorporated
as
model
drug
in
both
layers
.

Several
polymers
were
screened
on
the
basis
of
their
processability
via
hot
melt
extrusion
(
HME
)
and
in
vitro
drug
release
.

Polymer
combinations
with
suitable
properties
(
i
.

e
.

,
similar
extrusion
temperature
,
appropriate
drug
release
profile
)
were
processed
via
co-extrusion
.

(
Co-
)
extruded
samples
were
characterized
in
terms
of
solid
state
(
XRD
,
SEM
)
,
in
vitro
drug
release
,
core
/
coat
adhesion
,
and
bioavailability
.

Based
on
the
polymer
screening
,
two
polymer
combinations
were
selected
for
co-extrusion
:
ethylcellulose
(
core
)
combined
with
Soluplus®
(
coat
)
and
polycaprolactone
(
core
)
with
PEO
(
coat
)
.

These
combinations
were
successfully
co-extruded
.

XRD
revealed
that
DS
remained
crystalline
during
extrusion
in
ethylcellulose
,
Soluplus®
,
polycaprolactone
,
and
PEO
.

The
polycaprolactone
/
PEO
combination
could
be
processed
at
a
lower
temperature
(
70°C
)
,
vs
.

140°C
for
ethylcellulose
/
Soluplus®
.

The
maximum
drug
load
in
core
and
coat
depended
on
the
extrusion
temperature
and
the
die
dimensions
,
while
adhesion
between
core
and
coat
was
mainly
determined
by
the
drug
load
and
by
the
extrusion
temperature
.

In
vitro
drug
release
from
the
co-extruded
formulations
was
reflected
in
the

This
study
investigated
the
effects
of
suramin
,
a
polysulfonated
naphthylurea
,
on
the
outcome
of
steatotic

Rat

were
harvested
after

were
significantly
higher
after

Suramin
(

decreased

,
hyperbilirubinemia

,

,
and
apoptosis
by
70%
after
FPG

.

Hepatic
cellular
5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine

increased
to
28%
in

but
was
only

increased
to

in

but
was

Suramin
increased

and
the

to
43%
and
9%
,
respectively
,
in
FPG
.

All
FPG
recipients
died
within
5
days
.

Suramin
recovered
survival
of
FPG
to
62%
.

Tumor
necrosis

(
TNF-α
)
mRNA
was

2-fold
higher
in
FPG
than
in
LPG
and
was
associated
with
activation
of

Suramin
decreased
TNF-α

caspase
activation
in

.

Transforming

TGF-β
)
,
phospho-Smad2

were
significantly
higher
in
FPG
than
in
LPG
and
suramin
blocked
TGF-β
formation
and
its
down-stream

pathway
.

Taken
together
,
suramin
improves
the
outcome
of
FPG
transplantation
,
most
likely
by
inhibition
of
TNF-α

TGF-β
formation
.
It
has
recently
been
shown
that
high-fat
diets
induce
the
expression
of
peroxisome
proliferator-activated
receptor
(
PPAR
)
with
a
concomitant
decrease
in
expression
of
retinoic
acid
(
RAR
)
and
triiodothyronine
(
TR
)
receptors
in
rat
liver
.

The
authors
have
suggested
that
PPAR
activation
may
be
responsible
for
these
modifications
in
nuclear
receptor
expression
.

With
the
aim
of
gaining
further
insight
into
a
possible
relationship
between
the
patterns
of
expression
of
these
receptors
,
we
have
examined
,
using
a
pharmacological
model
,
the
effect
of
a
strong
and
specific
PPAR
activation
induced
by
bezafibrate
,
a
peroxisome
proliferator
agent
.

Activation
of
PPAR
was
evaluated
by
quantifying
PPAR
alpha
mRNA
and
acyl-CoA
oxidase
mRNA
.

The
expression
of
RAR
and
TR
was
determined
by
assaying
the
binding
properties
of
these
nuclear
receptors
and
by
quantifying
the
mRNA
level
of
RAR
beta
and
TR
alpha1
,
beta1
isoforms
.

After
a
10
day
treatment
of
young
rats
,
induction
of
PPAR
(
PPAR
alpha
mRNA
was
increased
by
40%
[
P<
0
.
05
and
acyl-CoA
oxidase
mRNA
by
411%
[
P<0
.
001
]
)
and
a
concomitant
decrease
of
RAR
and
TR
expression
(
Maximal
Binding
Capacity
was
decreased
by
21
and
26%
,
respectively
[
P<0
.
05
]
)
in
the
liver
was
observed
.

RXR
alpha
mRNA
expression
was
unchanged
by
treatment
.

Cross-talk
between
RAR
,
TR
and
PPAR
signalling
pathways
may
be
implicated
in
the
new
patterns
of
nuclear
receptor
expression
observed
.

The
decreased
expression
of
RAR
and
TR
reported
here
could
provide
a
novel
element
for
the
understanding
of
the
link
between
PPAR
and
tumorigenesis
in
rat
liver
.
In
this
study
,
we
investigated
the
effect
of
dexamethasone
on
the
synthesis
of
steroidogenic
acute
regulatory
protein
(
StAR
)
and
the
expression
of
DAX-1
(

region
on
the
X
chromosome
,
gene

)
and
SF-1
(
steroidogenic
factor-1
)
in
vivo
.

Male
rats
were
treated
with
dexamethasone
(
0
.
4
and
4
mg
/
kg
body
wt
per
day
)
by
intraperitoneal
injections
using
phosphate-buffered
saline
as
the
vehicle
for
7
d
.

At
the
end
of
7
d
,
serum
testosterone
levels
were
decreased
.

Response
to
luteinizing
hormone
(
LH
)
and
8-bromo-cyclic-AMP
(
8-Br-cAMP
)
in
vitro
was
reduced
in
testicular
cells
isolated
from
dexamethasone-treated
rat
testes
.

Dexamethasone
decreased
LH-stimulated
cAMP
production
.

The
conversion
of
22
(
R
)
-hydroxycholesterol
,
pregnenolone
,
17-hydroxypregnenolone
,
dehydroepiandrosterone
,
and
androstenedione
to
testosterone
was
not
affected
by
dexamethasone
.

Dexamethasone
increased
DAX-1
expression
and
concordantly
decreased
StAR
protein
and
mRNA
in
testicular
cells
.

The
increase
in
DAX-1
protein
corresponded
to
a
57%
reduction
in
StAR
mRNA
levels
concomitant
with
a
79%
reduction
in
serum
testosterone
levels
.

Dexamethasone
had
no
effect
on
the
level
of
SF-1
,
but
increased
the
amount
of
complexed
DAX-1-SF-1
.

Dexamethasone
in
vitro
suppressed
StAR
promoter
activity
when
an
increasing
amount
of
DAX-1
cDNA
was
transfected
.

These
results
demonstrate
that
dexamethasone
increases
expression
of
DAX-1
,
which
results
in
increased
amounts
of
complexed
DAX-1-SF-1
,
in
the
absence
of
any
change
in
the
expression
of
SF-1
.

These
observations
strongly
support
the
concept
that
dexamethasone
suppresses
rat
testicular
testosterone
production
,
at
least
in
part
,
by
increasing
the
amount
of
complexed
DAX-1-SF-1
in
these
cells
,
which
leads
directly
to
decreased
availability
of
free
SF-1
and
,
therefore
,
decreased
activation
of
transcription
of
the
rat
StAR
gene
.

and
the
different
isozymes
showed
very
variable
inhibition
profiles
with
these
derivatives
.

Phenols
like
the
ones
investigated
here
possess
a
CA
inhibition
mechanism
distinct
of
that
of
the
sulfonamides
/
sulfamates
used
clinically
or
the
coumarins
.

Unlike
the
sulfonamides
,
which
bind
to
the
catalytic
zinc
ion
,
phenols
are
anchored
at
the
Zn
(

)
-coordinated
water
molecule
and
bind
more
externally
within
the
active
site
cavity
,
making
contacts
with
various
amino
acid
residues
.

As
this
is
the
region
with
the
highest
variability
between
the
many
CA
isozymes
found
in
mammals
,
this
class
of
compounds
may
lead
to
isoform-selective
inhibitors
targeting
just
one
or

of
the
medicinally
relevant
CAs
.

We
have
investigated
the
effects
of
volatile
anaesthetics
on
electron
transport
chain
activity
in
the
mammalian
heart
.

Halothane
,
isoflurane
and
sevoflurane
reversibly
increased
NADH
fluorescence
(
autofluorescence
)
in
intact
ventricular
myocytes
of
guinea-pig
,
suggesting
that
NADH
oxidation
was
impaired
.

Using
pig
heart
submitochondrial
particles
we
found
that
the
anaesthetics
dose-dependently
inhibited
NADH
oxidation
in
the
order
:
halothane
>
isoflurane
=
sevoflurane
.

Succinate
oxidation
was
unaffected
by
either
isoflurane
or
sevoflurane
,
indicating
that
these
agents
selectively
inhibit
complex
I
(
NADH
:
ubiquinone
oxidoreductase
)
.

In
addition
to
inhibiting
NADH
oxidation
,
halothane
also
inhibited
succinate
oxidation
(
and
succinate
dehydrogenase
)
,
albeit
to
a
lesser
extent
.

To
test
the
hypothesis
that
complex
I
is
a
target
of
volatile
anaesthetics
,
we
examined
the
effects
of
these
agents
on
NADH
:
ubiquinone
oxidoreductase
(
EC
1
.
6
.
99
.
3
)
activity
using
the
ubiquinone
analogue
DBQ
(
decylubiquinone
)
as
substrate
.

Halothane
,
isoflurane
and
sevoflurane
dose-dependently
inhibited
NADH
:
DBQ
oxidoreductase
activity
.

Unlike
the
classical
inhibitor
rotenone
,
none
of
the
anaesthetics
completely
inhibited
enzyme
activity
at
high
concentration
,
suggesting
that
these
agents
bind
weakly
to
the
'hydrophobic
inhibitory
site'
of
complex
I
.

In
conclusion
,
halothane
,
isoflurane
and
sevoflurane
inhibit
complex
I
(
NADH
:
ubiquinone
oxidoreductase
)
of
the
electron
transport
chain
.

At
concentrations
of
approximately
2
MAC
(
minimal
alveolar
concentration
)
,
the
activity
of
NADH
:
ubiquinone
oxidoreductase
was
reduced
by
about
20
%
in
the
presence
of
halothane
or
isoflurane
,
and
by
about
10
%
in
the
presence
of
sevoflurane
.

These
inhibitory
effects
are
unlikely
to
compromise
cardiac
performance
at
usual
clinical
concentrations
,
but
may
contribute
to
the
mechanism
by
which
volatile
anaesthetics
induce
pharmacological
preconditioning
.
ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL
RELEVANCE
:
Licorice
(
Glycyrrhiza
uralensis
Fisch
.

,
Leguminosae
)
has
been
used
in
herbal
medicine
and
food
supplement
worldwide
for
centuries
.

Licorice
is
a
common
ingredient
of
several
prescriptions
of
traditional
Chinese
medicine
which
have
been
proved
to
inhibit
infection
of
human
respiratory
syncytial
virus
(
HRSV
)
.

There
are
two
preparations
of
licorice
,
Radix
Glycyrrhizae
and
Radix
Glycyrrhizae
Preparata
.

However
,
it
is
unknown
whether
licorice
or
which
preparation
of
licorice
is
effective
against
HRSV
,
nor
is
its
active
constituent
.

AIM
OF
THE
STUDY
:
We
tested
the
hypothesis
that
Radix
Glycyrrhizae
can
effectively
decrease
HRSV-induced
plaque
formation
in
respiratory
mucosal
cell
lines
.

We
also
tried
to
find
out
the
active
constituent
.

MATERIALS
AND
METHODS
:
Anti-HRSV
activities
of
hot
water
extracts
of
preparations
of
licorice
,
glycyrrhizin
and
18β-glycyrrhetinic
acid
(
18β-GA
)
,
the
active
constituents
of
licorice
,
were
examined
by
plaque
reduction
assay
in
both
human
upper
(
HEp-2
)
and
low
(
A549
)
respiratory
tract
cell
lines
.

Abilities
of
crude
licorice
to
inhibit
viral
replication
and
to
stimulate
IFN-β
were
evaluated
by
reverse
transcription
polymerase
chain
reaction
(
RT-PCR
)
and
enzyme-linked
immunosorbent
assay
(
ELISA
)
,
respectively
.

RESULTS
:
Radix
Glycyrrhizae
and
Radix
Glycyrrhizae
Preparata
dose-dependently
inhibited
HRSV-induced
plaque
formation
in
both
HEp-2
and
A549
cell
lines
(
p<0
.
0001
)
.

The
effect
of
Radix
Glycyrrhizae
was
better
than
that
of
Radix
Glycyrrhizae
Preparata
on
HEp-2
cells
.

However
,
there
was
no
difference
of
their
anti-HRSV
effects
on
A549
cells
.

Besides
,
glycyrrhizin
was
ineffective
at
all
.

Nevertheless
,
18β-GA
showed
a
potent
anti-HRSV
activity
.

Radix
Glycyrrhizae
was
more
effective
when
given
before
viral
inoculation
(
p<0
.
0001
)
which
may
be
due
to
its
inhibition
of
viral
attachment
on
(
p<0
.
0001
)
and
penetration
(
p<0
.
0001
)
into
the
host
cells
.

The
anti-HRSV
activity
of
Radix
Glycyrrhizae
was
further
confirmed
by
RT-PCR
and
qRT-PCR
.

300μg
/
ml
Radix
Glycyrrhizae
markedly
decreased
the
viral
amounts
within
the
cells
and
in
the
suspension
.

Radix
Glycyrrhizae
might
further
stimulate
mucosal
cells
to
secrete
IFN-β
to
counteract
viral
infection
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
Both
Radix
Glycyrrhizae
and
Radix
Glycyrrhizae
Preparata
are
effective
against
HRSV
infection
on
airway
epithelial
cells
.

Radix
Glycyrrhizae
inhibited
HRSV
mainly
by
preventing
viral
attachment
,
internalization
,
and
by
stimulating
IFN
secretion
.

of
its
active
constituents

Ribavirin
is
a
nucleoside
,
guanosine
analogue
,
whose
mechanisms
of
action
include
inhibition
of
inosine

(
IMPDH
)
,
which
is
the
key
step
in
de

synthesis
,
a
requirement
for

replication
.

In
combination
with
pegylated
interferon
alfa
,
ribavirin
is
the
standard
of
care
for
the
treatment
of
chronic
hepatitis
C
today
.

However
,
the
medication
is
associated
with
significant
haemolytic
anaemia
,
which
may
require
dose
reduction
,
discontinuation
or
treatment
with
recombinant
human
erythropoietin
.

Dose
reduction
also
appears
to
decrease
sustained
viral
clearance
rates
.

Newer
IMPDH
inhibitors
are
in
various
stages
of
development
.

Viramidine
,
a
liver-targeting
prodrug
of
ribavirin
,
has
demonstrated
significant
antiviral
activity
and
erythrocyte-sparing
properties

It
is
currently
in
Phase
3
trials
.

Clinical
trials
of
merimepodib
,
another
investigational
IMPDH
inhibitor
,
have
completed
enrolment
for
a
Phase
2b
study
as
a
third
medication
for
administration
with
pegylated
interferon
plus
ribavirin
.

Although
other
IMDPH
inhibitors
also
have
antiviral
activity
,
these
medications
appear
best
suited
as
immunosuppressive
medications
at
this
time
.

9-Methoxycamptothecin
(
MCPT
)
has
been
recently
reported
to
have
a
strong
anticancer
activity
.

However
,
its
detailed
mechanism
of
action
in
human
cancer
cells
has
not
been
well
clarified
.

The
results
showed
that
MCPT
induced
cytotoxicity
in
seven
human
cancer
cell
lines
in
a
dose
dependent
manner
after
72h
,
with
A2780
and
Hela
cell
lines
more
sensitive
,
so
the
two
cell
lines
were
chosen
to
do
further
studies
.

MCPT
induced
strong
G2

M
arrest
in
both
A2780
cells
and
Hela
cells
after
24h
,
following
by
substantial
sub-G1
arrest
(
indicating
apoptosis
)
.

The
apoptosis
was
verified
by
staining
with
Annexin
V-FITC
and
propidium
iodide
.

ROS
generation
increased
significantly
in
MCPT-induced
apoptosis
.

Meanwhile
,
the
apoptosis
appeared
to
be
dependent
on
caspase-3
,
-8
and
-9
in
A2780
cells
,
and
caspase-3
in
Hela
cells
.

In
addition
,

Taken

MCPT
plays
an
important
role
in
tumor

by
inducing
apoptosis
in

is
described
.

Also
provided
is
a
detailed
account
of
the
development
of
a
multigram
scale
synthesis
of
the
diazatricyclic
ring
system
,
which
was
achieved
using
a
Hofmann-Löffler-Freytag
reaction
as
the
key
step
.

The
basis
for
the
use
of
this
complex
framework
lies
in
an
attempt
to
constrain
one
end
of
the
molecule
in
the
"agonist
conformation"
as
was
previously
described
for

.

Optimization
of
carbamate
analogues
of
the
diazatricylic
compounds
led
to
the
identification
of
32i
as
a
potent
agonist
of
the
GPR119
receptor
with
low

.

The
use
of
an
agonist

efficiency
(
LLE
)
termed
AgLLE
is
discussed
along
with
the
issues
of
applying
efficiency
measures
to
agonist
programs
.

Ultimately
,
solubility
limited
absorption
and
poor
exposure
reduced
further
interest
in
these
molecules
.
The
purpose
of
this
investigation
was
to
design
novel
pentablock
copolymers
(
polylatide-polycaprolactone-polyethylene
glycol-
polycaprolactone-polylatide
)
(
PLA-PCL-PEG-PCL-PLA
)
to
prepare
nanoparticle
formulations
which
provide
continuous
delivery
of
steroids
over
a
longer
duration
with
minimal
burst
effect
.

Another
purpose
was
to
evaluate
the
effect
of
poly

L-lactide
)

PLLA
)
or

and
in

of

)
from
nanoparticles
.

PLA-PCL-PEG-PCL-PLA
copolymers
with
different
block
ratio
of
PCL
/
PLA
segment
were
synthesized
.

Release
of
triamcinolone
acetonide
from
nanoparticles
was
significantly
affected
by
crystallinity
of
the
copolymers
.

Burst
release
of
triamcinolone
acetonide
from
nanoparticles
was
significantly
minimized
with
incorporation
of
proper
ratio
of
PDLLA
in
the
existing
triblock
(
PCL-PEG-PCL
)
copolymer
.

Moreover
,
pentablock
copolymer
based
nanoparticles
exhibited
continuous
release
of
triamcinolone
acetonide
.

Pentablock
copolymer
based
nanoparticles
can
be
utilized
to
achieve
continuous
near
zero-order
delivery
of
corticosteroids
from
nanoparticles

Estrogens
,
and
particularly
glucuronides
such
as
ethinylestradiol
(
EE
)
,
have
been
shown
to
cause
cholestasis
in
animal
studies
,
by
reducing
bile
acid
uptake
by
hepatocytes
.

The
aim
of
the
present
article
was
to
investigate
anticholestatic
activity
of
resveratrol
(
RES
)
against
liver
cholestasis
induced
by
EE
in
adult
female
rats
.

The
daily
oral
administration
of
the
RES
at
a
concentration
of
25
mg
/
kg
body
weight
for
15
days
to
rats
treated
with
EE
(
100
μg
/
kg
body
weight
for
5
days
)
resulted
in
a
significant
protection
against
EE-induced
decrease
in
both
serum
cholesterol
and
bile
acid
levels
as
well
as
against
an
increase
of
serum
bilirubin
concentration
.

The
treatment
also
resulted
in
a
significant
increase
in
hepatic
superoxide
dismutase
,
glutathione
peroxidase
,
glutathione
reductase
,
and
catalase
activities
as
well
as
hepatic
protein-bound
and
nonprotein
sulfhydryl
groups
.

RES
inhibited
serum
alkaline
phosphatase
,
alanine
aminotransferase
,
pi-glutathione-S-transferase
,
gamma-glutamyl
transpeptidase
,
and
alpha-glutathione-S-transferase
activities
,
as
well
as
reduced
serum
tumor
necrosis
factor-alpha
,
nitric
oxide
,
and
hepatic
malondialdehyde
as
compared
to
EE-treated
rats
.

The
results
clearly
suggest
that
RES
has
a
powerful
prophylactic
action
in
cholestasis
induced
by
EE
.

Taken
together
,
RES
has
potential
as
a
preventive
and
therapeutic
agent
for
cholestasis
and
deserves
clinical
trial
in
the
near
future
as
an
adjuvant
therapy
in
women
treated
with

Ghrelin
is
a
stomach-derived
orexigenic
peptide
.

The
goal
of
the
study
was
to
investigate
the
roles
of
mu
and
kappa
opioid
receptors
in
systemic
ghrelin-mediated
regulation
of
the
mesolimbic
dopamine
system
.

To
evaluate
the
interaction
of
systemic
ghrelin
with
values
of
food
reward
,
rats
were
exposed
to
food
removal
,
regular
food
or
palatable
food
after
systemic
ghrelin
administration
.

Extracellular
dopamine
levels
were
quantified
in
the
nucleus
accumbens
(
NAc
)
and
receptor-specific
compounds
were
infused
into
the
ventral
tegmental
area
(
VTA
)
using
dual-probe
microdialysis
.

Consumption
of
regular
or
palatable
food
without
systemic
ghrelin
administration
induced
an
increase
in
dopamine
levels
in
the
NAc
via
activation
of
mu
opioid
receptors
in
the
VTA
.

Systemic
ghrelin
administration
(
3
nmol
,
i
.

v
.

)
followed
by
no
food
induced
a
decrease
in
dopamine
levels
via
activation
of
kappa
opioid
receptors
in
the
VTA
.

Systemic
ghrelin
administration
followed
by
consumption
of
regular
food
induced
an
increase
in
dopamine
levels
via
preferential
activation
of
mu
opioid
receptors
,
whereas
systemic
ghrelin
administration
followed
by
consumption
of
palatable
food
suppressed
the
increase
in
dopamine
levels
via
preferential
activation
of
kappa
opioid
receptors
.

Thus
,
natural
food
reward
and
systemic
ghrelin
activate
mu
and
kappa
opioid
receptor
pathways
in
the
VTA
,
respectively
,
resulting
in
opposite
influences
on
dopamine
release
in
the
NAc
.

Furthermore
,
systemic
ghrelin
induces
switching
of
the
dominant
opioid
receptor
pathway
for
highly
rewarding
food
from
mu
to
kappa
,
resulting
in
suppression
of
the
mesolimbic
dopamine
system
.

These
novel
findings
might
provide
insights
into
the
neural
pathways
involved
in
eating

UNLABELLED
:
Long
standing
confusion
exists
in
the
terminology
of
hypokalaemic
salt-losing
tubulopathies
(
SLTs
)
.

SLTs
are
autosomal
recessively
transmitted
and
characterized
by
normotensive
secondary
hyperreninism
/
hyperaldosteronism
with
hypokalaemic
metabolic
alkalosis
.

Historically
,
four
phenotypical
variants
have
been
described
:
(
1
)
the
(
classic
)
Bartter
syndrome
(
cBS
)
,
(
2
)
the
hypomagnesaemic
hypocalciuric
Gitelman
syndrome
(
GS
)
,
(

)
the
hypercalciuric
hyperprostaglandin-E-syndrome
(
HPS
)
or
antenatal
Bartter
syndrome
(
aBS
)
and
(
4
)
the
hyperprostaglandin-E-syndrome
with
sensorineural
deafness
(
HPS
+
SND
)
.

The
latter
two
syndromes
are
the
most
severe
variants
with
antenatal
manifestation
with
polyhydramnios
and
life-threatening
course
of
salt-
and
water-loss
.

Defects
in
five
renal
membrane
proteins
involved
in

have
been
identified
:
In
HPS-patients
mutations
in
(

)
either
the
furosemide-sensitive
sodium-potassium-chloride
cotransporter
NKCC2
,
or
(
2
)
in
the
potassium
channel
ROMK
have
been
identified
,
and
(
3
)
HPS
+
SND
is
caused
by
mutations
in
the
beta-subunit
of
the
chloride
channels
ClC-Kb
and

(
named
barttin
)
,
all
mimicking
the
major
pharmacological
effects
of
furosemide
with
minor
potassium-wasting
in
ROMK-patients
as
seen
in
patients
treated
with
simultaneous
furosemide
and
amiloride
,
and
minor
calcium-wasting
in
Barttin-patients
resembling
the
combination
of
furosemide
and
thiazides
.

(

)
cBS
is
caused
by
mutations
in
the
chloride
channel
ClC-Kb
with
similar
clinical
characteristics
as
seen
under
combination
of
thiazides
and
furosemide
,
(

)
GS
is
caused
by
mutations
in
the
thiazide-sensitive
sodium-chloride
cotransporter
NCCT
resembling
the
effect
of
long-term
thiazide
administration
.

CONCLUSION
:
The
combination
of
pharmacology
and
genetics
suggests
a
new
terminology
for
the
above
described
SLTs
:
Furosemide-like-SLT
for
HPS
caused
by
NKCC2-mutations
,
furosemide
/
amiloride-like-SLT

Vitamin
A
or
retinol
is
arguably
the
most
multifunctional
vitamin
in
the
human
body
as
it
is
essential
from
embryogenesis
to
adulthood
.

The
pleiotropic
effects
of
vitamin
A
are
exerted
mainly
by
one
active
metabolite
,
all-trans
retinoic
acid
(
atRA
)
,
which
regulates
the
expression
of
a
battery
of
target
genes
through
several
families
of
nuclear
receptors
(
RARs
,
RXRs
and
PPARβ
/
δ
)
,
polymorphic
retinoic
acid
(
RA
)
response
elements
and
multiple
coregulators
.

It
also
involves
extra
nuclear
and
non-transcriptional
effects
such
as
the
activation
of
kinase
cascades
,
which
are
integrated
in
the
nucleus
via
the
phosphorylation
of
several
actors
of
RA
signaling
.

However
,
vitamin
A
itself
proved
recently
to
be
active
and
RARs
to
be
present
in
the
cytosol
to
regulate
translation
and
cell
plasticity
.

All
these
new
concepts
expand
the
scope
of
the
biologic
functions
of
vitamin
A
and
RA
.
Using
the
alpha
1-adrenoceptor
subtype-selective
antagonists
chlorethylclonidine
(
CEC
)
,
WB4101
,
and
5-methyl-urapidil
,
we
have
examined
the
possible
heterogeneity
in
the
alpha
1-adrenoceptor
populations
in
rabbit
aorta
.

The
alpha
1-adrenoceptor
alkylating
agent
CEC
selectively
inhibited
the
phasic
component
of
the
norepinephrine-induced
contractile
response
,
with
little
effect
on
the
tonic
component
.

The
alpha
1-adrenoceptor
occupancy-response
relationship
defined
by
the
phenoxybenzamine
inactivation
method
was
rectangular
hyperbolic
for
the
tonic
response
,
whereas
that
for
the
phasic
response
was
linear
,
indicating
the
different
degree
of
receptor
reserve
for
the
two
responses
.

Radioligand
binding
studies
with
the
nonselective
alpha
1-adrenoceptor
antagonist
radioligand
125I-BE2254
showed
that
73-87%
of
the
binding
sites
in
rabbit
aorta
are
CEC
sensitive
and
they
are
predominantly
low
affinity
sites
both
for
WB4101
(
pKd
=
8
.
1
)
and
for
5-methylurapidil
(
pKd
=
7
.
1
)
.

Moreover
,
alpha
1-adrenoceptor-mediated
phosphatidylinositol
(
PI
)
hydrolysis
was
CEC
sensitive
,
and
fractional
inactivation
of
alpha
1
receptors
with
CEC
showed
equivalent
increments
in
the
reduction
of
PI
hydrolysis
and
phasic
contractile
response
,
suggesting
that
both
responses
are
linearly
related
to
the
CEC-sensitive
receptor
sites
.

The
Schild

for
the
competitive
antagonists
WB4101
and
5-methyl-urapidil
against
alpha
1a-adrenoceptor-selective

contraction
were
linear
and
had
slopes
not
significantly
different
from
unity
,
with

for

However
,
the
Schilod

for
these
antagonists
against
norepinephrine
were
curvilinear
.

Computer-assisted
analysis
of
these
curvilinear
Schild
plots
in
a
two-receptor
system
indicated
that
alpha
1-adrenoceptor
populations
responsible
for
the
constrictive
response
are
predominantly
(
approximately
80-90%
)
low
affinity
sites
for
the
two
antagonists
(
pKd
approximately
8
.
1
for
WB4101
and
pKd
approximately
7
.
1
for
5-methyl-urapidil
)
and
a
small
population
(
approximately
10-20%
)
are
high
affinity
sites
(
pKd
approximately
9

for
both
WB4101

,
which
was

ABSTRACT
TRUNCATED

UNLABELLED
:
Trifluorothymidine
(
TFT
)
can
be
phosphorylated
by
thymidine
kinase
(
TK
)
to
TFTMP
which
can
inhibit
thymidylate
synthase
(
TS
)
,
resulting
in
depletion
of
thymidine
nucleotides
.

TFT
can
be
degraded
by
thymidine
phosphorylase
(
TP
)
which
can
be
inhibited
by
thymidine
phosphorylase
inhibitor
(
TPI
)
.

Using
the
TS
in

Inhibition
Assay
(
TSIA
)
FM3A
breast
cancer
cells
were
exposed
4
h
or
24
h
to
TFT
and
5-Fluorouracil
(
5FU
)
.

TS
activity
reduced
to
9%
(
0

1
microM

)
and
58%
(
1
microM

)
after
4
h
exposure
and
to
6%
(
TFT
)
and
21%
(
5FU
)
after
24
h
exposure
.

TPI
did
not
affect
TS
inhibition
by
TFT
.

FM3A
cells
lacking
TK
or
TS
activity
(
FM3A
/
TK-
)
were
far
less
sensitive
to
TFT
compared
to
FM3A
cells
.

CONCLUSION
:
TFT
can
be
taken
up
and
activated
very
rapidly
by
FM3A
cancer
cells
,
probably
due
to
favourable
TK
enzyme
properties
,
and
TPI
did
not

Follicle-stimulating
hormone
(
FSH
)
,
a
dimeric
glycoprotein
synthesized
in
the
anterior
pituitary
gland
,
is
important
for
the
production
of
sex
steroids
and
gametes
.

FSH-beta
(
FSH
beta
)
and
FSH
receptor
(
FSHR
)
knockout
mice
display
impaired
ovarian
follicular
development
and
infertility
in
females
and
small
testes
,
oligospermia
,
and
fertility
in
males
.

Humans
with
FSH
beta
gene
mutations
tend
to
have
a
more
severe
phenotype
than
those
with
FSHR
gene
mutations
,
although
infertility
and
varying
degrees
of
impaired
sex
steroid
production
occur
in
both
types
of
mutations
.

Data
from
human
and
mouse
mutations
in
the
FSH
beta
and
FSHR
genes
suggest
that
FSH
is
necessary
for
normal
pubertal
development
and
fertility
in
males
and
females
.

Wide-ranging
exploration

led
to
the
discovery

AZD5363
,
which
showed
increased
potency
,
reduced
hERG

,
and
higher

This
compound
demonstrated
good
preclinical
drug
metabolism
and
pharmacokinetics
(
DMPK
)
properties
and
,
after
oral
dosing
,
showed
pharmacodynamic
knockdown
of

biomarkers
in

,
and
inhibition
of

We
report
here
that
amitriptyline
,
an
antidepressant
drug
,
directly
binds
TrkA

triggers
their

Amitriptyline
,

not
any
other

,
promotes

domain
of
both
TrkA
and
TrkB
and
promotes
TrkA-TrkB
receptor
heterodimerization
.

Truncation
of
amitriptyline
binding
motif
on
TrkA
abrogates
the
receptor
dimerization
by
amitriptyline
.

Administration
of
amitriptyline
to
mice
activates
both
receptors
and
significantly
reduces
kainic
acid-triggered
neuronal
cell
death
.

Inhibition
of
TrkA
,
but
not
TrkB
,
abolishes
amitriptyline's
neuroprotective
effect
without
impairing
its
antidepressant
activity
.

Thus
,
amitriptyline
acts
as
a
TrkA
and
TrkB
agonist
and
possesses
marked
neurotrophic
activity
.
Polybrominated
diphenyl
ethers
(
PBDEs
)
were
widely
used
flame
retardants
that
have
become
persistent
environmental
pollutants
.

In
the
present
study
,
we
investigated
the
in
vitro
oxidative
metabolism
of
2
,
2'
,
4
,
4'-tetrabromodiphenyl
ether
(
BDE-47
)
,
a
major
PBDE
detected
in
human
tissue
and
environmental
samples
.

Biotransformation
of
BDE-47
by
pooled
and
individual
human
liver
microsomes
and
by
human
recombinant
cytochrome
P450
(
P450
)
enzymes
was
assessed
using
a
liquid
chromatography
/
tandem
mass
spectrometry-based
method
.

Of
the
nine
hydroxylated
metabolites
of
BDE-47
produced
by
human
liver
microsomes
,
seven
metabolites
were
identified
using
authentic
standards
.

A
monohydroxy-tetrabrominated
and
a
dihydroxy-tetrabrominated
metabolite
remain
unidentified
.

Kinetic
analysis
of
the
rates
of
metabolite
formation
revealed
that
the
major
metabolites
were
5-hydroxy-2
,
2'
,
4
,
4'-tetrabromodiphenyl
ether
(
5-OH-BDE-47
)
,
6-hydroxy-2
,
2'
,
4
,
4'-tetrabromodiphenyl
ether
(
6-OH-BDE-47
)
,
and
possibly
the
unidentified
monohydroxy-tetrabrominated
metabolite
.

Among
the
human
recombinant
P450
enzymes
tested
,
P450
2B6
was
the
most
active
enzyme
in
the
formation
of
the
hydroxylated
metabolites
of
BDE-47
.

Moreover
,
the
formation
of
all
metabolites
of
BDE-47
by
pooled
human
liver
microsomes
was
inhibited
by
a
P450
2B6-specific
antibody
and
was
highly
correlated
with
P450
2B6-mediated
activity
in
single
donor
liver
microsomes
indicating
that
P450
2B6
was
the
major
P450
responsible
for
the
biotransformation
of
BDE-47
.

Additional
experiments
involving
the
incubation
of
liver
microsomes
with
individual
monohydroxy-tetrabrominated
metabolites
in
place
of
BDE-47
demonstrated
that
2
,
4-dibromophenol
was
a
product
of
BDE-47
and
several
primary
metabolites
,
but
the
dihydroxy-tetrabrominated
metabolite
was
not
formed
by
sequential
hydroxylation
of
any
of
the
monohydroxy-tetrabrominated
metabolites
tested
.

The
present
study
provides
a
comprehensive
characterization
of
the
oxidative
metabolism
of
BDE-47
by
human
liver
microsomes
and
P450
2B6
.
ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL
RELEVANCE
:
Cyperi
Rhizoma
has
commonly
been
used
for
the
treatment
of
gynecological
and
neuropsychiatric
disorders
in
traditional
medicine
.

The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
evaluate
the
estrogenic
properties
and
neuroprotective
effects
of
Cyperi
Rhizoma
under
estrogen-deprived
condition
in
female
mice
.

MATERIALS
AND
METHODS
:
To
determine
the
estrogen-like
effect
of
Cyperi
Rhizoma
extract
(
CRE
)
,
we
measured
luciferase
expression
after
transfection
of
a
promoter
construct
containing
an
estrogen
response
element
(
ERE
)
and
treatment
of
CRE
.

To
evaluate
the
neuroprotective
effect
of
CRE
,
we
measured
striatal
dopamine
,
movement
ability
,
tyrosine
hydroxylase
(
TH
)
immunoreactivity
,
and
apoptosis-related
protein
expression
levels
after
treatment
of
CRE
either
with
or
without
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1
,
2
,
3
,
6-tetrahydropyridine
(
MPTP
)
in
ovariectomized
female
mice
.

RESULTS
:
CRE
significantly
induced
the
luciferase
expression
driven
by
an
ERE
in
PC12
cells
,
a
dopaminergic
cell
line
,
in
a
dose-dependent
manner
.

In
mice
,
MPTP
significantly
decreased
the
levels
of
dopamine
in
the
striatum
and
behavior
performance;
in
contrast
,
both
CRE
and
17β-estradiol
benzoate
(
EB
)
recovered
these
parameters
to
normal
levels
.

CRE
and
EB
treatment
also
recovered
TH
immunopositive
fibers
and
cells
,
respectively
,
from
MPTP
toxicity
.

Additionally
,
MPTP
significantly
down-regulated
Bcl-2
expression
in
the
mitochondria
of
dopaminergic
cells
in
the
SN
,
followed
by
an
increase
in
Bax
expression
,
cytochrome
C
translocation
to
the
cytosol
,
andcleaved-caspase-3
expression
,
whereas
these
were
inhibited
by
CRE
or
EB
treatment
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
These
findings
provide
the
first
evidence
that
CRE
has
estrogen-like
and
neuroprotective
effects
on
dopaminergic
neurons
in
estrogen-deprived
mice
treated
with
MPTP-toxin
.
Serotonin
transporters
(
SERT
)
play
an
essential
role
in
the
termination
and
regulation
of
serotonin
signaling
in
the
brain
.

SERT
is
also
the
target
of
antidepressants
and
psychostimulants
.

Molecules
with
novel
activities
and
modes
of
interaction
with
regard
to
SERT
function
are
of
great
scientific
and
clinical
interest
.

We
explored
structural
regions
outside
the
putative
serotonin
translocation
pathway
to
identify
potential
binding
sites
for
allosteric
transporter
modulators
(
ATMs
)
.

Mutational
studies
revealed
a
pocket
of
amino
acids
outside
the
orthosteric
substrate
binding
sites
located
in
the
interface
between
extracellular
loops
1
and
3
that
when
mutated
affect
transporter
function
.

Using
the
structure
of
the
bacterial
transporter
homologue
leucine
transporter
as
a
template
,
we
developed
a
structural
model
of
SERT
.

We
performed
molecular
dynamics
simulations
to
further
characterize
the
allosteric
pocket
that
was
identified
by
site-directed
mutagenesis
studies
and
employed
this
pocket
in
a
virtual
screen
for
small-molecule
modulators
of
SERT
function
.

In
functional
transport
assays
,
we
found
that
one
of
the
identified
molecules
,
ATM7
,
increased
the
reuptake
of
serotonin
,
possibly
by
facilitating
the
interaction
of
serotonin
with
transport-ready
conformations
of
SERT
when
concentrations
of
serotonin
were
low
and
rate
limiting
.

In
addition
,
ATM7
potentiates
3
,
4-methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine
(
MDMA
,
"Ecstasy"
)
-induced
reversed
transport
by
SERT
.

Taking
advantage
of
a
conformationally
sensitive
residue
in
transmembrane
domain
6
,
we
demonstrate
that
ATM7
mechanistically
stabilizes
an
outward-facing
conformation
of
SERT
.

Taken
together
these
observations
demonstrate
that
ATM7
acts
through
a
novel
mechanism
that
involves
allosteric
modulation
of
SERT
function
.

Lorglumide
is
therefore
a

For

Cisplatin-induced
nephrotoxicity
is
an
important
limiting
factor
for
cisplatin
use
.

Tumor
necrosis
factor-α
(
TNF-α
)
is
known
to
contribute
to
cisplatin-induced
nephrotoxicity
by
inducing
an
inflammatory
process
aggravating
the
primary
injury
,
thereby
resulting
in
acute
kidney
injury
(
AKI
)
.

The
present
study
investigates
the
pathways
synergistically
activated
by
cisplatin
and
TNF-α
responsible
for
TNF-α-enhanced
cisplatin-induced
renal
cell
injury
.

To
do
so
,
immortalized
renal
proximal
tubular
epithelial
cells
(
IM-PTECs
)
were
co-treated
with
TNF-α
and
cisplatin
.

Under
these
conditions
,
cisplatin
induced
dose-dependent
apoptosis
in
IM-PTECs
,
which
was
significantly
enhanced
by
TNF-α
.

Transcriptomic
analysis
revealed
that
cisplatin
inhibited
the
typical
TNF-α
response
and
cisplatin
/
TNF-α
treatment
up-regulated
cell
death
pathways
while
it
down-regulated
survival
pathways
compared
to
cisplatin
alone
.

In
concordance
,
the
gene
expression
levels
of
kidney
injury
markers
combined
with
activation
of
specific
inflammatory
mediators
were
enhanced
by
cisplatin
/
TNF-α
treatment
,
resembling
the
in
vivo
cisplatin-induced
nephrotoxicity
response
.

Furthermore
,
combined
cisplatin
/
TNF-α
treatment
inhibited
NF-κB
nuclear
translocation
and
NF-κB-mediated
gene
transcription
leading
to
enhanced
and
prolonged
JNK
and
c-Jun
phosphorylation
.

JNK
sustained
activation
further
inhibited
NF-κB
signaling
via
a
feedback
loop
mechanism
.

This
led
to
an
alteration
in
the
transcription
of
the
NF-κB-induced
anti-apoptotic
genes
c-IAP2
,
Bcl-XL
,
Bruce
and
Bcl2
and
pro-apoptotic
genes
Bfk
and
Xaf1
and
consequently
to
sensitization
of
the
IM-PTECs
toward
cisplatin
/
TNF-α-induced
toxicity
.

In
conclusion
,
our
findings
support
a
model
whereby
renal
cells
exposed
to
both
cisplatin
and
TNF-α
switch
into
a
more
pro-apoptotic
and
inflammatory
program

altering
their

OBJECTIVE
:
ADP
plays
an
important
role
in
platelet
aggregation
by
activating
P2Y12
receptors
.

We
assessed
the
hypothesis
that
P2Y12
receptors
are
expressed
in
vascular
smooth
muscle
cells
(
VSMC
)
.

METHODS
AND
RESULTS
:
P2Y12
receptor
mRNA
was
found
to
have
a
high
expression
among
the
P2
receptors
in
human
VSMC
,
significantly
higher
than
the
other
2
ADP
receptors
(
P2Y1
and
P2Y13
,
real-time
polymerase
chain
reaction
)
.

Western
blots
gave
a
band
of
50
kD
,
similar
to
that
in

To
unmask

were
precontracted

.

The
selective
P2Y12
antagonist
AR-C67085
blocked
2-MeSADP
contractions
.

The
contraction
was
not
reduced
in
patients
using
clopidogrel
,
a
drug
inhibiting
ADP-induced
platelet
aggregation
by
blocking
the
P2Y12
receptor
.

This
may
be
explained
by
the
high
instability
of
the
active
clopidogrel
metabolite
that
never
reaches
the
systemic
circulation
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
ADP
acting
on
P2Y12
receptors
not
only
is
important
for
platelet
activation
but
also
stimulates
vasoconstriction
.

Stable
drugs
with
antagonistic
effects
on
P2Y12
receptors
,
affecting
both
platelets
and
VSMC
,
could
be
of
double
therapeutic
benefit
in
their
prevention
of
both
thrombosis
and
vasospasm

Human
CYP3A
is
the
most
abundant
P450
isozyme
present
in
the
human
liver
and
small
intestine
,
and
metabolizes
around
50%
of
medical
drugs
on
the
market
.

The
human
CYP3A
subfamily
comprises
four
members
(
CYP3A4
,
CYP3A5
,
CYP3A7
,
CYP3A43
)
encoded
on
human
chromosome
7
.

However
,
transgenic
mouse
lines
carrying
the
entire
human
CYP3A
cluster
have
not
been
constructed
because
of
limitations
in
conventional
cloning
techniques
.

Here
,
we
show
that
the
introduction
of
a
human
artificial
chromosome
(
HAC
)
containing
the
entire
genomic
human
CYP3A
locus
recapitulates
tissue-
and
stage-specific
expression
of
human
CYP3A
genes
and
xenobiotic
metabolism
in
mice
.

About
700
kb
of
the
entire
CYP3A
genomic
segment
was
cloned
into
a
HAC
(
CYP3A-HAC
)
,
and
trans-chromosomic
(
Tc
)
mice
carrying
a
single
copy
of
germline-transmittable
CYP3A-HAC
were
generated
via
a
chromosome-engineering
technique
.

The
tissue-
and
stage-specific
expression
profiles
of
CYP3A
genes
were
consistent
with
those
seen
in
humans
.

We
further
generated
mice
carrying
the
CYP3A-HAC
in
the
background
homozygous
for
targeted
deletion
of
most
endogenous
Cyp3a
genes
.

In
this
mouse
strain
with
'fully
humanized'
CYP3A
genes
,
the
kinetics
of
triazolam
metabolism
,
CYP3A-mediated
mechanism-based
inactivation
effects
and
formation
of
fetal-specific
metabolites
of
dehydroepiandrosterone
observed
in
humans
were
well
reproduced
.

Thus
,
these
mice
are
likely
to
be
valuable
in
evaluating
novel
drugs
metabolized
by
CYP3A
enzymes
and
in
studying
the
regulation
of
human
CYP3A
gene
expression
.

Furthermore
,
this
system
can
also
be
used
for
generating
Tc
mice
carrying

metabolic
genes

This
short

has

that
map
to

of

protein
.

This
article
discusses
the
detailed
kinetic
characterization
of
MjAdSS

degrees

,
suggest
a

AdSS
are
known
to
exhibit
monomer-dimer
equilibrium
with
the
dimer
being
implicated
in
catalysis
.

In
contrast
,
our
studies
show
that
MjAdSS
is
an
equilibrium
mixture
of
dimers
and
tetramers
with
the
tetramer
being
the
catalytically
active
form
.

The
tetramer
dissociates
into
dimers
with
a
minor
increase
in

The
medial
prefrontal
cortex
(
mPFC
)
has
been
implicated
in
modulating
anxiety
.

However
,
it
is
unknown
whether
excitatory
or
inhibitory
neurotransmission
in
the
infralimbic
(
IL
)
subregion
of
the
mPFC
underlies
the
pathology
of
anxiety-related
behavior
.

To
address
this
issue
,
we
infused
the
GABAA
receptor
(
GABAAR
)
antagonist
bicuculline
to
temporarily
activate
the
IL
cortex
.

IL
cortex
activation
decreased
the
time
spent
in
the
center
area
in
the
open
field
test
,
decreased
exploration
of
the
open-arms
in
the
elevated
plus
maze
test
,
and
increased
the
latency
to
bite
food
in
the
novelty-suppressed
feeding
test
.

These
findings
substantiate
the
GABAergic
system's
role
in
anxiety-related
behaviors
.

IL
cortex
inactivation
with
the
AMPA
receptor
(
AMPAR
)
antagonist
CNQX
produced
opposite
,
anxiolytic
effects
.

However
,
infusion
of
the
NMDA
receptor
(
NMDAR
)
antagonist
AP5
into
the
IL
cortex
had
no
significant
effect
.

Additionally
,
we
did
not
observe
motor
activity
deficits
or
appetite
deficits
following
inhibition
of
GABAergic
or
glutamatergic
neurotransmission
.

Interestingly
,
we
found
parallel
and
corresponding
electrophysiological
changes
in
anxious
mice;
compared
to
mice
with
relatively
low
anxiety
,
the
relatively
high
anxiety
mice
exhibited
smaller
evoked
inhibitory
postsynaptic
currents
(
eIPSCs
)
and
larger
AMPA-mediated
evoked
excitatory
postsynaptic
currents
(
eEPSCs
)
in
pyramidal
neurons
in
the
IL
cortex
.

The
changes
of
eIPSCs
and
eEPSCs
were
due
to
presynaptic
mechanisms
.

Our
results
suggest
that
imbalances
of
neurotransmission
in
the
IL
cortex
may
cause
a
net
increase
in
excitatory
inputs
onto
pyramidal
neurons
,
which
may
underlie
the
pathogenic
mechanism
of
anxiety
disorders

Factor
VIII
(
FVIII
)
and
factor
V
(
FV
)
are
homologous
coagulation
cofactors
sharing
a
similar
domain
organization
(
A1-A2-B-A3-C1-C2
)
and
are
both
extensively
glycosylated

their
B-domains
.

In
mammalian
cell
expression
systems
,
compared
with
FV
,
the
FVIII
primary
translation
product
is
inefficiently
transported
out
of
the
endoplasmic
reticulum
.

Here
we
show
that
FVIII
is
degraded
within
the
cell
by
a
lactacystin-inhibitable
pathway
,
implicating
the
cytosolic
20
S
proteasome
machinery
.

Protein
chaperones
calnexin
(
CNX
)
and
calreticulin
(
CRT
)
preferentially
interact
with
glycoproteins
containing
monoglucosylated
N-linked
oligosaccharides
and
are
proposed
to
traffic
proteins
through
degradative
and
/
or
secretory
pathways
.

Utilizing
co-immunoprecipitation
assays
,
intracellular
FVIII
was
detected
in
association
with
CNX
maximally
within
30
min
to
1
h
following
synthesis
,
whereas
FV
could
not
be
detected
in
association
with
CNX
.

In
contrast
,
both
FVIII
and
FV
displayed
interaction
with
CRT
during
transit
through
the
secretory
pathway
.

B-domain
deleted
FVIII
significantly
reduced
the
CNX
and
CRT
interaction
,
indicating
the
B-domain
may
represent
a
primary
CNX
and
CRT
interaction
site
.

In
the
presence
of
inhibitors
of
glucose
trimming
,
the
interactions
of
FVIII
with
CNX
,
and
of
FVIII
and
FV
with
CRT
,
were
significantly
reduced
whereas
the
secretion
of
FVIII
,
and
not
FV
,
was
inhibited
.

In
addition
,
transfection
in
a
glucosidase
I-deficient
Chinese
hamster
ovary
cell
line
(
Lec23
)
demonstrated
that
both
degradation
and
secretion
of
FVIII
were
inhibited
,
with
little
effect
on
the
secretion
of
FV
.

These
results
support
that
CNX
and
CRT
binding
,
mediated
at
least
in
part
by
the
B-domain
of
FVIII
,
is
required
for
efficient
FVIII
degradation
and
secretion
.

In
contrast
,
FV
does
not
require
CNX
interaction
for
efficient
secretion
.

The
results
suggest
a
unique
requirement
for
carbohydrate
processing
and
molecular
chaperone
interactions
that
may
limit
the
productive
secretion
of
FVIII
.

Growth
factor
receptor-bound
protein
10
(
Grb10
)
is
a
Src
homology
2
(

)
domain-containing
protein
and
one
of
the
binding
partners
for
several
trans-membrane
tyrosine-kinase
receptors
,
including
insulin
receptor
(
IR
)
and
insulin-like
growth
factor-1
receptor
(
IGF1-R
)
.

The
hippocampus
,
which
is
critical
for
cognitive
functions
,
is
one
of
the
main
distribution
areas
of
Grb10
in
the
central
nervous
system
.

In
recent
years
,
diabetic
encephalopathy
has
been
defined
as
a
third
type
of
diabetes
and
the
IGF1-IR
pathway
has
been
shown
to
be
critical
for
the
neuropathogenic
process
of
cognitive
disorder
in
diabetes
.

However
,
the
role
of
endogenous
Grb10
in
regulating
the
IGF1-IR
pathway
and
neurobehavioral
changes
is
not
explicit
.

The
objective
of
this
study
was
to
determine
the
in
vivo
function
of
endogenous
Grb10
in
diabetic
encephalopathy
and
the
underlying
mechanisms
.

Using
stereotaxic
surgical
techniques
and
lentiviral
vectors
expressing
specific
short
hairpin
RNA
(
shRNA
)
,
we
could
steadily
knock
down
Grb10
expression
in
the
hippocampus
.

More
importantly
,
we
demonstrated
that
hippocampus-specific
modulation
of
Grb10
protein
levels
led
to
a
prominent
remission
of
cognitive
disorder
,
including
improvements
in
both
ultrastructural
pathology
and
abnormal
neurobehavioural
changes
.

Our
findings
indicate
that
endogenous
overexpression
of
Grb10
functions
as
a
suppressor
of
the
IGF1-IR
pathway
,
which
may
represent
an
important
mechanism
that
regulates
cognitive
disorder
in
diabetes
.

Many
members
of
the
nudix
hydrolase
family
exhibit
considerable
substrate
multispecificity
and
ambiguity
,
which
raises
significant
issues
when
assessing
their
functions
in
vivo
and
gives
rise
to
errors
in
database
annotation
.

Several
display
low
antimutator
activity
when
expressed
in
bacterial
tester
strains
as
well
as
some
degree
of
activity
in
vitro
towards
mutagenic
,
oxidized
nucleotides
such
as
8-oxo-dGTP
.

However
,
many
of
these
show
greater
activity
towards
other
nucleotides
such
as
ADP-ribose
or
diadenosine
tetraphosphate
(
Ap
(
4
)
A
)
.

The
antimutator
activities
have
tended
to
gain
prominence
in
the
literature
,
whereas
they
may
in
fact
represent
the
residual
activity
of
an
ancestral
antimutator
enzyme
that
has
become
secondary
to
the
more
recently
evolved
major
activity
after
gene
duplication
.

Whether
any
meaningful
antimutagenic
function
has
also
been
retained
in
vivo
requires
very
careful
assessment
.

Then
again
,
other
examples
of
substrate
ambiguity
may
indicate
as
yet
unexplored
regulatory
systems
.

For
example
,
bacterial

hydrolases
also
efficiently
remove
pyrophosphate
from
the

of

,
suggesting
a
potential
role
for
Ap
(
4
)
A
in
the
control
of
bacterial
mRNA
turnover
,
while
the
ability
of
some
eukaryotic
mRNA
decapping
enzymes
to
degrade
IDP
and
dIDP
or
diphosphoinositol
polyphosphates
(
DIPs
)
may
also
be
indicative
of
new
regulatory
networks
in
RNA
metabolism
.

DIP
phosphohydrolases
also
degrade
diadenosine
polyphosphates
and
inorganic
polyphosphates
,
suggesting
further
avenues
for
investigation
.

This

uses
these
and
other
examples
to
highlight
the
need
for
a
greater
awareness
of
the
possible
significance
of
substrate
ambiguity
among
the

,
in

more

than

Following

both

but

(

-tacrine
exhibited
higher

Tissue-type
plasminogen
activator
(
tPA
)
,
a
serine
protease
well
known
for
generating
plasmin
,
has
been
demonstrated
to
induce
matrix
metalloproteinase-9
(
MMP-9
)
gene
expression
and
protein
secretion
in
renal
interstitial
fibroblasts
.

However
,
exactly
how
tPA
transduces
its
signal
into
the
nucleus
to
control
gene
expression
is
unknown
.

This
study
investigated
the
mechanism
by
which
tPA
induces
MMP-9
gene
expression
.

Both
wild-type
and
non-enzymatic
mutant
tPA
were
found
to
induce
MMP-9
expression
in
rat
kidney
interstitial
fibroblasts
(
NRK-49F
)
,
indicating
that
the
actions
of
tPA
are
independent
of
its
proteolytic
activity
.

tPA
bound
to
the
low
density
lipoprotein
receptor-related
protein-1
(
LRP-1
)
in
NRK-49F
cells
,
and
this
binding
was
competitively
abrogated
by
the
LRP-1
antagonist
,
the
receptor-associated
protein
.

In
mouse
embryonic
fibroblasts
(
PEA-13
)
lacking
LRP-1
,
tPA
failed
to
induce
MMP-9
expression
.

Furthermore
,
tPA
induced
rapid
tyrosine
phosphorylation
on
the
beta
subunit
of
LRP-1
,
which
was
followed
by
the
activation
of
Mek1
and
its
downstream
Erk-1
and
-2
.

Blockade
of
Erk-1
/
2
activation
by
the
Mek1
inhibitor
abolished
MMP-9
induction
by
tPA
in
NRK-49F
cells
.

Conversely
,
overexpression
of
constitutively
activated
Mek1
induced
Erk-1
/
2
phosphorylation
and
MMP-9
expression
.

In
mouse
obstructed
kidney
,
tPA
,
LRP-1
,
and
MMP-9
were
concomitantly
induced
in
the
renal
interstitium
.

Collectively
,
these
results
suggest
that
besides
its
classical
proteolytic
activity
,
tPA
acts
as
a
cytokine
that
binds
to
the
cell
membrane
receptor
LRP-1
,
induces
its
tyrosine
phosphorylation
,
and
triggers
intracellular
signal
transduction
,

Leydig

We
present
two
cases
in
which
patients
had
increased
blood
levels
of
testosterone
and
frank
hirsutism
.

Imaging
showed
minimal
abnormalities
.

After
adrenal
disease
had
been
ruled
out
,
they
underwent
a
bilateral

.

One
case
showed
a
Leydig

,
the
other
a

tumour
should

Adrenal
disease
with

hypersecretion
can
be
suspected

Although
DHEAS
has
a
good
sensitivity
in
the
detection
of
adrenal
origin
of
hyperandrogenism
(
and
hence
a
good
negative
predictive
value
)
it
is
not
specific
(
specificity
ranging
from
85
to
98%
)
.

Imaging
of
the
ovaries
can
be
helpful
but
does
not
rule
out
ovarian
disease
if
normal
.

Indeed
,
diffuse
stromal
Leydig

Leydig
cell
tumours
(
usually
small
)
may
escape
imaging
and
in
some

can
only
be
made
on
pathology
.

As
these

characterized
by

.

Approximately

Subcellular

revealed
that
,
as
in

,
the
expressed
wild-type
human
AGT1
was
predominantly
localized
in
mouse
hepatocellular

,
whereas
the
most
common
mutant
form

was
localized
predominantly
in

Due
to
its
production
of
potent

including
hypochlorous
acid
,
human
myeloperoxidase

plays
a
critical
role
in

.

Thus
MPO
is
an
attractive
target
in

design
.

(

were
detected
to
be
very
potent
MPO

however
,
they
also
promote
inhibition
of
the

)
at

range
.

Via

design
,
a

derived
from

were
synthesized
and
their
effects
were
assessed
on

,
whereas
its

was
in

X-chromosomal
dystonia
parkinsonism
syndrome
(
XDP
,
'lubag'
)
is
associated
with
sequence
changes
within
the
TAF1
/
DYT3
multiple
transcript
system
.

Although
most
sequence
changes
are
intronic
,
one
,
disease-specific
single-nucleotide
change
3
(
DSC3
)
,
is
located
within
an
exon
(
d4
)
.

Transcribed
exon
d4
occurs
as
part
of
multiple
splice
variants
.

These
variants
include
exons
d3
and
d4
spliced
to
exons
of
TAF1
,
and
an
independent
transcript
composed
of
exons
d2-d4
.

Location
of
DSC3
in
exon
d4
and
utilization
of
this
exon
in
multiple
splice
variants
suggest
an
important
role
of
DSC3
in
the
XDP
pathogenesis
.

To
test
this
hypothesis
,
we
transfected
neuroblastoma
cells
with
four
expression
constructs
,
including
exons
d2-d4
[
d2-d4

wild-type
(

]
and
d3-d4
(
d3-d4

wt
and
d3-d4
/

)
.

Expression
profiling
revealed
a
dramatic
effect
of
DSC3
on
overall
gene
expression
.

Three
hundred
and
sixty-two
genes
differed
between
cells
containing
d2-d4
/
wt
and
d2-d4

.

Annotation

revealed
enrichment
of
genes
related
to
vesicular

,
dopamine
metabolism
,
synapse

,
Ca

metabolism
and
oxidative
stress
.

Two
hundred
and
eleven
genes
were
differentially
expressed
in
d3-d4
/
wt
versus
d3-d4
/
DSC3
.

Annotation
clustering
highlighted
genes
in
signal

and
cell-cell
interaction
.

The
data
show
an
important
role
of
physiologically
occurring
transcript
d2-d4
in
normal
brain
function
.

Interference
with
this
role
by
DSC3
is
a
likely
pathological
mechanism
in
XDP
.

Disturbance
of
dopamine
function
and
of
Ca
(
2

metabolism
can
explain
abnormal
movement;
loss
of
protection
against
reactive
oxygen
species
may
account
for
the
neurodegenerative
changes
in
XDP
.

Although
d3-d4
also
affect
genes
potentially
related
to
neurodegenerative
processes
,
their
physiologic
role
as
splice

of
TAF1
awaits

Lead
is
a
ubiquitous
environmental
toxin
that
is
capable
of
causing
numerous
acute
and
chronic
illnesses
.

Human
and
animal
exposure
demonstrates
that
lead
is
nephrotoxic
.

However
,
attempts
to
reduce
lead-induced
nephrotoxicity
were
not
found
suitable
for

Recently
,
flaxseed

,
a

lignans
,
has
been
shown
to
prevent

reduce
the
progression
of
certain
types

.

In

of
this
,
the
present
study
investigates
the
protective
effect
of
FXO
on

-induced

Rats
were
pre-fed

14
days
,
and
then
,
four
doses
of
lead

(
25
mg

weight
)
were
administered
intraperitoneally
while
still
on
diet
.

Various

,
and

were
analyzed
in

.

PbAc
nephrotoxicity
was
characterized
by
increased
serum
creatinine
and
blood
urea
nitrogen
.

PbAc
increased
the
activities
of
lactate

and
NADP-malic
enzyme
,
whereas
it
decreased
malate
and
glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase
,
glucose-6-phosphatase
,

,
and
BBM
enzyme
activities
.

PbAc
caused
oxidant

imbalances
as
reflected
by
increased
lipid
peroxidation
and
decreased
activities
of
superoxide

In
contrast
,
FXO
alone
enhanced
the
enzyme

.

FXO
feeding
to

In

,
dietary
FXO

ameliorated
PbAc-induced

In
this
study
,
the
stabilization

of
three
polymers
on
four
model
drugs
(
felodipine
,
fenofibrate
,
carbamazepine
,
and
celecoxib
)
under
saturated
humidity
were
investigated
.

Three
different
types
of
thin
films
(
solid
dispersions
,
drug
films
with
a
polymer
film
coating
and
drug
films
laid
on
top
of
polymer
coated
surfaces
)
were
prepared
and
compared
with
films
containing
the
drug
alone
.

ATR-FTIR
spectroscopy
,
polarised
light
microscopy
(
PLM
)
,
scanning
electron

(
SEM
)
and
nano-thermal
analysis
(
nano-TA
)
were
performed
on
the
model
systems
after
storage
under
saturated
humidity
.

The
recrystallisation
tendency
of
the
drug
in
the
drug
containing
thin
films
was
found
to
be
strongly
related
to
the
intrinsic
crystallization
tendency
of
the
drug
film
alone
and
the
strength
of
drug-polymer
interactions
.

Additionally
,
under
high
humidity
,
the
glass
transition
temperature
of
the
polymer
is
no
longer
an
indicator
of
its
drug
stabilization
capability
.

Instead
,
it
is
the
hygroscobicity
of
the
polymer
that
appears
to
be
the
most
important
parameter
.

Amongst
the
polymers
tested
in
this
study
,
EUDRAGIT
E
PO
was
found
to
have
the
greatest
inhibitory
effect
on
crystallization
,
whilst
PVP
K30
was
found
to
have
the
least
protective
effect;
presumably
because
of
its
hygroscopic
nature
.
6-Hydroxydopamine
(
6-OHDA
)
is
a
neurotoxin
that
generates
an
experimental
model
of
Parkinson's
disease
in
rodents
and
is
commonly
employed
to
induce
a
lesion
in
dopaminergic
pathways
.

The
characterization
of
those
molecular
mechanisms
linked
to
6-OHDA-induced
early
toxicity
is
needed
to
better
understand
the
cellular
events
further
leading
to
neurodegeneration
.

The
present
work
explored
how
6-OHDA
triggers
early
downstream
signaling
pathways
that
activate
neurotoxicity
in
the
rat
striatum
.

Mitochondrial
function
,
caspases-dependent
apoptosis
,
kinases
signaling
(
Akt
,
ERK

,
SAP

)
and
crosstalk
between
nuclear
factor
kappa
B
(
NF-κB
)
and
nuclear
factor-erythroid-2-related
factor
2
(
Nrf2
)
were
evaluated
at
early
times
post-lesion
.

We
found
that
6-OHDA
initiates
cell
damage
via
mitochondrial
complex
I
inhibition
,
cytochrome
c
and
apoptosis-inducing
factor
(
AIF
)
release
,
as
well
as
activation
of
caspases
9
and
3
to
induce
apoptosis
,
kinase
signaling
modulation
and
NF-κB-mediated
inflammatory
responses
,
accompanied
by
inhibition
of
antioxidant
systems
regulated
by
the
Nrf2
pathway
.

Our
results
suggest
that
kinases
SAP
/
JNK
and
p38
up-regulation
may
play
a
role
in
the
early
stages
of
6-OHDA
toxicity
to
trigger
intrinsic
pathways
for
apoptosis
and
enhanced
NF-κB
activation
.

In
turn
,
these
cellular
events
inhibit
the
activation
of
cytoprotective
mechanisms
,
thereby
leading
to
a
condition
of
general
damage

substituted
at
N
(

with
methyl
,
hydroxymethyl
,
formyl
and
acetyl
groups

occurs
at
a
position
critical
to
the
redox

We

,
depending

were

(

activity
on
muscarinic
receptor
agonist-
and
histamine-induced

Bovine
tracheal

strips
were
incubated
with

microM
fenoterol
or

for
various
periods
of
time
(
5
,
30
min
,
18
h
)
at
37
degrees
C
.

After
extensive
washout
(
3
h
,
37
degrees
C
)
,
isometric
contractions
were
measured
to
the
full
muscarinic

agonist
methacholine
,
the
partial
muscarinic
receptor
agonist
4-
(
m-chlorophenyl-carbamoyloxy
)
-2-butynyltrimethylammonium
(
McN-A-343
)
and
histamine
.

Fenoterol
treatment
significantly
reduced
the
sensitivity
(
pEC
(
50
)
)
to
methacholine
in
a
time-dependent
manner
,
without
affecting
maximal
contraction
(
E
(
max
)
)
.

Fenoterol
treatment
similarly
reduced
the
pEC
(
50
)
of
McN-A-343
and
histamine;
however
,
E
(
max
)
values
were
also
reduced
,
to
approximately
70%
of
control
after
18-h
treatment
.

The
inverse
agonist
timolol
,
having
no
effect
on
control
preparations
,
consistently
restored
the
reduced
pEC
(
50
)
and
E
(
max
)
values
of
the
contractile
agonists
.

Remarkably
,
in
the
presence
of
timolol
the
pEC
(
50
)
values
of
McN-A-343
and
histamine
in
fenoterol-treated
airways
were
significantly
enhanced
compared
to
controls
.

In
conclusion
,
fenoterol-induced
constitutive
beta
(
2
)
-adrenoceptor
activity
reduces
muscarinic
receptor
agonist-
and
histamine-induced
contractions
of
bovine
tracheal

,
which
can
be
reversed
by
the
inverse
agonist
timolol
.

Moreover
,
after
beta
(
2
)
-adrenoceptor
agonist
treatment
,
inverse
agonism
by
beta-adrenoceptor
antagonists
may
cause
enhanced

The

,
one
of
which
theoretically

.

The

of
the

,
revealed
by
SDS-PAGE
,
was
approximately
27
kDa
.

The

,
was

The

Gliomas

High
grade
glioma
cells
possess
a
voltage-independent
,
amiloride-inhibitable
,
inward
Na
+
current
.

This
current
does
not
exist
in
normal
astrocytes
or
low
grade
tumor
cells
.

Inhibition
of
this
conductance
decreases
glioma
growth
and
cell
migration
making
it
a
potential
therapeutic
target
.

Our
previous
results
have
shown
that
the
acid-sensing
ion
channels
(
ASICs
)
,
members
of
the
epithelial
Na
+
channel
(
ENaC
)
/
degenerin
(
DEG
)
family
of
ion
channels
are
part
of
this
current
pathway
.

We
hypothesized
that
one
member
of
the
ENaC
/
DEG
family
,
ASIC2
,
is
retained
intracellularly
and
that
it
is
the
lack
of
functional
expression
of
ASIC2
at
the
cell
surface
that
results
in
hyperactivity
of
this
conductance
in
high
grade
gliomas
.

In
this
study
we
show
that
the
chemical
chaperone
,
glycerol
,
and
the
transcriptional
regulator
,
sodium
4-phenylbutyrate
,
inhibit
the
constitutively
activated
inward
current
and
reduce
cell
growth
and
migration
in
glioblastoma
multiforme
.

The
results
suggest
that
these
compounds
induce
the
movement
of
ASIC2
to
the
plasma
membrane
,
and
once
there
,
the
basally
active
inward
current
characteristic
of
glioma
cells
is
abolished
by
inherent
negative
regulatory
mechanisms
.

This
in
turn
compromises
the
ability
of
the
glioma
cell
to
migrate
and
proliferate
.

These
results
support
the
hypothesis
that
the
conductance
pathway
in
high
grade
glioma
cells
is
comprised
of
ENaC
/
DEG
subunits
and
that
abolishing
this
channel
activity
promotes
a
reversion
of
a
high
grade
glioma
cell
to
a
phenotype
resembling
that
of
normal

Alzheimer's
disease
(
AD
)
is
a
progressive
neurodegenerative
disorder
that
is
characterized
by
progressive
loss
of
memory
and
cognitive
impairment
.

Aggregation
of
amyloid-β
(
Aβ
)
peptides
is
the
crucial
factor
in
the
onset
of
AD
.

The
toxic
Aβ
peptides
Aβ40
and
Aβ42
are
produced
from
the
Aβ
precursor
protein
(
APP
)
,
a
transmembrane
protein
which
is
folded
and
modified
in
endoplasmic
reticulum
(
ER
)
.

ER
is
the
main
organelle
for
the
synthesis
and
processing
of
nearly
all
proteins
as
well
as
the
main
cellular
source
of
Ca2
+
.

Under
stress
conditions
,
three
main
ER
pathways
including
inositol-requiring
enzyme

,
protein
kinase
RNA-like
ER
kinase
,
and
activating
transcription
factor
6
become
activated
causing
the
accumulation
of
unfolded
or
misfolded
proteins
within
ER
lumen
.

These
pathways
manage
the
stress
by
regulating
the
expression
of
chaperones
and
enzymes
involved
in
protein
folding
.

Several
studies
have
reported
the
dysfunction
of
these
stress-sensing
pathways
in
pathological
conditions
,
including
neurodegenerative
diseases
.

Recent
studies
have
proposed
that
neuronal
death
in
AD
arises
from
dysfunction
of
the
ER
.

Here
,
we
will
review
recent
research
findings
on
the
interaction
between
ER
and
mitochondria
,
and
its
effect
on
apoptotic
pathways
.

We
further
provide
insights
into
studies
which
suggest
the
role
of
ER
in
animal
and
/
or
cellular
models
of
AD
.

Therapeutic
strategies
that
modulate
ER
could
represent
a

Fat
infiltration
within
muscle
is
one
of
a
number
of
features
of
vitamin
D
deficiency
,
which
leads
to
a
decline
in
muscle
functionality
.

The
origin
of
this
fat
is
unclear
,
but
one
possibility
is
that
it
forms
from
myogenic
precursor
cells
present
in
the
muscle
,
which
transdifferentiate
into
mature
adipocytes
.

The
current

examined
the
effect

,
on
the
capacity
of

for
up
to
6

and
markers
of

measured
.

Mature
myofibres
were
formed
in
both
adipogenic
and
myogenic
media
,
but
fat
droplets
were
only
observed
in
adipogenic
media
.

Relative
to

,
low
physiological
concentrations
(
10⁻¹³
and
10⁻¹¹
M
)
of
1
,
25

increased
fat
droplet

,
whereas
high
physiological
(
10⁻⁹
M
)
and
supraphysiological
concentrations
(
≥10⁻⁷
M
)
inhibited
fat
accumulation
.

This
increased
accumulation
of
fat
with
low
physiological
concentrations
(
10⁻¹³
and
10⁻¹¹
M
)
was
associated
with
a
sequential
up-regulation
of
PPARγ2
(
PPARG
)
and
FABP4
mRNA
,
indicating
formation
of
adipocytes
,
whereas
higher
concentrations
(
≥10⁻⁹
M
)
reduced
all
these
effects
,
and
the
highest
concentration
(
10⁻⁵
M
)
appeared
to
have
toxic
effects
.

This
is
the
first
study
to
demonstrate
dose-dependent
effects
of

₂D₃
on
the
transdifferentiation
of

Low
physiological
concentrations
(
possibly
mimicking
a

However
,
the

This

to
elucidate
the

re-efflux
from

,
the
cells
that
have
the
most

that
stably

,
the
following
results
were
obtained
.

.

Second
,

,
we
found
that
a
new
type
of

-
accounts
for
the
ability
of
these
elements
to
form
hypervalent

compounds
.

Hypervalent
molecules
are
formed
when
it
is
energetically
favorable
for

to
be
recoupled
,
allowing
each

to
form
chemical

.

In

.

We
found
two
significant
differences
between
the
ClFn

series
:
(
i
)
the
bond
dissociation
energies
of
ClFn
(

are
much
weaker
than
those
of
the

Examination
of
the
Mulliken
populations
at
the
HF

SFn
species
predicts
that
the
F
atom
in
the
axial

recoupled

)
position
is
more
highly
charged
than
the
F
atom
in

position;
there
is
also
less
change

the
F
atoms
in
ClFn

than
in

The
positive
charge
on
Cl

makes
it
more
difficult
for
an
F
atom
to
attract
electrons
from
Cl

correspondingly
less

In
the
last
couple
of
decades
fungal
infections
have
become
a
significant
clinical
problem
.

A
major
interest
into
fungal
steroid
action
has
been
provoked
since
research
has
proven
that
steroid
hormones
are
toxic
to
fungi
and
affect
the
host
/
fungus
relationship
.

Steroid
hormones
were
found
to
differ
in
their
antifungal
activity
in
ascomycetous
fungi
Hortaea
werneckii
,
Saccharomyces
cerevisiae
and
Aspergillus
oryzae
.

Dehydroepiandrosterone
was
shown
to
be
the
strongest
inhibitor
of
growth
in
all
three
varieties
of
fungi
followed
by
androstenedione
and
testosterone
.

For
their
protection
,
fungi
use
several
mechanisms
to
lower
the
toxic
effects
of
steroids
.

The
efficiency
of
biotransformation
in
detoxification
depended
on
the
microorganism
and
steroid
substrate
used
.

Biotransformation
was
a
relatively
slow
process
as
it
also
depended
on
the
growth
phase
of
the
fungus
.

In
addition
to
biotransformation
,
steroid
extrusion
out
of
the
cells
contributed
to
the
lowering
of
the
active
intracellular
steroid
concentration
.

Plasma
membrane
Pdr5
transporter
was
found
to
be
the
most
effective
,
followed
by
Snq2

and

transporters
Ybt1
and
Ycf1
.

Proteins
Aus1
and
Dan1
were
not
found
to
be
involved
in
steroid
import
.

The
research
of
possible
targets
of
steroid
hormone
action
in
fungi
suggests
that
steroid
hormones
inhibit
ergosterol
biosynthesis
in
S

,
the
electrophysiological
properties
of
K
+
channels
in
MSC
are
not
well
established
and
little
is
known
about
the
role
of
K
+
channels
in
the
regulation
of
MSC
proliferation
.

We
detected
three
distinct
outward
currents
in
MSC
:
(
i
)
a
delayed
rectifier
current
(
IK
(
DR
)
)
;
(
ii
)
a
Ca2

-activated
K

current
(
IK
(
Ca
)
)
;
and
(
iii
)
a
transient
outward
K
+
current
(
Ito
)
.

All
three
were
present
either
alone
or
in
combination
in
almost
all
cells
(
90%
)
investigated
.

However
,
10%
of
cells
did
not
express
a
functional
current
within
physiological
potentials
.

were
associated
with
IK
(

;
Slo
and
KCNN4
were
associated
with
IK
(
Ca
)
;
and
Kv1
.
4
and

were
associated
with
Ito
.

The
Kv
channel
blockers
amiodarone
,
tetraethylammonium
and
verapamil
,
as
well
as
increased
extracellular
K
+
levels
,
inhibited
proliferation
of
cultured
MSC
.

In
MSC
treated
with
Kv
channel
blockers
or
an
increased
extracellular
concentration
of
K
+
,
the
proportion
of
cells
in
the
S
phase
decreased
significantly
and
the
proportion
of
cells
in
the
G
(
0
)
/
G
(
1
)
phase
tended
to
increase
,
indicating
that
the
cells
were
prevented
from
entering
the
S
phase
of
the
cell
cycle
.

Our
findings
suggest
that
rat
MSC
heterogeneously
express
distinct
types
of
K
+
current
,
of
which
the
voltage-gated
IK
(
DR
)
-like
K

current
is
most
common
.

The
chemoattractant

Th2

receptor
,
a
G
protein-coupled
receptor
that
mediates
chemotaxis
of
inflammatory

in
response
to
prostaglandin
D2
(
PGD2
)
,
is
hypothesized
to
play
a
role
in
Th2-mediated
allergic
disease
.

In
addition
to
PGD2
,
CRTH2
can
be
activated
by
indomethacin
,
a
nonselective
cyclooxygenase
inhibitor
and
widely
used
nonsteroidal

drug
(

)
.

To
evaluate
the
structural
features
that
confer
CRTH2
binding
selectivity
,
structure-activity
relationship
analysis
of
arylacetic
acid

NSAIDs
as
CRTH2
receptor
ligands
was
performed
.

.

The
indomethacin
metabolite
5'-O-desmethyl
indomethacin
(
5'-DMI
)
possessed
binding
affinity
similar
to
indomethacin;
however
,
elimination
of
the
2-methyl
substituent
on
the
indole
ring
resulted
in
a
10-fold
decrease
in
binding
affinity
.

No
binding
was
detected
for
indole
acetic
acid
and
indole
derivatives
such
as
tryptophan
,
serotonin
,
and
5-hydroxy
indole
acetic
acid
,
demonstrating
the
importance
of
the
N-acyl
moiety
of
indomethacin
.

Neutral
derivatives
of
indomethacin
also
failed
to
bind
to
mCRTH2
,
suggesting
that
the
negatively
charged
carboxylate
moiety
participates
in
a
key
ligand-receptor
interaction
.

Despite
similar
binding
affinities
,
NSAID-type
mCRTH2
ligands
exhibited
variable
potencies
as
mCRTH2
agonists
.

Sulindac
sulfide
and
5'-DMI
inhibited
intracellular
cyclic
AMP

)
generation
and
stimulated
cell
migration
comparable
with
indomethacin
.

In
contrast
,
zomepirac
did
not
inhibit
[

]
i
generation
or
stimulate
cell
migration
but
weakly
antagonized
the
effects
of
indomethacin
on
[

i
.

Together
,
these
results
reveal
structural
features
of
arylacetic

NSAIDs
that
may
be
exploited
for
the
development
of

effectively
bind
heparin
only
if
the
acidic
N-terminal

Binding
of
a

makes
a
significant
contribution

Mammalian
cysteine
dioxygenase
(
CDO
)
is
a
non-heme
iron
metalloenzyme
that
catalyzes
the
first
committed
step
in
oxidative
cysteine
catabolism
.

The
active
site
coordination
of
CDO
comprises
a
mononuclear
iron
ligated
by
the
Nepsilon
atoms
of
three
protein-derived
histidines
,
thus
representing
a
new
variant
on
the
2-histidine-1-carboxylate
(
2H1C
)
facial
triad
motif
.

Nitric
oxide
was
used
as
a
spectroscopic
probe
in
investigating
the
order
of
substrate-O2
binding
by
EPR
spectroscopy
.

In
these
experiments
,
CDO
exhibits
an
ordered
binding
of
l-cysteine
prior
to
NO
(
and
presumably
O2
)
similar
to
that
observed
for
the
2H1C
class
of
non-heme
iron
enzymes
.

Moreover
,
the
CDO
active
site
is
essentially
unreactive
toward
NO
in
the
absence
of
substrate
,
suggesting
an
obligate
ordered
binding
of
l-cysteine
prior
to
NO
.

Typically
,
addition
of
NO
to
a
mononuclear
non-heme
iron
center
results
in
the
formation
of
an
{FeNO}7
(
S
=
3
/
2
)
species
characterized
by
an
axial
EPR
spectrum
with
gx
,
gy
,
and
gz
values
of
approximately
4
,
approximately
4
,
and
approximately
2
,
respectively
.

However
,
upon
addition
of
NO
to
CDO
in
the
presence
of
substrate
l-cysteine
,
a
low-spin
{FeNO}7
(
S
=
1
/
2
)
signal
that
accounts
for
approximately
85%
of
the
iron
within
the
enzyme
develops
.

Similar
{FeNO}7
(
S
=
1
/
2
)
EPR
signals
have
been
observed
for
a
variety
of
octahedral
mononuclear
iron-nitrosyl
synthetic
complexes;
however
,
this
type
of
iron-nitrosyl
species
is
not
commonly
observed
for
non-heme
iron
enzymes
.

Substitution
of
l-cysteine
with
isosteric
substrate
analogues
cysteamine
,
3-mercaptopropionic
acid
,
and
propane
thiol
did
not
produce
any
analogous
{FeNO}7
signals
(
S
=
1
/
2
or
3
/
2
)
,
thus
reflecting
the
high
substrate
specificity
of
the
enzyme
observed
by
a
number
of
researchers
.

The
unusual
{FeNO}7
(
S
=
1
/
2
)
electronic
configuration
adopted
by
the
substrate-bound
iron-nitrosyl
CDO
(
termed
{ES-NO}7
)
is
a
result
of
the
bidentate
thiol
/
amine
coordination
of
l-cysteine
in
the
NO-bound
CDO
active
site
.

DFT
computations
were
performed
to
further
characterize
this
species
.

The
DFT-predicted
geometric
parameters
for
{ES-NO}7
are
in
good
agreement
with
the
crystallographically
determined
substrate-bound
active
site
configuration
of
CDO
and
are
consistent
with
known
iron-nitrosyl
model
complexes
.

Moreover
,
the
computed
EPR
parameters
(
g
and
A
values
)
are
in
excellent
agreement
with
experimental
results
for
this
CDO
species
and
those
obtained
from
comparable
synthetic
{FeNO}7
(
S
=
1
/
2
)

complexes

CD74
is
a
type
II
transmembrane
protein
that
can
act
as
a
receptor
for
macrophage
migration
inhibitory
factor
(
MIF
)
and
plays
a
role
in
MIF-regulated
responses
.

We
reported
that
MIF
inhibited
osteoclast
formation
and
MIF
knockout
(
KO
)
mice
had
decreased
bone
mass
.

We
therefore
examined
if
CD74
was
involved
in
the
ability
of
MIF
to
alter
osteoclastogenesis
in
cultured
bone
marrow
(
BM
)
from
wild-type
(
WT
)
and
CD74-deficient
(
KO
)
male
mice
.

We
also
measured
the
bone
phenotype
of
CD74
KO
male
mice
.

Bone
mass
in
the
femur
of
8-week-old
mice
was
measured
by
micro-computed
tomography
and
histomorphometry
.

Bone
marrow
cells
from
CD74
KO
mice
formed
15%
more
osteoclast-like
cells
(
OCLs
)
with
macrophage
colony-stimulating
factor
(
M-CSF
)
and
receptor
activator
of
NF-κB
ligand
(
RANKL
)
(
both
at
30
ng
/
mL
)
compared
to
WT
.

Addition
of
MIF
to
WT
cultures
inhibited
OCL
formation
by
16%
but
had
no
effect
on
CD74KO
cultures
.

The
number
of
colony
forming
unit
granulocyte-macrophage
(
CFU-GM
)
in
the
bone
marrow
of
CD74
KO
mice
was
26%
greater
than
in
WT
controls
.

Trabecular
bone
volume
(
TBV
)
in
the
femurs
of
CD74
KO
male
mice
was
decreased
by
26%
compared
to
WT
.

In
addition
,
cortical
area
and
thickness
were
decreased
by
14%
and
11%
,
respectively
.

Histomorphometric
analysis
demonstrated
that
tartrate-resistant
acid
phosphatase
(
TRAP
)
(
+
)
osteoclast
number
and
area
were
significantly
increased
in
CD74
KO
by
35%
and
43%
,
respectively
compared
to
WT
.

Finally
,
we
examined
the
effect
of
MIF
on
RANKL-induced-signaling
pathways
in
bone
marrow
macrophage
(
BMM
)
cultures
.

MIF
treatment
decreased
RANKL-induced
nuclear
factor
of
activated
T
cells
,
cytoplasmic
1
(
NFATc1
)
and
c-Fos
protein
in
BMM
cultures
by
70%
and
41%
,
respectively
.

Our
data
demonstrate
that
CD74
is
required
for
MIF
to
affect
in
vitro
osteoclastogenesis
.

Further
,
the
bone
phenotype
of
CD74
KO
mice
is
similar
to
that
of
MIF
KO
mice
.

MIF
treatment
of
WT
cultures
suppressed
RANKL-induced
activator
protein
1
(
AP-1
)
expression
,
which
resulted
in
decreased
osteoclast
differentiation
in
vitro
.

We
propose
that
CD74
plays
a
critical
role
in
the
MIF
inhibition
of
osteoclastogenesis
.
BACKGROUND
:
The
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
examine
the
utility
of
remnant
uptake
on
postoperative
radioiodine
scans
as
an
oncologic
indicator
after
thyroidectomy
for
differentiated
thyroid
cancer
(
DTC
)
.

METHODS
:
We
conducted
a
retrospective
review
of
patients
undergoing
total
thyroidectomy
for
DTC
and
subsequent
radioactive
iodine
(
RAI
)
treatment
.

Of
the
eight
surgeons
included
,
three
were
considered
high
volume
,
performing
at
least
20
thyroidectomies
per
year
.

Patients
with
distant
metastases
at
diagnosis
or
poorly
differentiated
variants
were
excluded
.

To
control
for
the
effect
of
varying
RAI
doses
,
the
remnant
uptake
was
analyzed
as
a
ratio
of
the
percentage
uptake
to
the
dose
received
(
uptake
to
dose
ratio
,
UDR
)
.

Multivariate
logistic
regression
was
used
to
determine
the
influence
of
UDR
on
recurrence
.

RESULTS
:
Of
the
223
patients
who
met
inclusion
criteria
,
21
patients
(
9
.
42%
)
experienced
a
recurrence
.

Those
who
recurred
had
a
ten-fold
higher
UDR
compared
to
those
who
did
not
recur
(

.

Similarly
,

thyroglobulin
measurements
(
0
.
339
vs
.

,
p<0
.

)
also
had
significantly
greater
UDRs
compared
to
those
with
stable
thyroglobulin
.

The
UDRs
of
high
volume
surgeons
were
significantly
smaller
than
low
volume
surgeons
(
0
.
003
vs
.

0
.
025
,
p

)
.

When
combined
with

was
significantly
associated
with
recurrence
.

High
volume
surgeons
maintained
a
low
level
of
permanent
complications
across
all
UDRs
whereas
low
volume
surgeons
had
greater
permanent
complications
associated
with
higher

biopsy
(
FNAB
)
.

Nine
patients
were
suspected
of
having
papillary
carcinoma
following
cytology
.

The
Sistrunk
operation
(
SO
)
was
performed
in
four
patients
,
SO
with
total
thyroidectomy
(
SO
/
TT
)
was
performed
in
three
patients
,
and
SO
/
TT
with
neck
dissection
was
performed
in
three
patients
.

Six
patients
who
received
total
thyroidectomy
underwent
radioactive
iodine
(
RAI
)
therapy
and
T4
suppression
.

With
a
median
follow-up
period
of
28
.
5
months
,
two
patients
showed
recurrence
and
one
of
them
died
of
the
disease
.

We
analyzed
163
cases
from
1990
to
2012
with
three
or
more
cases
TGDC
carcinoma
,
including
the
present
study
.

Among
48
patients
who
underwent
FNAB
,
75%
had
papillary
thyroid
carcinoma
(
PTC
)
.

SO
,
SO
/
TT
,
or
SO
/
TT
with
neck
dissection
was
performed
in
27%
,
41%
,
and
32%
of
patients
,
respectively
.

Among
119
patients
who
received
total
thyroidectomy
,
36%
had
concomitant
PTC
in
the
thyroid
.

Among
52
patients
who
received
neck
dissection
,
69%
had
cervical
nodal
involvement
.

The
results
of
our
review
suggest
that
when
TGDC
carcinoma
is
suspected
,
ultrasonography
and
,
if
necessary
,
FNAB
should
be
performed
.

If
these
tests
reveal
a
suspected
lesion
in
the
thyroid
or

,
SO

should
be

Arsenic
is
one
of
the
most
hazardous
substances
in
the
environment
known
to
cause
toxicity
in
multiple
organs
.

Cell
adhesion
,
morphological
alterations
,
cell
proliferation
,
terminal
deoxyuridine
triphosphate
nick-end
labeling
(
TUNEL
)
and
caspase-3
/
CPP32
fluorometric
protease
assay
were
important
biomarkers
to
assess
apoptosis
in
cells
.

This
study
aimed
to
evaluate
arsenic-induced
apoptosis
in
the
hepatocytes
of
rat
and
its
protective
efficacy
with
coadministration
of
ascorbic
acid
(
AA
)
and
Pleurotus
florida
lectin
(
PFL
)
individually
.

Results
of
the
present
study
also
showed
that
arsenic
caused
cytotoxicity
by
elevating
morphological
alterations
,
TUNEL-positive
nuclei
,
caspase-3
activity
and
DNA
damage
and
reducing
cell
adhesion
and
cell
proliferation
in
a
time-dependent
manner
.

The
apoptosis
in
hepatocytes
was
reverted
to
normal
value
after
coadministration
of
mushroom
lectin
in
arsenic-exposed
rat
.

The
study
provided
significant
evidence
that
PFL
has
antiapoptotic
property
against
arsenic-induced
toxicity
.

The
beneficial
effect
of
PFL
was
proportional
to
its
duration
of
exposure
.

Retard
activities
of
superoxide
dismutase
and
catalase
,
enhanced
lipid
peroxidation
as
well
as
protein
carbonyl
in
erythrocytes
caused
by
arsenic
could
also
be
maintained
toward
normalcy
by
supplementation
of
AA
and
PFL
.

These
antioxidative
effects
were
exhibited
in
a
time-dependant
manner
.

In
rat
,
treatment
with
AA
and
PFL
prevented
alteration
of
plasma
enzyme
activities
caused
by
arsenic
.

The
results
concluded
that
treatment
with
PFL
has
significant
role
in
protecting
animals
from
arsenic-induced
erythrocytic
damage
.

This
finding
might
be
of
therapeutic
benefit
in
people
suffering
from
chronic
exposure
to
arsenic
from
natural
sources
,
a
global
problem
especially
relevant
to
millions
of
people
on
the
Indian
subcontinent
.
Humans
are
commonly
exposed
to
nicotine
,
one
of
the
most
important
lifestyle
chemicals
.

The
occurrence
of
high
levels
of
arsenic
in
the
groundwater
of
the
southeast
region
of
Asia
has
received
much
attention
in
the
past
decade
and
has
become
a
global
health
concern
.

Predominant
occurrence
of
both
these
chemicals
and
ease
of
their
human
exposure
led
us
to
investigate
the
effect
of
nicotine
,
a
major
tobacco
alkaloid
,
on
arsenic
toxicity
.

Adult
male
rats
were
pre-exposed
to
two
different
doses
of
nicotine
(
0
.
75
and
3
mg
/
kg
,
intraperitoneally
)
for
7
days
followed
by
30
days
of
arsenic
exposure
(
50
ppm
sodium
arsenite
in
drinking
water
)
.

Nicotine
pre-exposure
resulted
in
an
increased
brain
arsenic
accumulation
and
a
decreased
liver
arsenic
concentration
.

Arsenic
also
caused
a
significant
oxidative
stress
in
the
blood
,
brain
and
liver
of
the
exposed
rats
.

Glutathione-S-transferase
,
a
phase
II
enzyme
,
was
inhibited
by
both
arsenic
and
nicotine
but
no
such
inhibition
was
noted
in
arsenic-treated
animals
pre-exposed
to
nicotine
.

Upon
nicotine
pre-exposure
,
brain
acetylcholinesterase
increased
,
while
monoamine
oxidase
(
MAO
)
decreased
.

The
toxic
effects
of
MAO
significantly
attenuated
with
nicotine
pre-exposure
.

The
present
study
suggests
that
nicotine
may
not
be
the
major
contributing
factor
for
the
previously
reported
synergistic
toxic
interaction
between
tobacco
and
arsenic
.

Nicotine
pre-exposure
in
arsenic-exposed
animals
revealed
interesting
toxicokinetics
and
oxidative
stress
modulating
interactions
in
the
brain
and
liver
of
rats
,
which
requires
further
exploration
.
Acetylcholinesterase
(
AChE
)
at
the
neuromuscular
junction
(
NMJ
)
is
anchored
to
the
synaptic
basal
lamina
via
a
triple
helical
collagen
Q
(
ColQ
)
in
the
form
of
asymmetric
AChE
(
AChE
/
ColQ
)
.

The
C-terminal
domain
of
ColQ
binds
to
MuSK
,
the
muscle-specific
receptor
tyrosine
kinase
,
that
mediates
a
signal
for
acetylcholine
receptor
(
AChR
)
clustering
at
the
NMJ
.

ColQ
also
binds
to
heparan
sulfate
proteoglycans
including
perlecan
.

Congenital
defects
of
ColQ
cause
endplate
AChE
deficiency
.

A
single
intravenous
administration
of
adeno-associated
virus
serotype
8
(
AAV8
)
-COLQ
to
Colq-
/
-
mice
rescued
motor
functions
,
synaptic
transmission
,
and
the
ultrastructure
of
NMJ
.

We
also
injected
AAV1-COLQ-IRES-EGFP
to
the
left
tibialis
anterior
and
observed
colocalization
of
AChE
/
ColQ
at
all
the
examined
NMJs
of
the
non-injected
limbs
.

Additionally
,
injection
of
purified
recombinant
AChE
/
ColQ
protein
complex
into
gluteus
maximus
accumulated
AChE
in
non-injected
forelimbs
.

These
observations
suggest
that
the
tissue-targeting
signal
of
ColQ
can
be
exploited
to
specifically
deliver
the
transgene
product
to
the
target
tissue
.

MuSK
antibody-positive
myasthenia
gravis
(
MG
)
accounts
for
5-15%
of
autoimmune
MG
.

As
AChR
deficiency
is
typically
mild
and
as
cholinesterase
inhibitors
are
generally
ineffective
or
worsen
myasthenic
symptoms
,
we
asked
if
the
patient's
MuSK-IgG
interferes
with
binding
of
ColQ
to
MuSK
.

In
vitro
overlay
of
AChE
/
ColQ
to
muscle
sections
of
Colq-
/
-
mice
revealed
that
MuSK-IgG
blocks
binding
of
ColQ
to
the
NMJ
.

In
vitro
plate-binding
of
MuSK
to
ColQ
disclosed
that
MuSK-IgG
exerts
a
dose-dependent
block
of
MuSK-ColQ
interaction
.

In
addition
,
passive
transfer
of
MuSK-IgG
to
mice
reduced
the
size
and
density
of
ColQ
to
∼10%
of
controls
and
had
a
lesser
effect
on
the
sizes
and
densities
of
AChR
and
MuSK
.

Elucidation
of
molecular
mechanisms
of
specific
binding
of
ColQ
to
the
NMJ
enabled
us
to
ameliorate
devastating
myasthenic
symptoms
of
Colq-
/
-
mice
and
to
reveal
bases
of
anti-MuSK
MG
.

:
a
preliminary
study
.
It
was
investigated
whether
ethanol
(
Et
)
modifies
the
damaging
impact
of
lead
(
Pb
)
on
bone
metabolism
in
a
rat
model
reflecting
excessive
alcohol
consumption
by
humans
exposed
to
relatively
high
levels
of
this
metal
.

For
this
purpose
,
markers
of
bone
formation
(
osteocalcin
,
procollagen
I
,
osteoprotegerin
,
alkaline
phosphatase
)
and
resorption
(
telopeptides
of
collagen
I
,
soluble
receptor
activator
of
nuclear
factor-κB
ligand
)
,
calciotropic
hormones
(
parathormone
,
calcitonin
,
25-hydroxyvitamin
D
and
1
,
25-dihydroxyvitamin
D
)
in
the
serum
,
and
the
femur
content
of
mineral
(
including
calcium
-
Ca
and
inorganic
phosphorus
-
Pi
)
and
organic
components
were
estimated
in
the
rats
exposed
to
500mg
Pb
/
l
(
in
drinking
water
)
or
/
and
Et
(
5g
/
kg
b
.

wt
.

/
24h
,
by
oral
gavage
)
for
12weeks
.

Moreover
,
Ca
and
Pi
in
the
serum
and
urine
,
alkaline
phosphatase
in
the
bone
tissue
and
Pb
in
the
blood
and
femur
were
determined
.

The
exposure
to
Pb
or
/
and
Et
decreased
bone
formation
and
increased
its
resorption
resulting
in
the
bone
demineralization
.

These
effects
were
accompanied
by
destroying
the
hormonal
regulation
of
mineral
metabolism
,
and
Ca
and
Pi
imbalance
.

The
co-exposure
to
Pb
and
Et-induced
disorders
in
bone
metabolism
were
more
advanced
than
those
caused
by
Pb
alone
.

Et
co-administration
increased
Pb
concentration
in
the
blood
and
decreased
its
accumulation
in
the
bone
.

This
paper
is
the
first
report
providing
evidence
that
consumption
of
Et
under
exposure
to
Pb
intensifies
disorders
in
bone
metabolism
and
that
destroying
of
the
receptor
activator
nuclear
factor-κB
(
RANK
)
/
RANK
ligand
/
osteoprotegerin
system
is
involved
in
the
mechanisms
of
interactive
action
of
these
xenobiotics
on
the
skeleton
.

The
modifying
impact
of
Et
may
be
an
effect
of
its
independent
osteotropic
action
and
interaction
with
Pb
.

Based
on
the
results
it
can
be
concluded
that
alcohol
abuse
by
subjects
excessively
exposed
to
Pb
considerably
increases
the
risk
of
bone
damage
.
Mutations
in
the
insulin
(
INS
)
gene
may
cause
permanent
neonatal
diabetes

(
PNDM
)
.

Ins2
mutant
mouse
models
provided
important
insights
into
the
disease
mechanisms
of
PNDM
but
have
limitations
for
translational
research
.

To
establish
a
large
animal
model
of
PNDM
,
we
generated
INS
(
C94Y
)
transgenic
pigs
.

A
line
expressing
high
levels
of
INS
(
C94Y
)
mRNA
(
70-86%
of
wild-type
INS
transcripts
)
exhibited
elevated
blood
glucose
soon
after
birth
but
unaltered
β-cell
mass
at
the
age
of
8
days
.

At
4
.
5
months
,
INS
(
C94Y
)
transgenic
pigs
exhibited
41%
reduced
body
weight
,
72%
decreased
β-cell
mass
(
-53%
relative
to
body
weight
)
,
and
60%
lower
fasting
insulin
levels
compared
with
littermate
controls
.

β-cells
of
INS
(
C94Y
)
transgenic
pigs
showed
a
marked
reduction
of
insulin
secretory
granules
and
severe
dilation
of
the
endoplasmic
reticulum
.

Cataract
development
was
already
visible
in
8-day-old
INS
(
C94Y
)
transgenic
pigs
and
became
more
severe
with
increasing
age
.

Diabetes-associated
pathological
alterations
of
kidney
and
nervous
tissue
were
not
detected
during
the
observation
period
of
1
year
.

The
stable
diabetic
phenotype
and
its
rescue
by
insulin
treatment
make
the
INS
(
C94Y
)
transgenic
pig
an
attractive
model
for
insulin
supplementation
and
islet

trials
,
and
for

The
present
study
was
to
evaluate
the
cholesterol-lowering
effect
of
two
novel
plant
stanol
derivatives
and
its
potential
molecular
mechanism
in
hyper-cholesterol
mice
induced
by
a
high-cholesterol
diet
.

Results
showed
that
oral
administration
of
plant
stanyl
hemisuccinate
(
2×
,
5×
)
and
plant
stanyl
sorbitol
succinate
(
2×
,
5×
)
effectively
attenuated
the
serum
total
cholesterol
and
low
density
lipoprotein
cholesterol
levels
,
while
had
no
effect
on
the
serum
triacylglycerol
and
high
density
lipoprotein
cholesterol
.

And
plant
stanol
derivatives
decreased
liver
cholesterol
concentration
and
increased
faecal
cholesterol
output
.

Meanwhile
,
both
plant
stanyl
hemisuccinate
and
plant
stanyl
sorbitol
succinate
could
remarkably
promote
liver
X
receptor
alpha
(
LXRα
)
expression
,
and
increased
cholesterol
7α-hydroxylase
(
CYP7A1
)
expression
and
faecal
total
bile
acid
output
to
varying
degrees
.

These
results
suggested
two
novel
plant
stanol
derivatives
possessed
hypocholesterolemic
effect
,
and
the
cholesterol-lowering
action
of
plant
stanol
derivatives
may
be
through
activating
the
potential
LXRα-CYP7A1-bile
acid
excretion
pathway
.

An
intestinal
immune
system
modulating
polysaccharide
(
CUI-3IIb-3-2
,
18kDa
)
was
purified
from
Citrus
unshiu
peel
.

CUI-3IIb-3-2
mainly
comprised
GalA
,
GlcA
,
Ara
,
Gal
and
Rha
,
and
it
consisted
of
4-linked
GalA
,
terminal
Araf
,
4-
or
5-linked
/
3
,
4-
or
3
,
5-branched
Ara
,
terminal
Gal
,
and
2-linked
/
2
,
4-branched
Rha
.

After
CUI-3IIb-3-2
digestion
by
endo-α-d-
(
1→4
)
-polygalacturonase
,
its
hydrolysate
was
fractionated
into
PG-1
and
PG-2
.

Methylation
analyses
of
PG-1
and
PG-2
using
base-catalysed
β-elimination
suggested
that
CUI-3IIb-3-2
be
assumed
as
pectic-type
polysaccharide
.

Since
the
activities
of
PG-1
and
PG-2
were
potently
decreased
,
the
whole
polysaccharide
structure
of
CUI-3IIb-3-2
would
be
essential
to
maintain
the
activity
.

Meanwhile
,
when
CUI-3IIb
was
orally
administered
in
mice
,
bone
marrow
cell
proliferation
and
GM-CSF
/
IL-6
production
from
Peyer's
patch
cell
were
significantly
higher
(
1
.
76-
and
2
.
03
/
2
.
51-fold
,
respectively
)
than
a
saline
.

Therefore
,
a
pectic-type
polysaccharide
from
citrus
peel
could
stimulate
Peyer's
patches
and
produce
hematopoietic
growth
factors
resulted
in
bone
marrow
cell
proliferation
.
The
insulin
/
IGF-1
pathway
controls
a
number
of
physiological
processes
in
the
nematode
worm
Caenorhabditis
elegans
,
including
development
,
aging
and
stress
response
.

We
previously
found
that
the
Akt
/
PKB
ortholog
AKT-1
dampens
the
apoptotic
response
to
genotoxic
stress
in
the
germline
by
negatively
regulating
the
p53-like
transcription
factor
CEP-1
.

Here
,
we
report
unexpected
rearrangements
to
the
insulin
/
IGF-1
pathway
,
whereby
the
insulin-like
receptor
DAF-2
and
3-phosphoinositide-dependent
protein
kinase
PDK-1
oppose
AKT-1
to
promote
DNA
damage-induced
apoptosis
.

While
DNA
damage
does
not
affect
phosphorylation
at
the
PDK-1
site
Thr350
/
Thr308
of
AKT-1
,
it
increased
phosphorylation
at
Ser517
/
Ser473
.

Although
ablation
of
daf-2
or
pdk-1
completely
suppressed
akt-1-dependent
apoptosis
,
the
transcriptional
activation
of
CEP-1
was
unaffected
,
suggesting
that
daf-2
and
pdk-1
act
independently
or
downstream
of
cep-1
and
akt-1
.

Ablation
of
the
akt-1
paralog
akt-2
or
the
downstream
target
of
the
insulin
/
IGF-1
pathway
daf-16
(
a
FOXO
transcription
factor
)
restored
sensitivity
to
damage-induced
apoptosis
in
daf-2
and
pdk-1
mutants
.

In
addition
,
daf-2
and
pdk-1
mutants
have
reduced
levels
of
phospho-MPK-1
/
ERK
in
their
germ
cells
,
indicating
that
the
insulin
/
IGF-1
pathway
promotes
Ras
signaling
in
the
germline
.

Ablation
of
the
Ras
effector
gla-3
,
a
negative
regulator
of
mpk-1
,
restored
sensitivity
to
apoptosis
in
daf-2
mutants
,
suggesting
that
gla-3
acts
downstream
of
daf-2
.

In
addition
,
the
hypersensitivity
of
let-60
/
Ras
gain-of-function
mutants
to
damage-induced
apoptosis
was
suppressed
to
wild-type
levels
by

In
detailed

of
how
these

,
[

showed
the

This
suggests
that

61
(

contributes
to
recognition
of

of
GnRH

,

not
of

(

compared
with

lacking
the

This
suggests
that
Asn2
.
65
(
101
)
recognizes
Gly10NH2
of
GnRH
II
.

GnRH

showed
large
decreases
in
potency
at
the
Lys3

This

recognizes
agonists
,
but
not
antagonists
,
as
in
the

These
data
indicate
that
roles
of
conserved

are
similar
,
but
not
identical
,

Exenatide
,
the

)
,
is
an
incretin
mimetic
that
has
been
developed
for
the
treatment
of
patients
with
type
2
diabetes
.

Exenatide
binds
to
and
activates
the
known
GLP-1
receptor
with
a
potency
comparable
to
that
of
the
mammalian
incretin
GLP-1
(
7-36
)
,
thereby
acting
as
a
glucoregulatory
agent
.

AC3174

of
exenatide
with

substituted
for
methionine
at

The
purpose
of
these
studies
was
to
evaluate
the
glucoregulatory
activity
and
pharmacokinetics
of
AC3174
.

In

,
the
potency
of
AC3174
for
the
displacement
of
[
(

I
]
GLP-1
and
activation
of
adenylate
cyclase
was
similar
to
that
of
exenatide
and
GLP-1
.

In
vivo
,
AC3174
,
administered
as
a
single
IP
injection
,
significantly
decreased
plasma
glucose
concentration
and

the
administration

)
.

The
magnitude
of
glucose
lowering
of
AC3174
was
comparable
to
exenatide
.

The

of
AC3174
resulted
in
a
4-fold
increase
in
insulin
concentrations
in
normal
mice
following
an
IP
glucose
challenge
.

AC3174
was
also
shown
to
inhibit
food
intake
and
decrease
gastric
emptying
in
rodent
models
.

AC3174
was
stable
in
human
plasma
(
>90%
of
parent

was
present
after
5
h
of
incubation
)
.

In
rats
,
the
in
vivo
half-life
of
AC3174
was
42-43
min
following
SC
administration
.

In
summary
,
AC3174
is
an
analog
of
exenatide
that
binds
to
the
GLP-1
receptor
in
vitro
and
shares
many
of
the
biological
and
glucoregulatory
activities
of
exenatide
and
GLP-1
in

.
Considering
the
prevalence

to
find
novel
compounds
targeting
the
angiotensin

,
accepted
as
a
therapeutic
target
in

,
with
an

indicating
that
it
had
no

significantly
inhibited

,
but
not
that
induced
by

.

The
suppressive
effect
of
ceruletide
on

could
be
partially
countered
by
MK-329
,
a
selective

.

Desulfated
cerulein
did
not
affect
the

These
findings
suggest
that
ceruletide
specifically
suppresses
the
barrel

evoked
by

in
a
long-lasting
manner
possibly
acting

of
the
rat

indicated
that
at

(

)
exist
in
the
cloned

upregulation
of
hypoxia-inducible
factor

-1α
at
mRNA
levels
in
cobalt

.

Thus
,
LO
is
a

.

Dominant

activities
stimulated
by
Co
.

Electrophoretic
mobility

indicated
that
only
one
HRE
mapped
at
-387
/
-383
relative
to
ATG
was
functionally
active
among
four
consensuses
.

Site-directed
mutation
of
this
HRE
significantly
diminished
the
Co-induced

LO
promoter-directed
expression
of
the

Cadmium

Thus
,

In
addition
,
the
APOE4

was
analyzed
.

Results
:
The
novel
ABCA7
SNP
,
rs3752246
,
tended
to
be
associated
with
AD
in
our
study
.

Variants
in
ABCB1
were
significantly
less
frequent
in
AD
cases
older
than
65
years
of
age
and
among
females
.

This
association
of
ABCB1

(
rs2032582
)
was
more
pronounced
in
APOE4-negative
cases
(

)
.

However
,
only
ABCC2
3972C>T
(
rs3740066
)
was
significantly
associated
with
AD
risk
after
logistic
regression
analysis
including
all
variants
.

Other
transporters
showed
a
lack
of
association
.

Conclusion
:
Our
results
support
the
hypothesis
that
ABCB1
and
possibly
other
ABC-transporters
are
involved
in
the
process
of
Aβ
accumulation
in
the
aging
brain
and
may
modulate
the
risk
for
AD
in
an
allele-specific
manner
,
and
thus
might
represent
a
new
target
for
prevention
and
treatment
of
AD

β-Ionone
is
an
end
ring
analog
of
β-carotenoid
which
has
been
shown
to
possess
potent
anti-proliferative
activity
both
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
.

To
investigate
the
possible
inhibitory
effects
of
β-ionone
,
we
studied
cell
growth
characteristics
,
DNA
synthesis
,
cell
cycle
progression
,
as
well
as
mitogen-activated
protein
kinases
(
MAPKs
)
pathways
in
the
human
gastric
adenocarcinoma
cancer
cell
line
(
SGC-7901
)
.

Our
results
show
that
cell
growth
and
DNA
synthesis
were
inhibited
,
and
the
cell
cycle
was
arrested
at
the
G0
/
G1
phase
in
a
dose-dependent
manner
in
cells
treated
with
β-ionone
(
25
,
50
,
100
and
200
μmol
/
L
)
for
24
h
.

We
found
that
the
β-ionone
significantly
decreased
the
extracellular
signal-regulated
kinase
protein
expression
and
significantly
increased
the
levels
of
p38
and
Jun-amino-terminal
kinase
protein
expression
(
P
<
0
.
01
)
.

β-Ionone
also
inhibited
cell
cycle-related
proteins
of
Cdk4
,
Cyclin
B1
,
D1
and
increased
p27
protein
expression
in
SGC-7901
cells
.

These
results
suggested
that
the
cell
cycle
arrest
observed
may
be
regulated
through
a
MAPK
pathway
by
transcriptional
down-regulation
of
cell
cycle
proteins
.

These
results
demonstrate
potent
ability
of
β-ionone
to
arrest
cell
cycle
of
SGC-7901
cells
and
decrease
proliferation
.

We
identified
benzo

pyridoindoles
(
BePI
)
as
powerful
aurora
kinase
inhibitors
.

Their
efficiency
was
demonstrated
both
in
enzymatic
inhibition
studies
and
in
cell

assays
.

New
BePI
molecules
were
synthesized
,
and
a
structure-activity
relationship
study
was
conducted
with
the
aim
of
improving
the
activity
and
solubility
of
the
lead
compound
.

Tetracyclic
BePI

are
characterized
by
a
particular

and
the
presence
of
an

on

was
found
to
be
required
for

inhibition
.

New
hydrosoluble

were
subsequently
designed
,
and
their
efficacy
was
tested
by
a
combination
of
cell-cycle
analysis

time-lapse
experiments
in

The

.

The
inability
to
culture
Pneumocystis
prevents
routine
susceptibility
testing
and
detection
of
drug
resistance
.

Instead
,
molecular
techniques
have
been
used
to
detect
Pneumocystis
jiroveci
dihydropteroate
synthase
(
DHPS
)
mutations
that
cause
sulfa
resistance
in
other
microorganisms
.

The
most
frequent
DHPS
mutations
occur
at
nucleotide
positions
165
and
171
,
which
lead
to
an
amino
acid
change
at
positions
55
and
57
.

Several
studies
suggest
that
these
mutations
are
associated
with
the
failure
of
chemoprophylaxis
for
PcP
.

The
aim
was
to
establish
the
frequency
and
characteristics
of
P
jiroveci
DHPS
mutations
among
colonized
individuals
and
PcP
patients
from
Spain
.

A
total
of
50
colonized
individuals
and
25
PcP
patients
were
studied
.

DHPS
polymorphisms
were
identified
by
restriction
fragment
length
polymorphism
assay
.

The
analysis
provided
a
rate
of
28%
of
DHPS
gene
mutations
in
our
population
,
with
the
presence
of
all
possible
polymorphisms
described
.

The
presence
of
mutations
was
higher
in
PcP
patients
than
in
colonized
subjects
(
40%
vs
22%
)
,
probably
because
of
the
chemoprophylaxis
used
in
PcP
patients
.

The
comparison
between
patients
with
and
without
DHPS
mutations
did
not
show
statistical
differences
due
to
age
,
sex
,
steroid
use
,
sulfa
drug
exposure
,
or
smoking
.

A
high
rate
of
DHPS
mutations
in
our
area
of
Spain
,
not
only
confined
to
patients
previously
exposed
to
sulfa
drugs
,
is
shown
in
this
study
.

As
well
as
PcP
patients
,
colonized
individuals
who
harbor
P
jiroveci
strains
with
DHPS
mutations
could
play
a
major
role
in
the
transmission
cycle
of
these
mutations
,
representing
a
reservoir
and
source
of
infection
for
susceptible
individuals
.

Further
research
is
thus
warranted
to
assess
the
true
scope
of
the
problem
and
to
design
rational
preventive
strategies
.
The
ATP-sensitive
potassium
(
KATP
)
channels
in
pancreatic
beta
cells
are
critical
in
the
regulation
of
glucose-induced
insulin
secretion
.

Although
electrophysiological
studies
provide
clues
to
the
complex
control
of
KATP
channels
by
ATP
,
MgADP
,
and
pharmacological
agents
,
the
molecular
mechanism
of
KATP-channel
regulation
remains
unclear
.

The
KATP
channel
is
a
heterooligomeric
complex
of
SUR1
subunits
of
the
ATP-binding-cassette
superfamily
with
two
nucleotide-binding
folds
(
NBF1
and
NBF2
)
and
the
pore-forming
Kir6
.
2
subunits
.

Here
,
we
report
that
MgATP
and
MgADP
,
but
not
the
Mg
salt
of
gamma-thio-ATP
,
stabilize
the
binding
of
prebound
8-azido-
[
alpha-32P
]
ATP
to
SUR1
.

Mutation
in
the
Walker
A
and
B
motifs
of
NBF2
of
SUR1
abolished
this
stabilizing
effect
of
MgADP
.

These
results
suggest
that
SUR1
binds
8-azido-ATP
strongly
at
NBF1
and
that
MgADP
,
either
by
direct
binding
to
NBF2
or
by
hydrolysis
of
bound
MgATP
at
NBF2
,
stabilizes
prebound
8-azido-ATP
binding
at
NBF1
.

The
sulfonylurea
glibenclamide
caused
release
of
prebound
8-azido-
[
alpha-32P
]
ATP
from
SUR1
in
the
presence
of
MgADP
or
MgATP
in
a
concentration-dependent
manner
.

This
direct
biochemical
evidence
of
cooperative
interaction
in
nucleotide
binding
of
the
two
NBFs
of
SUR1
suggests
that
glibenclamide
both
blocks
this
cooperative
binding
of
ATP
and
MgADP
and
,
in
cooperation
with
the
MgADP
bound
at
NBF2
,
causes
ATP
to
be
released
from
NBF1
.

It
is
well
known
that
UVB
(
290-320
nm
)
induces
inflammation
in
skin
by
the
transcription
and
release
of
cytokines
and
chemokines
from
skin
keratinocytes
.

In
addition
,
it
is
considered
that
intracellular
reactive
oxygen
species
(
ROS
)
plays
an
important
role
in
UVB-induced
inflammatory
response
in
the
skin
.

Therefore
,
we
investigated
the
effect
of
vitamin
C
,
a
potent
antioxidant
,
on
the
regulation
of
UVB-induced
skin
inflammation
via
the
modulation
of
chemokines
production
.

Vitamin
C
uptake
into
keratinocytes
is
increased
by
UVB
irradiation
in
a
time-
and
dose-dependent
manner
through
the
translocation
of
sodium-dependent
vitamin
C
transporter-1
(
SVCT-1
)
,
a
vitamin
C-specific
transporter
,
from
the
cytosol
to
the
membrane
.

To
evaluate
the
effect
of
vitamin
C
on
the
chemokine
mRNA
expression
,
we
performed
RNase
protection
assay
.

As
a
result
,
there
was
a
remarkable
change
in
chemokine
mRNA
expression
,
especially
IL-8
and
monocyte
chemoattractant
protein
(
MCP
)
-1
expression
.

In
addition
,
increased
IL-8
and
MCP-1
mRNA
expressions
were
suppressed
by
vitamin
C
treatment
.

We
also
confirmed
the
results
of
protein
levels
measured
by
ELISA
.

Taken
together
,
vitamin
C
uptake
is
increased
in
UVB-irradiated
keratinocytes
through
the
translocation
of
SVCT-1
and
regulates
inflammatory
response
in
the
skin
via
the
downregulation
of
IL-8
and

production

The
use
of
leflunomide
in
the
treatment
of
rheumatoid
arthritis
:
an
experimental
and
clinical
review
.
We
investigated
the
basis
for
the
difference
in
the
cardiotonic
effects
of
the
PDE3
inhibitors
cilostazol
and
milrinone
in
the
rabbit
heart
.

Cilostazol
displayed
greater
selectivity
than
milrinone
for
inhibition
of
cAMP-PDE
activity
in
microsomal
vs
cytosolic
fractions
from
rabbit
heart
.

This
difference
was
due
to
the
inhibition
of
significantly
less
cytosolic
cAMP-PDE
activity
by
cilostazol
compared
to
milrinone
.

A
combination
of
cilostazol
(
>15
microM
)
and
the
PDE4
selective
inhibitor
,
rolipram
(
5
microM
)
,
inhibited
levels
of
cytosolic
cAMP-PDE
activity
similar
to
those
inhibited
by
milrinone
on
its
own
.

This
suggested
that
milrinone
inhibited
PDE4
in
addition
to
PDE3
activity
.

In
isolated
rabbit
cardiomyocytes
,
milrinone
(
>10
microM
)
caused
greater
elevations
in
intracellular
cAMP
and
calcium
than
cilostazol
.

In
the
presence
of
rolipram
,
however
,
the
cAMP
and
calcium
elevating
effects
of
cilostazol
and
milrinone
were
similar
.

Therefore
,
in
rabbit
heart
,
partial
inhibition
of
PDE4
by
milrinone
contributed
to
greater
increases
in
cardiomyocyte
cAMP
and
calcium
levels
than
cilostazol
.

PDE4
activity
in
failing
human
heart
was
lower
than
in
rabbit
heart
and
there
was
no
significant
difference
in
the
inhibition
of
human
cytosolic
cAMP-PDE
by
cilostazol
and
milrinone
.

Our
results
suggest
that
in
normal
rabbit
heart
inhibition
of
PDE4
by
milrinone
may
partly
contribute
to
the
greater
cardiotonic
effect
of
milrinone
when
compared
to
cilostazol
.

However
,
the
lower
level
of
PDE4
activity
in
failing
human
heart
suggests
that
factors
other
than
inhibition
of
PDE4
by
milrinone
may
contribute
to
differences
in
cardiotonic
action
when
compared
to
cilostazol
.

To

graphite
,
we
apply
angle-resolved
near-edge
X-ray
absorption
fine

(
NEXAFS

spectroscopy
and
quantum-chemical
modeling
.

The
strong
angular
dependence
of
the
CK
and
FK
edge
NEXAFS
spectra
on
the
incident
radiation
indicates
that
room-temperature-produced
graphite
fluoride
is
a
highly
anisotropic
material
,
where
half
of
the
carbon
atoms
are
covalently
bonded
with
fluorine
,
while
the
rest
of
the
carbon
atoms
preserve
π
electrons
.

Comparison
of
the
experimental
CK
edge
spectrum
with
theoretical
spectra
plotted
for
C
(
2

F
models
reveals
that
fluorine
atoms
are

Thionamides
,
inhibitors

peroxidase-mediated
iodination
,
are
clinically
used
in
the
treatment
of
hyperthyroidism
.

However
,
the
use
of
antithyroid
drugs
is
associated
with
immunomodulatory
effects
,
and
recent
studies
with
thionamide-related
heterocyclic
thioderivates
demonstrated
direct
anti-inflammatory
and
immunosuppressive
properties
.

Using
primary
human
T-lymphocytes
,
we
show
that
the
heterocyclic
thionamides
carbimazole
and
propylthiouracil
inhibit
synthesis
of
the
proinflammatory
cytokines
tumor
necrosis

(
TNF
)

and

In

,
and
NF-kappaB-dependent

were
reduced
.

Abrogation
of
NF-kappaB
activity
was
accompanied
by
reduced

and
proteolytic
degradation
of
inhibitor
of
kappaB
(
IkappaB
)
alpha
,
the
inhibitory
subunit
of
the
NF-kappaB
complex
.

Carbimazole
inhibited
NF-kappaB
via
the
small
GTPase
Rac-1
,
whereas
propylthiouracil
inhibited
the
phosphorylation
of
IkappaBalpha
by
its
kinase
inhibitor
of
kappaB
kinase
alpha
.

Methimazole
had
no
effect
on
NF-kappaB
induction
,
demonstrating
that
drug
potency
correlated
with
the
chemical
reactivity
of
the
thionamide-associated
sulfur
group
.

Taken
together
,
our
data
demonstrate
that
thioureylenes
with
a
common
,
heterocyclic
structure
inhibit
inflammation
and
immune
function
via
the
NF-kappaB

.

Our
results
may
explain
the
observed
remission
of
proinflammatory
diseases
upon
antithyroid
therapy
in

The
use
of

the

posit
that

Maturation
of
neuromuscular

during
early
development
in

.
Male
and
female
Sprague-Dawley
rats
were
administered
quinpirole
(
1
mg

,
i
.

p
.

)
or
saline
once
daily
from
postnatal
day
(
P
)
1
to
P21
.

This
drug
treatment
has
been
shown
to
produce
long-term
priming
of
the
D2
receptor
.

Beginning
on
P62
,
rats
were
administered
the
atypical
antipsychotic
olanzapine
(
2
.
5
mg
/
kg
)
or
saline
twice
daily
(
i
.

p
.

)
for
28
days
.

One
day
after
olanzapine
treatment
ceased
,
rats
were
tested
on
the
place
and
match-to-place
versions
of
the
Morris
water
maze
(
MWM
)
for
seven
consecutive
days
.

Dopamine
D2
receptor
priming
was
verified
through
a
yawning
behavioural
test
,
a
D2
receptor-mediated
event
,
before
olanzapine
was
administered
as
well
as
after
olanzapine
treatment
and
behavioural
testing
were
complete
.

Results
showed
that
neonatal
quinpirole
treatment
induced
D2
priming
that
was
eliminated
by
olanzapine
treatment
.

On
the
MWM
place
version
,
D2-primed
rats
demonstrated
a
significant
impairment
that
was
eliminated
by
olanzapine
treatment
,
but
olanzapine
treatment
to
animals
neonatally
treated
with
saline
produced
a
significant
deficit
on
the
place
version
of
the
MWM
.

There
were
no
significant
deficits
on
the
match-to-place
version
.

Brain
tissue
analyses
revealed
that
neonatal
quinpirole
treatment
produced
a
significant
decrease
in
hippocampal
NGF
,
BDNF
and
ChAT
that
was
eliminated
by
olanzapine
treatment
.

Neonatal
quinpirole
treatment
produced
a
significant
decrease
in
BDNF
and
ChAT
in
the
frontal
cortex
that
was
unaffected
by
olanzapine
treatment
.

These
results
show
that
olanzapine
eliminates
D2
receptor
priming
and
cognitive
impairment
and
also
alleviates
decreases
in
neurotrophins
and
acetylcholinergic
markers
produced

Cigarette
smoking
causes
cellular
oxidative
stress
resulting
in
inflammatory
diseases
of
lung
wherein
transcription
factor
NF-κB
plays
an
important
role
.

It
is
possible
that
vitamin
C
,
an
antioxidant
,
may
prevent
cigarette
smoke
(
CS
)
-induced
NF-κB
activation
that
involves
degradation
of
I-κBε
and
nuclear
translocation
of
c-Rel
/
p50
in
alveolar
epithelial
cells
.

Therefore
,
to
examine
the
hypothesis
,
we
verified
the
effect
of
vitamin
C
on
CS-induced
expression
of
NF-κB
driven
luciferase
reporter
and
NF-κB
binding
at
its
target
DNA
by
EMSA
in
alveolar
epithelial
A549
cells
.

We
also
examined
the
level
of
I-κBε
and
sub-cellular
distribution
of
c-Rel
by
western
blotting
and
immunofluorescence
respectively
in
CSE-treated
A549
cells
with
or
without
vitamin
C
pretreatment
.

We
observed
a
significant
reduction
in
CSE
induced
luciferase
expression
,
NF-κB
DNA
binding
,
I-κBε
degradation
and
c-Rel
nuclear
translocation
in
cells
pretreated
with
vitamin
C
.

To
further
validate
the
result
,
we
examined
sub-cellular
distribution
of
c-Rel
in
lungs
of
CS-exposed
guinea
pigs
treated
or
untreated
with
vitamin
C
.

Result
showed
that
vitamin
C
treatment
resulted
in
markedly
reduced
c-Rel
nuclear
translocation
.

All
these
results
demonstrate
that
vitamin
C
prevents
CS
(
E
)
-induced
NF-κB
activation
and
thus
it
could
be
used
for
the
prevention
of
CS-induced
inflammatory
diseases

To
evaluate
the
cytokine
balance
and
enzymatic
alterations
induced
by
environmental
pesticide
exposure
during
pregnancy
,
this
transversal
study
explored
placentas
derived
from
non-exposed
women
(
control
group-CG
)
,
and
from
women
living
in
a
rural
area
(
rural

)
,
collected
during
intensive
organophosphate
(
OP
)
pesticide
spraying
season
(
RG-SS
)
and
during
non-spraying
season
(
RG-NSS
)
.

The
exposure
biomarkers
blood
cholinesterase
and
placental
carboxylesterase
(
CaE
)
were
significantly
decreased
in
RG-SS
.

Among
the
cytokines
studied
IL-8
,
IL-6
,
TNFα
,
IL-10
,
TGFβ
and
IL-13
,
the
expression
frequency
of
IL-13
increased
in
RG-SS
.

Arginase
and
ornithine
decarboxylase
(
ODC
)
enzymes
were
induced
in
syncytiotrophoblast
and
endothelial
cells
.

Interestingly
,
the
decrease
in
CaE
activity
was
associated
with
arginase
and
ODC
activity
induction
.

These
findings
suggest
that
environmental
pesticide
exposure
impacts
the
placenta
by
increasing
the
expression
frequency
of
the
anti-inflammatory
cytokine
IL-13
,
which
may
be
related
to
the
up-regulation

We
have
previously
reported
that
NADPH
oxidase
2
(
Nox2
)
is
up-regulated
in
spinal
cord
microglia
after
spinal
nerve
injury
,
demonstrating
that
it
is
critical
for
microglia
activation
and
subsequent
pain
hypersensitivity
.

However
,
the
mechanisms
and
molecules
involved
in
Nox2
induction
have
not
been
elucidated
.

Previous
studies
have
shown
that
Toll-like
receptors
(
TLRs
)
are
involved
in
nerve
injury-induced
spinal
cord
microglia
activation
.

In
this
study
,
we
investigated
the
role
of
TLR
in
Nox2
expression
in
spinal
cord
microglia
after
peripheral
nerve
injury
.

Studies
using
TLR
knock-out
mice
have
shown
that
nerve
injury-induced
microglial
Nox2
up-regulation
is
abrogated
in
TLR2
but
not
in
TLR3
or
-4
knock-out
mice
.

Intrathecal
injection
of
lipoteichoic
acid
,
a
TLR2
agonist
,
induced
Nox2
expression
in
spinal
cord
microglia
both
at
the
mRNA
and
protein
levels
.

Similarly
,
lipoteichoic
acid
stimulation
induced
Nox2
expression
and
reactive
oxygen
species
production
in
primary
spinal
cord
glial
cells
in
vitro
.

Studies
on
intracellular
signaling
pathways
indicate
that
NF-κB
and
p38
MAP
kinase
activation
is
required
for
TLR2-induced
Nox2
expression
in
glial
cells
.

Conclusively
,
our
data
show
that
TLR2
mediates
nerve
injury-induced
Nox2
gene
expression
in
spinal
cord
microglia
via
NF-κB
and
p38
activation
and
thereby
may
contribute
to
spinal

in

Beta

were
assessed
by

.

Dose-response

was
used
to

.

There
were
dose-related
increases
in

.

Reduction

was
significantly

There
were
small

There
were
similar

These
results
show
that
conventional
doses

therefore
possess

PURPOSE
:
To
determine
whether
the
temperature-sensitive
rat
retinal
pigment
epithelial
cell
line
(
RPE-J
)
express
mRNA
transcripts
for
apolipoprotein
(
apo
)
and
microsomal
triglyceride
transfer
protein
(
MTP
)
and
whether
it
can
synthesize
and
secrete
neutral
lipids
.

METHODS
:
RPE-J
cells
were
cultured
in
plastic
tissue
culture
flasks
and
on
Transwell
filters
.

RT-PCR
was
used
to
check
mRNA
expression
.

Phagocytosis
was
checked
by
adding
FITC-labeled
beads
and
measuring
the
intensity
of
the
fluorescence
.

Lipids
were
extracted
from
cultured
cells
that
were
fed
photoreceptor
outer
segments
(
OS
)
for
24h;
thin
layer
chromatography
and
enzymatic
fluorimetry
were
used
to
assay
lipid
content
.

Cells
were
supplemented
with
[
3H
]
-oleate
(
5000
dpm
/
nmole
)
bound
to
1
.
5%
fatty
acid
free
bovine
serum
albumin
in
order
to
permit
detection
of
the
new
synthesis
and
secretion
of
neutral
lipids
.

RESULTS
:
RPE-J
cells
express
mRNA
for
apoA-I
,
apoA-II
,
apoB
,
apoC-I
,
II
,
III
,
and
apo
E
,
as
well
as
MTP
.

RPE-J
cells
can
phagocytose
OS
and
beads
.

OS-fed
RPE-J
cells
,
relative
to
untreated
cells
,
have
5
.
8
times
more
triglyceride
,
2
.
6
times
more
phospholipid
,
1
.
5
times
more
unesterified
cholesterol
,
and
0
.
3
times
more
esterified
cholesterol
.

Radiolabeled
neutral
lipid
is
detected
in
cells
and
medium
.

All
lipids
increase
in
cells
with
time
but
only
phospholipid
increases
in
the
medium
with
time
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
RPE
cells
express
genes
encoding
apolipoproteins
and
MTP
.

Following
the
ingestion
of
OS
,
RPE-J
cells
contain
abundant
lipid
.

Following
the
ingestion
of
long-chain
fatty
acids
,
RPE-J
cells
can
synthesize
neutral
lipids
.

Future
experiments
will
determine
if
RPE-J
cells
secrete
lipoprotein
particles

Human
follistatin
is
a
regulatory
glycoprotein
with
widespread
biologic
functions
,
including
antiinflammatory
activities
,
wound-healing
properties
,
and
muscle-stimulating
effects
.

The
role
of
follistatin
in
a
wide
range
of
biologic
activities
shows
promise
for
potential
clinical
application
,
which
has
prompted
considerable
interest
in
the
investigation
of
the
protein
as
a
potential
disease-modifying
agent
.

In
spite
of
this
potential
,
the
development
of
follistatin
as
a
broad
use
biotherapeutic
has
been
severely
hindered
by
a
poor
understanding
and
characterization
of
its
pharmacokinetic
/
pharmacodynamic
(
PK
/
PD
)
relationships
.

Therefore
,
to
better
define
these
relationships
,
we
performed
in-depth
analyses
of
the
PK
/
PD
relationships
of
native
follistatin-315
(
FST315
)
.

Our
data
indicate
that
the
intrinsic
PK
/
PD
properties
of
native
FST315
are
poorly
suited
for
acting
as
a
parentally
administered
biotherapeutic
with
broad
systemic
effects
.

Here
,
we
leveraged
protein
engineering
to
modify
the
PK
characteristics
of
the
native
molecule
by
fusing
FST315
to
a
murine
IgG
(
1
)
Fc
and
removing
the
intrinsic
heparan
sulfate-binding
activity
of
follistatin
.

The
engineered
variant
molecule
had
~100-
and
~1600-fold
improvements
in
terminal
half-life
and
exposure
,
respectively
.

In
contrast
to
the
native
FST315
,
the
variant
showed
a
robust
,
dose-dependent
pharmacological
effect
when
administered
subcutaneously
on
a
weekly
basis
in
mouse
models
of
muscle
atrophy
and
degeneration
.

These
studies
highlight
the
underappreciated
and
critical
relationship
between
optimizing
multiple
physical
and
chemical
properties
of
follistatin
on
its
overall
PK
/
PD
profile
.

Moreover
,
our
findings
provide
the
first
documented
strategy
toward
the
development
of
a
follistatin
therapeutic
with
potential
use
in
patients
affected
with
skeletal
muscle
diseases
.
The

mutation
,
which
activates
the

pathway
,
commonly
occurs
in
about
8%
of
all
human
malignancies
and
about
50%
of
all
melanomas
.

In
this

,
we
employed
virtual
screening
and
chemical
synthesis
to
identify
a

as
potent

In
this
study
,
the
requirement
for
acid

and
sphingomyelin
metabolites
in
the
TNFalpha
/
prostaglandin
E
(
2
)
(
PGE
(

)
)
pathway
was
investigated
.

The
amphiphilic
compound
desipramine
,
a
frequently
employed
inhibitor
of
acid
sphingomyelinase
(
ASMase
)
,
blocked
PGE
(
2
)
production
.

However
,
the
action
of
desipramine
was
independent
of
its
action
on
ASMase
,
since
neither
genetic
loss
of
ASMase
(
Niemann-Pick
fibroblasts
)
nor
knockdown
of
ASMase
using
RNA
interference
affected
TNFalpha-induced
PGE
(
2
)
synthesis
.

Further
investigations
revealed
that
desipramine
down-regulated
acid
ceramidase
(
AC
)
,
but
not
sphingosine
kinase
,
at
the
protein
level
.

This
resulted
in
a
time-dependent
drop
in
sphingosine
and
S1P
levels
.

Moreover
,
exogenous
administration
of
either
sphingosine
or
S1P
rescued
PGE
(
2
)
biosynthesis
after
desipramine
treatment
.

Interestingly
,
knockdown
of
endogenous
AC
by
RNA
interference
attenuated
cyclooxygenase
2
induction
by
TNFalpha
and
subsequent
PGE
(

)
biosynthesis
.

Taken
together
,
these
results
define
a
novel
role
for
AC
in
the
TNFalpha
/
PGE
(
2
)
pathway
.

In
addition
,
the
results
of
this
study
warrant
careful
reconsideration
of
desipramine
as
a
specific
inhibitor
for
ASMase
.
The
effects
of
aluminium

(
Al-lactate
)
on
the
rat
cerebral
synaptosome
integral
proteins
adenosinetriphosphatase
(
ATPase
)
and
acetylcholinesterase
(
AChE
)
were
studied
in

and
in

.

Coexposure
with
ethanol

was
studied
in
both
situations
.

Isolation
of
synaptosomes
was
carried
out
using

.

In
in
vitro
experiments
,
the
synaptosomes
were
exposed
to
different
concentrations
of
Al-lactate
in
the
incubation
mixture
.

Al-lactate
caused
decreases
in
total
ATPase
and
AChE
activities

.

The
decrease
in
ATP
activity
started
at

2

,
and
concentration
for
the
50%
decrease
of
the
enzyme
activity
(

)
was

.

The
decrease
in
AChE
activity
started
at
5-10

,
and
the
EC50
value
was
15
.
8
mM
.

Coexposure
with
ethanol
(
2
mM
)
increased
the
EC50
values
similarly
in
both
cases
.

After
90-day
oral
exposure
of
rats
to
Al-lactate
(

increase
the

Aluminium

compared
with

EtOH
(

in
the

exposed
to

only
.

In
the
rats
studied
2
weeks
after
the
Al
exposure
,
the
activities
of
ATPase
and
AChE
were
significantly
lower
than
in
the
rats
studied
immediately
after
the
exposure
.

Correspondingly
,
a
significant
decrease
in
AChE
activity
was
found
in
Al
and
EtOH-exposed
rats
,
but
in
the
control
rats
there
were
no
differences
between
the
study
groups
.

Immediately
after
the
90-day
dosing
,
the
exposed
rats
did
not
differ
significantly
from
the
control
rats
.

Based
on
the
in

results
,
the
neural
membrane
integral
proteins
ATPase
and
AChE
may
be
considered
as
targets
for
the
effects
of
aluminium
and
ethanol
.

Ninety-day
in

exposure
of
rats
to
aluminium
caused
decrease
in

The
neurospecific
cholesterol
24-hydroxylase
converts
excess
brain
cholesterol
into
24S-hydroxycholesterol
(
24OHC
)
which
,
via
the
liver
X
receptor
(
LXR
)
,
can
increase
the
expression
and
synthesis
of
astrocyte
ApoE
.

24OHC
effluxes
directly
from
brain
into
plasma
where
it
is
considered
an
indicator
of
brain
cholesterol
turnover
.

It
is
reduced
in
neurodegenerative
disease
states
proportionally
to
the
severity
of
disease
and
the
degree
of
brain
atrophy
.

In
the
early
phases
of
active
disease
,
a
higher
rate
of
turnover
may
result
in
transitory
increases
in
plasma
24OHC
.

Less
than
1%
of
the
total
brain
excretion
of
24OHC
occurs
via
the
cerebrospinal
fluid
(
CSF
)
whereas
almost
all
27-hydroxycholesterol
(
27OHC
)
excretion
is
dependent
on
the
function
of
the
blood-cerebrospinal
fluid
barrier
.

Iincreased
CSF
oxysterols
were
found
in
patients
with
neurodegenerative
and
neuroinflammatory
diseases
in
the
presence
of
barrier
dysfunction
.

In
neurodegeneration
,
free
cholesterol
released
from
dying
cells
may
engulf
neurons
.

Cholesterol
also
increases
Amyloid
β
(
Aβ
)
deposition
and
tau
pathology
.

ApoE
,
24OHC
,
tau
and
soluble
APP
were
correlated
in
Alzheimer
disease
(
AD
)
samples
.

Excess
of
cholesterol
converted
into
24OHC
may
up-regulate
ApoE
synthesis
which
is
a
scavenger
for
Aβ
and
Tau
.

In
AD
this
protective
mechanism
seems
to
be
inefficient
,
probably
due
to
the
presence
of
high
concentrations
of
27OHC
,
microvascular
dysfunction
and
the
decreased
efficiency
of
ApoE4
as
lipid
transporter
and
Aβ
scavenger
.

24OHC
itself
was
cytotoxic
.

Analysis
of
side
chain
oxysterols
in
the
CSF
is
likely
to
provided
useful
information
about
cholesterol
metabolism
and
ApoE
function
in
the
pathogenesis
of
AD

To
investigate
the
capacity
of
activated
PKC
to
regulate

,
we
incubated
the
smooth
muscle
strips
with
the
combination
of
both
1

PMA
and
1

fenoterol
.

This
combined
treatment
synergistically
decreased
the
isoprenaline-induced
maximal

,
as
compared
to
the
individual
effects
of
PMA
and
fenoterol
alone
,
indicating
a
common

for
heterologous

for
all

used
,
including
control
conditions
,
and
the
synergistic
effects
of

fenoterol
were
completely
prevented
.

In
conclusion
,
the
present
study
demonstrates
that
homologous
desensitization
of
the

can
be
enhanced
by

For

evidence
that
this

.

An
understanding
of
the
structural
relationships
between
the
three
subunits
and
their
redundancy
and
specificity
is
essential
for
understanding
the
ubiquitous
FGF
signaling
system
in
health
and
disease
.

Previously
,
we
reported
that
a
primary
heparin
or
heparan
sulfate
binding
site
resides
in
a
distinct
sequence
in
immunoglobulin
(
Ig
)
-like
module
II
of
the
three
modules
of
FGFR
.

Here
we
report
that
in
the
absence
of
flanking
sequences
,
isolated
Ig
module
II
of
FGFR1
supports
the
binding
of
FGF-1
,
FGF-2
,
and
FGF-7
in
respective
order
of
affinity
.

None
of
the
three
FGFs
detectably
bind
Ig
module
I
or
the
IIIb
and
IIIc
splice
variants
of
Ig
module
III
in
the
absence
of
flanking
sequences
.

Ig
module
I
and
the
C-terminus
of
Ig
module
III
are
dispensable
for
high-affinity
binding
of
FGF-1
,
FGF-2
,
and
FGF-7
.

Alterations
in

conserved
Ig

and
substitution
of
individual
sequence
domains
spanning
the
entire
sequence
of
Ig
module
II
with
those
from
Ig
module
I
obliterated
FGF
binding
.

Addition
of
a
specific
number
of
FGFR
sequences
to
the
C-terminus
of
Ig
module
II
resulted
in
a
gain
in
affinity
for
FGF-7
.

Several
site-specific
alterations
in
the
C-terminus
of

FGFR1IIIc
,

isoform
that
otherwise
absolutely
rejects

resulted
in
gain

.

These
results
suggest
that
a
complex
of
Ig
module
II
and
heparan
sulfate
is
the
base
common
active
core
of
the
FGFR

and
that

Estramustine
,
and
derivatives
of
estramustine
with
a
charged
substituent
at
position
17
on
the
estrogen
moiety
,
have
been
investigated
for
their
effects
on
bovine
brain
microtubules
in
vitro
.

The
negatively
charged
estramustine
phosphate
has
been
found
previously
to
be
a
microtubule-associated
protein
(
MAP
)
-dependent
microtubule
inhibitor
[

,
Deinum
J
and
Friden
B
,
FEBS

:

,

]
.

In
the
present
study
the
binding
of
estramustine
phosphate
to
MAP2
and
tau
was
investigated
.

Both
these
MAPs
were
found
to
have
two
to
three
binding
sites
for
estramustine
phosphate
which
is
compatible
with
the
reported
number
of
basic
amino
acid
repeats
of
these
MAPs
,
considered
to
be
the
ultimate
tubulin
binding
domains
.

The
Kd
for
the
binding
of
estramustine
phosphate
to
MAP2
was
estimated
to
be
20
microM
at
4
degrees
,
and
for
the
binding
of
tau
,
200
microM
.

The
rate
of
dissociation
was
very
low
(
T1
/
2
greater
than
2
hr
)
,
which
indicates
that
the
binding
of
estramustine
phosphate
may
stabilize
the
protein-drug
complex
by
changing
the
protein
conformation
.

Two
new
negatively
charged
estramustine
derivatives
,
estramustine
sulphate
and
estramustine
glucuronide
,
were
found
to
be
similar
MAP-dependent
microtubule
inhibitors
.

The
concentration
for
50%
inhibition
of
assembly
was
100
microM
for
the
sulphate
derivative
,
the
same
as
found
previously
for
estramustine
phosphate
,
and
250
microM
for
the
more
bulky
estramustine
glucuronide
.

A
positively
charged
derivative
,
estramustine
sarcosinate
,
did
not
inhibit
microtubule
assembly
or
alter
the
composition
of
the
coassembled
MAPs
.

The
morphology
of
the
microtubules
was
,
however
,
affected
.

The
uncharged
estramustine
bound
to
both
tubulin
and
MAPs
,
but
no
effects
were
seen
on
microtubule
assembly
,
the
composition
of
coassembled
MAPs
or
the
microtubule
morphology
.

Our
results
suggest
that
only
negatively
charged
estramustine
derivatives
have
a
MAP-dependent
microtubule
inhibitory
effect
.

The
two
new
negatively
charged
derivatives
could
therefore
be
valuable
tools
in
the
study
of
tubulin-MAP
interactions
.

The
results
also
confirm
that
these
interactions
between
tubulin
and
MAPs
are
mainly
electrostatic
.

family
of
Ca
(

)
-binding
proteins
,
regulates
carcinoma
cell
motility
via
interactions
with
myosin-IIA
.

Numerous
studies
indicate
that
S100A4
is
not
simply
a
marker
for
metastatic
disease
,
but
rather
has
a
direct
role
in
metastatic
progression
.

These
observations
suggest
that
S100A4
is
an
excellent
target
for
therapeutic
intervention
.

Using
a
unique
biosensor-based
assay
,
trifluoperazine
(
TFP
)
was
identified
as
an
inhibitor
that
disrupts
the
S100A4
/
myosin-IIA
interaction
.

To
examine
the
interaction
of
S100A4
with
TFP
,
we
determined
the
2
.

A
crystal
structure
of
human
Ca
(

-S100A4
bound

.

Two
TFP
molecules
bind
within
the
hydrophobic
target
binding
pocket
of
Ca
(
2

)
-S100A4
with
no
significant
conformational
changes
observed
in
the
protein
upon
complex
formation
.

NMR
chemical
shift
perturbations
are
consistent
with
the
crystal
structure
and
demonstrate
that
TFP
binds
to
the
target
binding
cleft
of
S100A4
in
solution
.

Remarkably
,
TFP
binding
results
in
the
assembly
of
five
Ca
(
2
+
)
-S100A4
/
TFP
dimers
into
a
tightly
packed
pentameric
ring
.

Within
each
pentamer
most
of
the
contacts
between
S100A4
dimers
occurs
through
the
TFP
moieties
.

The
Ca
(
2
+
)
-S100A4
/
prochlorperazine
(
PCP
)
complex
exhibits
a
similar
pentameric
assembly
.

Equilibrium
sedimentation
and
cross-linking
studies
demonstrate
the
cooperative
formation
of
a
similarly
sized
S100A4
/
TFP
oligomer
in
solution
.

Assays
examining
the
ability
of
TFP
to
block
S100A4-mediated
disassembly
of
myosin-IIA
filaments
demonstrate
that
significant
inhibition
of
S100A4
function
occurs
only
at
TFP
concentrations
that
promote
S100A4
oligomerization
.

Together
these
studies
support
a
unique
mode
of
inhibition
in
which
phenothiazines
disrupt
the
S100A4
/
myosin-IIA
interaction
by
sequestering
S100A4
via
small
molecule-induced
oligomerization
.
A
series
of
epidemiological
,
experimental
and
preliminary
clinical
trials
strongly
suggest
that
mesalazine
or
5-aminosalicyclic
acid
(
5-ASA
)
may
have
antineoplastic
and
potentially
prophylactic
chemopreventive
properties
.

It
is
assumed
that
mesalazine
may
have
similar
genetic
and
molecular
targets
as
nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory
drugs
(
NSAIDs
)
,
which
is
further
supported
by
its
close
similarity
with
aspirin
,
differing
only
in
its
structure
by
the
presence
of
an
amino
group
at
position
5
of
the
benzene
ring
.

The
putative
chemopreventive
actions
include
the
inhibition
of
inflammatory
cascades
and
/
or
reactions
involved
in
cell
growth
and
proliferation
,
such
as
cyclo-oxygenase
(
COX-1
and
COX-2
)
,
which
regulate
cell
proliferation
through
the
formation
of
prostaglandins;
lipoxygenase;
nuclear
factor
kappaB
(
NFkappaB
)
,
responsible
for
the
subsequent
expression
of
pro-inflammatory
molecules;
MAP
kinases
and
Bcl-2
,
as
well
as
the
activation
of
apoptotic
processes
,
such
as
the
stimulation
of
intestinal
sphingomyelinase
.

The
peroxisome-proliferator-activated
receptor
delta
(
PPARdelta
)
,
which
also
regulates
gene
transcription
,
is
thought
to
play
a
role
in
both
inflammatory
and
non-inflammatory
driven
carcinogenesis
.

This
may
be
another
significant
target
.

It
is
hypothesized
that
5-ASAs
may
prevent
the
enhancing
effect
of
prostaglandins
on
PPARdelta

its

Argininosuccinate

)
catalyses
the
condensation
of
citrulline
and
aspartate
to
form
argininosuccinate
,
the
immediate
precursor
of
arginine
.

First
identified
in
the
liver
as
the
limiting
enzyme
of
the
urea
cycle
,
ASS
is
now
recognized
as
a
ubiquitous
enzyme
in
mammalian
tissues
.

Indeed
,
discovery
of
the
citrulline-NO
cycle
has
increased
interest
in
this
enzyme
that
was
found
to
represent
a
potential
limiting
step
in
NO
synthesis
.

Depending
on
arginine
utilization
,
location
and
regulation
of
ASS
are
quite
different
.

In
the
liver
,
where
arginine
is
hydrolyzed
to
form
urea
and
ornithine
,
the
ASS
gene
is
highly
expressed
,
and
hormones
and
nutrients
constitute
the
major
regulating
factors
:
(
a
)
glucocorticoids
,
glucagon
and
insulin
,
particularly
,
control
the
expression
of
this
gene
both
during
development
and
adult
life;
(
b
)
dietary
protein
intake
stimulates
ASS
gene
expression
,
with
a
particular
efficiency
of
specific
amino
acids
like
glutamine
.

In
contrast
,
in
NO-producing
cells
,
where
arginine
is
the
direct
substrate
in
the
NO
synthesis
,
ASS
gene
is
expressed
at
a
low
level
and
in
this
way
,
proinflammatory
signals
constitute
the
main
factors
of
regulation
of
the
gene
expression
.

In
most
cases
,
regulation
of
ASS
gene
expression
is
exerted
at
a
transcriptional
level
,
but
molecular
mechanisms
are
still
poorly
understood

a
new

potent

that
is
highly
selective
for

.

Its
pharmacokinetics
permit
once-daily

and
a

results
in
a
reduced
potential
for

BACKGROUND
:
Motor
vehicle
accidents
(
MVAs
)
are
a
leading
cause
of
posttraumatic
stress
disorder
(
PTSD
)
in
the
general
population
.

Alterations
in
norepinephrine
and
serotonin
systems
have
been
proposed
as
mechanisms
involved
in
the
pathophysiology
of
the
condition
,
with
treatment
directed
at
these
neurotransmitter
systems
.

Reboxetine
,
a
selective
norepinephrine
reuptake
inhibitor
,
exhibits
high
affinity
and
selectivity
for
the
human
norepinephrine
transporter
.

Inasmuch
as
PTSD
may
be
associated
with
dysregulation
of
noradrenergic
activity
,
the
present
double-blind
randomized
clinical
trial
intended
to
evaluate
reboxetine's
efficacy
in
the
management
of
MVA-related
PTSD
and
to
compare
its
efficacy
with
a
medication
commonly
used
in
PTSD
,
the
selective
serotonin
reuptake
inhibitor
fluvoxamine
.

METHODS
:
Forty
patients
with
MVA-related
PTSD
attending
a
local
community
mental
health
outpatient
clinic
were
randomized
to
receive
a
fixed
dose
of
either
reboxetine
(
8
mg
/
d
)
or
fluvoxamine
(
150
mg
/
d
)
in
a
double-blind
fashion
for
a
period
of
8
weeks
.

RESULTS
:
At
baseline
and
at
study
end
point
,
the
2
subgroups
demonstrated
no
statistical
differences
in
scores
on
PTSD
,
depression
,
and
anxiety
rating
scales
.

Both
medications
led
to
significant
improvements
in
all
clinical
scales
measured
.

Nine
patients
receiving
reboxetine
and
3
receiving
fluvoxamine
withdrew
from
the
study
because
of
side
effects
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
Study
observations
indicate
comparable
efficacy
of
reboxetine
and
fluvoxamine
in
the
management
of
MVA-related
PTSD
despite
reboxetine's
selective
noradrenergic
activity
.

Reboxetine
appears
to
be
at
least
as
effective
as
fluvoxamine
and
may
offer
an
alternative
management
option
in
this
often
difficult-to-treat
and
disabling
condition
.

A
lower
and
flexible
reboxetine
dosing
schedule
will
be
recommended
for
future
research
to
improve
its
tolerability
in
PTSD
patients
.

Two
alleles
of
the
HG1
gene
,
which
encodes
a
putative
GABA
receptor
alpha
/
gamma
subunit
,
were
isolated
from
Haemonchus
contortus
.

These
two
alleles
were
shown
previously
to
be
associated
with
ivermectin
susceptibility
(
HG1A
)
and
resistance
(
HG1E
)
,
respectively
.

Sequence
analysis
indicates
that
they
differ
in
four
amino
acids
.

To
explore
the
functional
properties
of
the
two
alleles
,
a
full-length
cDNA
encoding
the
beta
subunit
,
a
key
functional
component
of
the
GABA
receptor
,
was
isolated
from
Caenorhabditis
elegans
(
gab-1
,
corresponding
to
the
GenBank
locus
ZC482
.
1
)
and
coexpressed
in
Xenopus
oocytes
with
the
HG1
alleles
.

When
gab-1
was
coexpressed
with
either
the
HG1A
allele
or
the
HG1E
allele
in
Xenopus
oocytes
,
gamma-aminobutyric
acid
(
GABA
)
-responsive
channels
with
different
sensitivity
to
the
agonist
were
formed
.

The
effects
of
ivermectin
on
the
hetero-oligomeric
receptors
were
determined
.

Application
of
ivermectin
alone
had
no
effect
on
the
receptors
.

However
,
when
coapplied
with
10
micro
m
GABA
,
ivermectin
potentiated
the
GABA-evoked
current
of
the
GAB-1
/
HG1A
receptor
,
but
attenuated
the
GABA
response
of
the
GAB-1
/
HG1E
receptor
.

We
demonstrated
that
the
coexpressed
HG1
and
GAB-1
receptors
are
GABA-responsive
,
and
provide
evidence
for
the
possible
involvement
of
GABA
receptors
in
the
mechanism
of
ivermectin
resistance

,
an
11-amino
acid
peptide
originating
from
the
C
terminus
of
the
precursor
protein
pVI
.

There
is
a
conundrum
in
the
activation
of
AVP
in
that
AVP
and
pVI
are
sequence-independent
DNA-binding
proteins
with
nm
equilibrium
dissociation
constants
such
that
in
the
virus
particle
,
they
are
predicted
to
be
essentially
irreversibly
bound
to
the
viral
DNA
.

Here
,
we
resolve
that
conundrum
by
showing
that
activation
of
AVP
takes
place
on
the
one-dimensional
contour
of
DNA
.

In
vitro
,
pVI
,

substrate

(

/

,
until
it
binds
to
AVP
also
on
the
same
DNA
molecule
.

AVP
,
partially
activated
by
being
bound
to
DNA
,
excises
pVIc
,
which
binds
to
the
AVP
molecule
that
cut
it
out
.

pVIc
then
forms
a
disulfide
bond
with
AVP
forming
the
fully
active
AVP-pVIc
complex
bound
to
DNA
.

In
vivo
,
in
heat-disrupted
immature
virus
,
AVP
was
also
activated
by
pVI
in
DNA-dependent
reactions
.

This
activation
mechanism
illustrates
a
new
paradigm
for
virion
maturation
and
a
new
way
,
by
sliding
on
DNA
,
for
bimolecular
complexes
to
form
among
proteins
not
involved
in
DNA
metabolism

RATIONALE
:
A
substantial
body
of
research
suggests
that
the
neuropeptide
oxytocin
promotes
social
affiliative
behaviors
in
a
wide
range
of
animals
including
humans
.

However
,
its
antiaggressive
action
has
not
been
unequivocally
demonstrated
in
male
laboratory
rodents
.

OBJECTIVE
:
Our
primary
goal
was
to
examine
the
putative
serenic
effect
of
oxytocin
in
a
feral
strain
(
wild
type
Groningen
,
WTG
)
of
rats
that
generally
show
a
much
broader
variation
and
higher
levels
of
intermale
aggression
than
commonly
used
laboratory
strains
of
rats
.

METHODS
:
Resident
animals
were
intracerebroventricularly
(
icv
)
administered
with
different
doses
of
synthetic
oxytocin
and
oxytocin
receptor
antagonist
,
alone
and
in
combination
,
in
order
to
manipulate
brain
oxytocin
functioning
and
to
assess
their
behavioral
response
to
an
intruder
.

RESULTS
:
Our
data
clearly
demonstrate
that
acute
icv
administered
oxytocin
produces
dose-dependent
and
receptor-selective
changes
in
social
behavior
,
reducing
aggression
and
potentiating
social
exploration
.

These
antiaggressive
effects
are
stronger
in
the
more
offensive
rats
.

On
the
other
hand
,
administration
of
an
oxytocin
receptor
antagonist
tends
to
increase
(
nonsignificantly
)
aggression
only
in
low-medium
aggressive
animals
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
These
results
suggest
that
transiently
enhancing
brain
oxytocin
function
has
potent
antiaggressive
effects
,
whereas
its
attenuation
tends
to
enhance
aggressiveness
.

In
addition
,
a
possible
inverse
relationship
between
trait
aggression
and
endogenous
oxytocinergic
signaling
is
revealed
.

Overall
,
this
study
emphasizes
the
importance
of
brain
oxytocinergic
signaling
for
regulating
intermale
offensive
aggression
.

This
study
supports
the
suggestion
that
oxytocin
receptor
agonists
could
clinically
be
useful
for
curbing
heightened
aggression
seen
in
a
range
of
neuropsychiatric
disorders
like
antisocial
personality
disorder
,
autism
,
and
addiction
.

Podocyte
apoptosis
is
a
critical
mechanism
for
excessive
loss
of
urinary
albumin
that
eventuates
in
kidney
fibrosis
.

Pharmacological
doses
of
the
mTOR
inhibitor
rapamycin
reduce
albuminura
in
diabetes
.

We
explored
the
hypothesis
that
mTOR
mediates
podocyte
injury
in
diabetes
.

High
glucose
(
HG
)
induces
apoptosis
of
podocytes
,
inhibits
AMPK
activation
,
inactivates
tuberin
and
activates
mTOR
.

HG
also
increases
the
levels
of
Nox4
and
Nox1
and
NADPH
oxidase
activity
.

Inhibition
of
mTOR
by
low
dose
rapamycin
decreases
HG-induced
Nox4
and
Nox1
,
NADPH
oxidase
activity
and
podocyte
apoptosis
.

Inhibition
of
mTOR
had
no
effect
on
AMPK
or
tuberin
phosphorylation
indicating
that
mTOR
is
downstream
of
these
signaling
molecules
.

In
isolated
glomeruli
of
OVE26
mice
,
there
is
similar
decrease
in
the
activation
of
AMPK
and
tuberin
and
activation
of
mTOR
with
increase
in
Nox4
and
NADPH
oxidase
activity
.

Inhibition
of
mTOR
by
small
dose
of
rapamycin
reduces
podocyte
apoptosis
,
attenuates
glomerular
injury
and
albuminuria
.

Our
data
provide
evidence
for
a
novel
function
of
mTOR
in
Nox4-derived
ROS
generation
and
podocyte
apoptosis
that
contributes
to
urinary
albumin
excretion
in
type
1
diabetes
.

Thus
mTOR
and
or
NADPH
oxidase
inhibition
may
represent
a
therapeutic
modality
of
diabetic
kidney
disease
.

The

IV
(

)
contained
about
11%
of
the
normal

of
type
III
collagen
and
cultured
dermal
fibroblasts
produced
a
reduced
amount
of

was
secreted
poorly
.

Type
III
collagen
produced
by
these
cells
contained
normal
and
abnormal

and
cyanogen

peptides
.

The
site
of
the
structural
defect
in
the
abnormal
alpha
1
(
III
)
chains
was
localized
to
the
region
of
Met797
,
which
is
at
the
junction
of
the
two
carboxyl-terminal
CB5
and
CB9
cyanogen
bromide
peptides
.

Chemical
cleavage
of
heteroduplexes
formed
between
EDS-IV
mRNA
and
a
normal
cDNA
clone
covering
the
CB5
and
CB9
region
showed
that
about
100
nucleotides
were
mismatched
.

Sequencing
of
amplified
and
cloned
cDNA
spanning
the
mutant
region
revealed
a
108
nucleotide
deletion
corresponding
to
amino
acid
residues
Gly775
to
Lys810
.

The
deleted
nucleotide
sequence
corresponded
to
sequences
that
,
by
analogy
to
the
organization
of
the
type
I
collagen
genes
,
should
be
precisely
encoded
by
exon
41
of
the
COL3A1
gene
.

Sequencing
of
amplified
genomic
DNA
,
prepared
using
disimilar
amounts
of
primers
specific
for
exons
41

,
displayed
a
base
substitution
(
G-to-A
)
in
the
highly
conserved
GT
dinucleotide
of
the
5'
splice
site
of
intron
41
.

Normal
sequences
were
also
obtained
from
the
normal
allele
.

It
is
likely
that
the
GT-to-AT
transition
at
the
splice
donor
site
of
intron
41
generated
an
abnormally
spliced
mRNA
in
which
sequences
of
exon
40
and
42
were
joined
together
with
maintenance
of
the
reading
frame
.

The
corresponding
peptide
deletion
included
the
cyanogen
bromide
cleavage
site
Met797-Pro798
and
the
mammalian
collagenase
cleavage
site
at
Gly781-Ile782

There
has
been
a
steep
increase
in
the
prevalence
of
dementia
in
recent
decades
,
which
has
roughly
followed
an
increase
in
pesticide
use
some
decades
earlier
,
a
time
when
it
is
probable
that
current
dementia
patients
could
have
been
exposed
to
pesticides
.

This
raises
the
question
whether
pesticides
contribute
to
dementia
pathogenesis
.

Indeed
,
many
studies
have
found
increased
prevalence
of
cognitive
,
behavioral
and
psychomotor
dysfunction
in
individuals
chronically
exposed
to
pesticides
.

Furthermore
,
evidence
from
recent
studies
shows
a
possible
association
between
chronic
pesticide
exposure
and
an
increased
prevalence
of
dementia
,
including
Alzheimer's
disease
(
AD
)
dementia
.

At
the
cellular
and
molecular
level
,
the
mechanism
of
action
of
many
classes
of
pesticides
suggests
that
these
compounds
could
be
,
at
least
partly
,
accountable
for
the
neurodegeneration
accompanying
AD
and
other
dementias
.

For
example
,
organophosphates
,
which
inhibit
acetylcholinesterase
as
do
the
drugs
used
in
treating
AD
symptoms
,
have
also
been
shown
to
lead
to
microtubule
derangements
and
tau
hyperphosphorylation
,
a
hallmark
of
AD
.

This
emerging
association
is
of
considerable
public
health
importance
,
given
the
increasing
dementia
prevalence
and
pesticide
use
.

Here
we
review
the
epidemiological
links
between
dementia
and
pesticide
exposure
and
discuss
the
possible
pathophysiological
mechanisms
and
clinical
implications
of
this
association

The

HepaRG
has
been
recognized
as
a
promising
source
for
in
vitro
testing
of
metabolism
and
toxicity
of
compounds
.

However
,
currently
the
hepatic
differentiation
of
these
cells
relies
on
exposure
to
dimethylsulfoxide
(
DMSO
)
,
which
,
as
a
side
effect
,
has
a
cytotoxic
effect
and
represses
an
all-round
hepatic
functionality
.

The
AMC-bioartificial
liver
(
AMC-BAL
)
is
a
three-dimensional
bioreactor
that
has
previously
been
shown
to
upregulate
various
liver
functions
of
cultured
cells
.

We
therefore
cultured
HepaRG
cells
in
the
AMC-BAL
without
DMSO
and
characterized
the
drug
metabolism
.

Within
14
days
of
culture
,
the
HepaRG-AMC-BALs
contained
highly
polarized
viable
liver-like
tissue
with
heterogeneous
expression
of
CYP3A4
.

We
found
a
substantial
metabolism
of
the
tested
substrates
,
ranging
from
26%
(
UDP-glucuronosyltransferase
1A1
)
,
47%
(
CYP3A4
)
,
to
240%
(
CYP2C9
)
of
primary
human
hepatocytes
.

The
CYP3A4
activity
could
be
induced
2-fold
by
rifampicin
,
whereas
CYP2C9
activity
remained
equally
high
.

The
HepaRG-AMC-BAL
secreted
bile
acids
at
43%
the
rate
of
primary
human
hepatocytes
and
demonstrated
hydroxylation
,
conjugation
,
and
transport
of
bile
salts
.

Concluding
,
culturing
HepaRG
cells
in
the
AMC-BAL
yields
substantial
phase
1
and
phase
2
drug
metabolism
,
while
maintaining
high
viability
,
rendering
DMSO
addition
superfluous
for
the
promotion
of
drug
metabolism
.

Therefore
,
AMC-BAL
culturing
makes
the
HepaRG
cells
more
suitable

We
treated
superficial
basal
cell
carcinomas
(
BCC
)
with
imiquimod
5%
cream
daily
for
5-8
days
.

The
BCC
lesions
were
biopsied
before
treatment
and
following
imiquimod
treatment
,
when
the
lesion
showed
the
signs
of
erosion
.

We
applied
histology
,
immunohistochemistry
and
gene
array
technology
(
Affymetrix
)
to
gain
further
insight
into
the
mode
of
action
of
imiquimod
.

Our
findings
demonstrate
that
imiquimod-induced
BCC
regression
is
associated
with
a
strong
activity
of
the
innate
immune
response
,
mediated
by
cells
of

Non-selective

of

)
enzymes
(
ie
,
isoforms
A
and

)

the
brain
are
associated
with
clinically
significant
antidepressant
effects

In
the
US
,
the
selegiline

(
STS;
EMSAM
)
is
the
first
antidepressant
transdermal
delivery
system
to
receive
Food
and
Drug
Administration
(
FDA
)
approved
labeling
for
the
treatment
of
major
depressive
disorder
(
MDD
)
.

Currently
,
the
use
of
orally
administered
MAO
inhibitor
antidepressants
(
eg
,
phenelzine
,
tranylcypromine
)
is
limited
by
the
risk
of
tyramine-provoked
events
(
eg
,
acute
hypertension
and
headache
,
also
known
as
the
"cheese
reaction"
)
when
combined
with
dietary
tyramine
.

The
selegiline
transdermal
system
is
the
only
MAOI
available
in
the
US
for
the
treatment
of
MDD
that
does
not
require
dietary
restriction
at
the
clinically
effective
dose
of
6
mg
/
24
hours
.

Delivery
of
selegiline
transdermally
(
EMSAM
(
(
R
)
)
)
bypasses
hepatic
first
pass
metabolism
,
thereby
avoiding
significant
inhibition
of
gastrointestinal
and
hepatic
MAO-A
activity
(
ie
,
reduced
risk
of
tyramine-provoked
events
)
while
still
providing
sufficient
levels
of
selegiline
in
the
brain
to
produce
an
antidepressant
effect
.

At
dosages
of
6-12
mg
/
24
hours
,
EMSAM
has
been
shown
to
improve
symptoms
of
depression
,
have
good
tolerability
,
and
have
high
rates
of
medication
adherence
.

However
,
at
higher
doses
of
EMSAM
(
ie
,
9
mg
/
24
hours
or
more
)
,
dietary
restriction
of
tyramine
intake
is
recommended
.

The
introduction
of
EMSAM
overcomes
many
of
the
safety
concerns
affiliated
with
the
conventional
oral
MAO
inhibitors
and
EMSAM
may
be
considered
another
strategy
for
the
treatment
of
MDD
,
especially
in
patients
who
cannot
tolerate
oral
antidepressants
,
are
poorly
adherent
,
who
present
with
atypical
depressive
symptoms
,
or
have
failed
other
antidepressants

The
polyamines
spermidine
,
spermine
,
and
their
precursor
putrescine
are
essential
for
cell
growth
and
the
regulation
of
the
cell
cycle
.

Recent
studies
suggest
that
excessive
accumulation
of
polyamines
favors
either
malignant
transformation
or
apoptosis
,
depending
on
the
cell
type
and
the
stimulus
.

This
study
examines
the
involvement
of
polyamines
in
the
induction
of
apoptosis
by
the
DNA
topoisomerase
I
inhibitor
,
camptothecin
.

In
IEC-6

,
camptothecin
induced
apoptosis

,
accompanied
by

of

.

Detached

specific
inhibitor
of
ornithine
decarboxylase
(
ODC
)
that
is
the
first
rate-limiting
enzyme
for
polyamine
biosynthesis
,
decreased
the
apoptotic
index
.

Delayed
apoptosis
was
accompanied
by
a
decrease
in
caspase
3
activity
in
polyamine-depleted
cells
.

Addition
of
putrescine
restored
the
induction
of
apoptosis
as
indicated
by
an
increase
in
the
number
of
detached
cells
and
caspase
3
activity
.

Polyamine
depletion
did
not
change
the
level
of

S-adenosylmethionine
decarboxylase
by
a

]
led
to
depletion
of
spermidine
and
spermine
with
a
significant
accumulation
of
putrescine
and
induction
of
ODC
.

The
DEGBG-treated
cells
showed
an
increase
in
apoptosis
,
suggesting
the
importance
of
putrescine
in
the
apoptotic
process
.

Addition
of
putrescine
to
DFMO-treated
cell
extracts
did
not
increase
caspase
3
activity
.

The
above
results
indicate
that
polyamine
depletion
delays
the
onset
of
apoptosis
in
IEC-6
cells
and
confers
protection
against
DNA
damaging
agents
,
suggesting
that
polyamines
might
be
involved

Acetylcholinesterase

is
a
most
remarkable
protein
,
not
only
because
it
is
one
of
the

enzymes
in
nature
,
but
also
since
it
appears
in
many
molecular
forms
and
is

elaborate
genetic

AChE
is
expressed
in
many
tissues
during
development

in

organisms
,
as
well
as
in

states

In

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL
RELEVANCE
:
Antrodia
camphorata
(
AC
)
is
well
known
in
Taiwan
as
a
traditional
Chinese
medicinal
fungus
.

However
,
the
anticancer
activity
of
AC
against
human
HER-2
/
neu-overexpressing
ovarian
cancers
is
poorly
understood
.

MATERIALS
AND
METHODS
:
The
aim
of
this
study
is
to
investigate
whether
a
submerged
fermentation
culture
of
AC
can
inhibit
human
ovarian
carcinoma
cell
(
SKOV-3
)
proliferation
by
suppressing
the
HER-2
/
neu
signaling
pathway
.

Cell

,
HER-2

,

and
TUNEL
assays
were
carried
out
to
determine
the
anti-cancer
effects
of
AC
.

RESULTS
:
MTT
and
colony
formation
assays
showed
that
AC
induced
a
dose-dependent
reduction
in
SKOV-3
cell
growth
.

Immunoblot
analysis
demonstrated
that
HER-2
/
neu
activity
and
tyrosine
phosphorylation
were
significantly
inhibited
by
AC
.

Furthermore
,
AC
treatment
significantly
inhibited
the
activation
of
PI3K
/
Akt
and
their
downstream
effector
β-catenin
.

We
also
observed
that
AC
caused
G2
/
M

mediated
by
down-regulation
of
cyclin
D1
,
cyclin
A
,
cyclin

,
and

Notably
,

induced

was

,

and

An
increase
in
intracellular
reactive
oxygen
species
(
ROS
)
was
observed
in
AC-treated
cells
,
whereas
the
antioxidant
N-acetylcysteine
(

)
prevented
AC-induced
cell
death
,
HER-2
/
neu
depletion
,
PI3K
/

inactivation
,
and
Bcl-2
/
Bax
dysregulation
,
indicating
that
AC-induced
cell
death
was
mediated
by
ROS
generation
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
These
results
suggest
that
AC
may
exert
anti-tumor
activity
against
human
ovarian
carcinoma
by
suppressing
HER-2
/
neu
signaling
pathways
.
BACKGROUND
&
AIMS
:
It
has
been
variably
suggested
that
nonselective
NSAIDs
and
cyclooxygenase
(
COX
)
-2
selective
inhibitors
aggravate
or
ameliorate
clinical
disease
activity
in
patients
with
inflammatory
bowel
disease
.

We
assessed
the
effect
of
these
drugs
in
patients
with
inflammatory
bowel
disease
(
n
=
209
)
and
the
possible
mechanisms
.

METHODS
:
First
,
patients
with
quiescent
Crohn's
disease
and
ulcerative
colitis
received
the
non-NSAID
analgesic
acetaminophen
(
n
=
26
)
and
the
conventional
NSAIDs
naproxen
(
n
=
32
)
,
diclofenac
(
n
=
29
)
,
and
indomethacin
(
n
=
22
)
for
4
weeks
.

The
Harvey-Bradshaw
index
was
used
to
define
relapse
.

Second
,
to
assess
the
mechanism
of
relapse
,
intestinal
inflammation
was
quantitated
(
fecal
calprotectin
)
before
and
during
treatment
(
20
patients
/
group
)
with
acetaminophen
,
naproxen
(
topical
effect
,
COX-1
and
-2
inhibitor
)
,
nabumetone
(
COX-1
and
-2
inhibitor
)
,
nimesulide
(
selective
COX-2
inhibitor
)
,
and
low-dose
aspirin
(
selective
COX-1
inhibition
)
.

RESULTS
:
Nonselective
NSAIDs
were
associated
with
a
17%-28%
relapse
rate
within
9
days
of
ingestion
.

No
patient
had
an
early
relapse
on
acetaminophen
,
nimesulide
,
or
aspirin
,
whereas
those
on
naproxen
and
nabumetone
(
20%
)
experienced
relapse
.

These
clinical
relapses
were
associated
with
escalating
intestinal
inflammatory
activity
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
NSAID
ingestion
is
associated
with
frequent
and
early
clinical
relapse
of
quiescent
inflammatory
bowel
disease
,
and
the
mechanism
appears
to
be
due
to
dual
inhibition
of
the
COX
enzymes
.

Selective
COX-2
inhibition
with
nimesulide
and
COX-1
inhibition
with
low-dose
aspirin
appear
to
be
well-tolerated
in
the
short-term
.
Zearalenone
(
ZEA
,
F2
)
is
one
of
the
most
common
mycotoxins
and
the
only
known
mycoestrogen
.

It
enters
the
food
and
feed
chain
from
contaminated
cereals
and
infiltrates
into
sewage
or
natural
waters
posing
potential
threat
to
exposed
livestock
,
wildlife
and
humans
.

Therefore
evaluation
of
its
biological
effects
is
of
international
importance
.

We
performed
toxicological
tests
on
zebrafish
(
Danio
rerio
)
larvae
and
adults
.

Developmental
toxicity
was
assessed
by
an
extended
(
5
days
)
fish
embryo
toxicity
test
(
FET
)
.

Effects
of
early
ZEA
exposure
were
concentration-dependent
with
LC50
and
LC10
values
of
893
and
335μg
/
L
.

In
larvae
exposed
to
500μg
/
L
and
above
,
ZEA
induced
similar
phenotype
to
has
(
heart-and
soul
)
showing
defects
in
heart
and
eye
development
and
upward
curvature
of
the
body
axis
.

From
250μg
/
L
at
72hpf
the
gap
in
the
melanophore
streak
at
the
base
of
the
tail
fin
was
missing
and
the
fin
fold
was
abnormal
,
suggesting
disturbance
in
the
development
of
the
adult
tail
fin
primordium
.

Estrogenic
potency
was
measured
on
the
basis
of
Vitellogenin
(
Vtg
)
protein
(
adults
)
levels
and
relative
abundance
of
vitellogenin-1
mRNA
(
vtg-1
)
(
larvae
and
adults
)
.

qRT-PCR
in
larvae
proved
to
be
sufficient
substitute
to
adult
tests
and
sensitive
enough
to
detect
ZEA
in
0
.
1μg
/
L
concentrations
,
that
is
close
to
levels
observed
in
wastewaters
.

Developmental
defects
reveal
that
besides
direct
estrogenic
effects
,
zearalenone
might
interact
with
other
ontogenic
pathways
.

Alendronate
(
4-amino-1-hydroxybutylidene-1
,
1-bisphosphonate
)
is
a
potent
bisphosphonate
that
inhibits
osteoclastic
bone
resorption
and
has
proven
effective
for
the
treatment
of
osteoporosis
.

Its
molecular
mechanism
of
action
,
however
,
has
not
been
defined
precisely
.

Here
we
report
that
alendronate
is
a
potent
inhibitor
of
the
protein-tyrosine-phosphatase-meg1
(
PTPmeg1
)
.

Two
substrates
were
employed
in
this
study
:
fluorescein
diphosphate
and
the
phosphotyrosyl
peptide
src-pY527
.

With
either
substrate
,
alendronate
was
a
slow
binding
inhibitor
of
PTPmeg1
.

Among
the
other
bisphosphonates
studied
,
alendronate
was
more
potent
and
selective
for
PTPmeg1
.

The
hydrolysis
of
fluorescein
diphosphate
by
PTP
epsilon
and
PTPmeg1
was
sensitive
to
alendronate
,
with
IC50
values
of
less
than
1
microM;
PTPsigma
,
however
,
under
the
same
conditions
,
was
inhibited
by
only
50%
with
141
microM
alendronate
.

Similarly
,
with
the
src-pY527
substrate
,
alendronate
inhibition
was
also
PTP
dependent
.

Alendronate
inhibited
PTPmeg1
with
an
IC50
value
of
23
microM
,
PTPsigma
with
an
IC50
value
of
2
microM
,
and
did
not
inhibit
PTP
epsilon
at
concentrations
up
to
1
mM
.

The
alendronate
inhibition
of
these
three
PTPs
and
two
substrates
is
consistent
with
the
formation
of
a
ternary
complex
comprised
of
enzyme
,
substrate
,
and
inhibitor
.

PTP
inhibition
by
hisphosphonates
or
vanadate
was
diminished
by
the
metal
chelating
agent
EDTA
,
or
by
the
reducing
agent
dithiothreitol
,
suggesting
that
a
metal
ion
and
the
oxidation
of
a
cysteine
residue
are
required
for
full
inhibition
.

These
observations
show
substrate-
and
enzyme-specific
PTP
inhibition
by
alendronate
and
support
the
possibility
that
a
certain
PTP
(
s
)
may
be
the
molecular
target
for
alendronate
action
.
The
bone
morphogenetic
protein
(
BMP
)
signaling
pathway
has
essential
functions
in
development
,
homeostasis
,
and
the
normal
and
pathophysiologic
remodeling
of
tissues
.

Small
molecule
inhibitors
of
the
BMP
receptor
kinase
family
have
been
useful
for
probing
physiologic
functions
of
BMP
signaling
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
and
may
have
roles
in
the
treatment
of
BMP-mediated
diseases
.

Here
we
describe
the
development
of
a
selective
and
potent
inhibitor
of
the
BMP
type
I
receptor
kinases
,
LDN-212854
,
which
in
contrast
to
previously
described
BMP
receptor
kinase
inhibitors
exhibits
nearly
4
orders
of
selectivity
for
BMP
versus
the
closely
related
TGF-β
and
Activin
type
I
receptors
.

In
vitro
,
LDN-212854
exhibits
some
selectivity
for
ALK2
in
preference
to
other
BMP
type
I
receptors
,
ALK1
and
ALK3
,
which
may
permit
the
interrogation
of
ALK2-mediated
signaling
,
transcriptional
activity
,
and
function
.

LDN-212854
potently
inhibits
heterotopic
ossification
in
an
inducible
transgenic
mutant
ALK2
mouse
model
of
fibrodysplasia
ossificans
progressiva
.

These
findings
represent
a
significant
step
toward
developing
selective
inhibitors
targeting
individual
members
of
the
highly
homologous
BMP
type
I
receptor
family
.

Such
inhibitors
would
provide
greater
resolution
as
probes
of
physiologic
function
and
improved
selectivity
against
therapeutic
targets
.
Our
purpose
was
to
test
the
impact
of
single
and
/
or
combined
treatment
with
the
AT
(
1
)
-receptor
blocker
candesartan
and
the
HMG-CoA
reductase
inhibitor
rosuvastatin
on
infarct
size
and
neuroscore
in
transient
cerebral
ischemia
in
rats
.

L-NAME
was
used
to
test
whether
any
potential
effect
was
due
to
activation
of
endothelial
nitric
oxide
synthase
(
eNOS
)
.

Therefore
,
the
middle
cerebral
artery
was
occluded
for
1
h
(
MCAO
)
followed
by
7
days
reperfusion
.

Rats
received
candesartan
2h
before
and
daily
after
MCAO
(
pretreatment
)
or
daily
after
MCAO
(
posttreatment
)
;
rosuvastatin
was
given
daily
for
7
days
before
MCAO
without
or
with
candesartan
pre-
and
posttreatment
.

In
addition
,
candesartan
and
rosuvastatin
were
combined
with
L-NAME
.

Infarct
size
and
neuroscore
at
day
7
were
compared
to
those
of
controls
.

As
result
,
compared
to

or
rosuvastatin
(

was
smaller
.

Combined
treatment
also
reduced
infarct
size
(

;

;
but
there
was
no
benefit
of
combined
treatment
over
candesartan
pretreatment
alone
.

Compared
to
controls
(
2

28
)
only
candesartan
pretreatment
and
combined
treatment
improved
the

)
.

L-NAME
abolished
the
reduction
in
infarct
size
and
improvement
in
neuroscore
.

In
conclusion
,
both
,
candesartan
or
rosuvastatin
treatment
alone
reduced
infarct
size
in
transient
cerebral
ischemia
,
and
the
best
result
was
achieved
with
candesartan
pretreatment
.

Combined
treatment
was
superior
to
rosuvastatin
alone
,
but
not
to
candesartan
.

The
therapeutic
benefit
of
both
agents
was
at
least
in
parts
mediated
by
eNOS-activation

the
primary

,
and

have
been

.

The

has
shown
that
plasminogen
binds
to
all

with
the
decreasing
affinity
in
the
set
of

:

Location
of

was
performed

have
been
found
.

They
were
of
the

location
for

plasminogens
.

were
located

is

Although
interleukin
2
(
IL-2
)
and
IL-15
signal
through
the
common
gamma
chain
(
gammac
)
and
through
IL-2
receptor
beta-chain
(
CD122
)
subunits
,
they
direct
distinct
physiologic
and
immunotherapeutic
responses
in
T
cells
.

The
present
study
provides
some
insight
into
why
IL-2
and
IL-15
differentially
regulate
T-cell
function
by
revealing
that
these
cytokines
are
strikingly
distinct
in
their
ability
to
control
protein
synthesis
and
T-cell
mass
.

IL-2
and
IL-15
are
shown
to
be
equivalent
mitogens
for
antigen-stimulated
CD8
(
+
)
T
cells
but
not
for
equivalent
growth
factors
.

Antigen-primed
T
cells
cannot
autonomously
maintain
amino
acid
incorporation
or
de
novo
protein
synthesis
without
exogenous
cytokine
stimulation
.

Both
IL-2
and
IL-15
induce
amino
acid
uptake
and
protein
synthesis
in
antigen-activated
T
cells;
however
,
the
IL-2
response
is
strikingly
more
potent
than
the
IL-15
response
.

The
differential
action
of
IL-2
and
IL-15
on
amino
acid
uptake
and
protein
synthesis
is
explained
by
temporal
differences
in
signaling
induced
by
these
2
cytokines
.

Hence
,
the
present
results
show
that
cytokines
that
are
equivalent
mitogens
can
have
different
potency
in
terms
of
regulating
protein
synthesis
and
cell
growth
.

OBJECTIVE
:
To
determine
the
efficacy
and
safety
of
the
cyclooxygenase
2
(
COX-2
)
specific
inhibitor
,
rofecoxib
in
patients

the
knee
.

METHODS
:
Rofecoxib
,
25
mg
or
125
mg
once
daily
,
was
compared
with
placebo
in
a
6

study
of
219
patients

.

RESULTS
:
Both

of
rofecoxib
produced
clinically
significant
improvement
as
assessed

criteria
compared

.

Clinical
improvement
with
the
25
mg
dose
was
similar
to
that
with
the
125
mg
dose
.

Both
rofecoxib
doses
were
generally
well
tolerated
.

CONCLUSION
:
Specific
inhibition
of
COX-2
by
25
and
125
mg
rofecoxib
,
administered
once
daily
,
resulted
in
clinically
meaningful
improvements
in
patients
with
OA
.

This
study
confirms
that
COX-2
derived
prostanoids
are
important
clinical
mediators
of
pain
and
other
symptoms
of
knee
OA
and
that
inhibition
of
COX-1
is
not
required
to
provide
clinical
benefit

Neuroendocrine
tumors
are
very
heterogeneous
,
develop
from
a
variety
of
tissues
,
and
can
be
difficult
to
diagnose
.

Without
the
clinical
manifestation
of
metastases
,
it
is
often
difficult
to
characterize
them
as
malignant
.

Even
so-called
completely
(
R0
)
resected
tumors
can
spread
clinically
visible
metastases
within
a
few
months
after
initial
surgery
.

Treatment
options
for
neuroendocrine
tumors
including
pheochromocytoma
are
limited
.

Molecular
targeted
therapies
using
tyrosine
kinase
inhibitors
might
prove
to
be
helpful
in
patients
with
these
tumors
.

In
an
immunohistochemical
study
,
we
examined
KIT
in
26
pheochromocytomas
,
8
of
which
were
malignant
(
3
adrenal
pheochromocytomas
,
5
paragangliomas
)
.

KIT
expression
was
found
in
one
of
these
8
malignant
tumors
.

This
2
.
5-cm-large
adrenal
pheochromocytoma
originated
from
a
woman
with
neurofibromatosis
type
1
and
spread
into
spine
,
skull
,
and
lung
.

KIT
expression
could
be
demonstrated
in
5%
of
tumor
cells
.

On
the
basis
of
KIT
expression
immunohistochemically
,
we
treated
patients
with
neuroendocrine
(
i
.

e
.

,
medullary
thyroid
cancer
)
and
other
tumors
with
imatinib
400
mg
per
day
,
but
without
efficacy
after
2
months
of
therapy
.

Similar
results
were
shown
by
other
investigators
.

Therefore
,
monotherapy
with
imatinib
may
not
be
efficacious
in
patients
with
neuroendocrine
tumors
that
express
KIT
.

Tyrosine
kinase
inhibitors
such
as
sorafenib
that
targets
several
receptors
in
addition
to
KIT
may
be
more
efficacious
in
treating
patients
with
neuroendocrine
tumors
.

Effects
of
the
tricyclic
antidepressant
clomipramine
on
plasma
glucose
levels
in
mice
were
studied
.

Clomipramine
at
doses
ranging
5
-
20
mg
/
kg
elicited
significant
hyperglycemia
in
mice
.

Hyperglycemia
elicited
by
clomipramine
was
not
reduced
by
pretreatment
with
the
5-hydroxytryptamine
(
5-HT
)
depleter
p-chlorophenylalanine
.

The
5-HT
(
1
/
2
/

)
-receptor
antagonist
methysergide
and
the
5-HT
(
2A
/
2B
/
2C
)
-receptor
antagonist
LY

enhanced
clomipramine-induced
hyperglycemia
,
while
the
5-HT
(
1A

1B
)
-receptor
antagonist
(
-
)
-propranolol
and
the
5-HT
(
3
/
4
)
-receptor
antagonist
tropisetron
did
not
affect
it
.

The
5-HT
(
2B
/
2C
)
-receptor
antagonist
SB

facilitated
hyperglycemia
induced
by
clomipramine
,
although
the
5-HT
(
2A
)
-receptor
antagonist
ketanserin
was
without
effect
.

Clomipramine-induced
hyperglycemia
was
reduced
by
prior
adrenalectomy
.

These
results
suggest
that
clomipramine
induces
hyperglycemia
in
mice
by
blocking
the
5-HT
(
2B
)
and
/
or
5-HT
(
2C
)
receptors
,
which
results
in
facilitation
of
adrenaline
release
.
