Cyclin
E
-
cdk2
activation
is
associated
with
cell
cycle
arrest
and
inhibition
of
DNA
replication
induced
by
the
thymidylate
synthase
inhibitor
Tomudex
.

Tomudex
(
ZD1694
)
is
a
specific
antifolate
-
based
thymidylate
synthase
inhibitor
active
in
a
variety
of
solid
tumor
malignancies
.

Studies
were
carried
out
in
vitro
to
evaluate
downstream
molecular
alterations
induced
as
a
consequence
of
the
potent
and
sustained
inhibition
of
thymidylate
synthase
by
Tomudex
.

Twenty
-
four
hours
following
the
initial
2
-
h
treatment
with
Tomudex
,
human
A253
head
and
neck
squamous
carcinoma
cells
,
not
expressing
p53
and
p21
(
WAF1
)
,
were
accumulated
with
DNA
content
characteristic
of
early
S
phase
of
the
cell
cycle
with
a
concomitant
reduction
of
cells
in
G1
and
G2
/
M
phases
.

The
changes
in
cyclin
and
cdk
protein
expression
and
their
kinase
activities
were
examined
in
control
and
drug
-
treated
A253
cells
.

Tomudex
treatment
resulted
in
the
decrease
in
p27
(
kip1
)
expression
,
with
an
increase
in
cyclin
E
and
cdk2
protein
expression
and
kinase
activities
24
h
after
a
2
-
h
exposure
.

Although
cyclin
A
protein
expression
was
markedly
increased
,
cyclin
A
kinase
activity
was
only
slightly
increased
.

Cyclin
D1
,
cyclin
B
,
cdk4
,
and
cdc2
protein
expression
and
kinase
activities
remain
constant
.

Lack
of
activation
of
cyclin
A
-
and
B
-
cdc2
was
associated
with
a
reduced
proportion
of
cells
in
G2
/
M
phases
.

Increased
cyclin
E
-
cdk2
protein
expression
was
accompanied
by
the
inhibition
of
DNA
synthesis
,
with
a
decrease
in
E2F
-
1
expression
.

These
results
propose
that
cyclin
E
-
cdk2
kinase
can
negatively
regulate
DNA
replication
.

The
studies
with
dThyd
rescue
from
cyclin
E
-
cdk2
protein
overexpression
and
growth
inhibition
by
Tomudex
indicate
that
increased
cyclin
E
-
cdk2
protein
expression
is
associated
with
effective
inhibition
of
thymidylate
synthase
and
resultant
dNTP
pool
imbalance
.

Provision
of
dThyd
more
than
24
h
after
exposure
to
Tomudex
allowed
cells
to
replicate
DNA
for
a
single
cycle
back
to
G1
,
but
did
not
prevent
the
profound
growth
-
inhibitory
effect
manifested
in
the
following
5
days
.

Tomudex
treatment
resulted
in
a
time
-
dependent
induction
of
the
megabase
DNA
fragments
,
followed
by
secondary
50
-
to
300
-
kb
DNA
fragmentation
.

The
50
-
to
300
-
kb
DNA
fragmentation
may
be
derived
from
the
inhibition
of
DNA
synthesis
associated
with
cyclin
E
-
cdk2
activation
.

These
results
suggest
that
the
megabase
DNA
fragmentation
is
induced
as
a
consequence
of
inhibition
of
thymidylate
synthase
by
Tomudex
and
kilobase
DNA
fragmentation
may
correlate
with
the
reduction
of
p27
(
kip1
)
expression
and
the
increase
in
cyclin
E
and
cdk2
kinase
activities
.

Activation
of
cyclin
E
and
cdk2
kinases
allows
cells
to
transit
from
G1
to
S
phase
accompanied
by
the
inhibition
of
DNA
synthesis
.

The
changes
in
cell
cycle
regulatory
proteins
associated
with
growth
inhibition
and
DNA
damage
by
Tomudex
are
not
p53
dependent
.

New
aspects
in
the
management
of
obesity
:
operation
and
the
impact
of
lipase
inhibitors
.

Obesity
is
an
increasing
health
problem
in
most
developed
countries
and
its
prevalence
is
also
increasing
in
developing
countries
.

There
has
been
no
great
success
with
dietary
means
and
life
style
modification
for
permanent
weight
loss
.

Various
surgical
treatment
methods
for
obesity
are
now
available
.

They
are
aimed
at
limiting
oral
energy
intake
with
or
without
causing
dumping
or
inducing
selective
maldigestion
and
malabsorption
.

Based
on
current
literature
,
up
to
75
%
of
excess
weight
is
lost
by
surgical
treatment
with
concomitant
disappearance
of
hyperlipidaemias
,
type
2
diabetes
,
hypertension
or
sleep
apnoea
.

The
main
indication
for
operative
treatment
is
morbid
obesity
(
body
mass
index
greater
than
40
kg
/
m2
)
or
severe
obesity
(
body
mass
index
>
35
kg
/
m2
)
with
comorbidities
of
obesity
.

Orlistat
is
a
new
inhibitor
of
pancreatic
lipase
enzyme
.

At
doses
of
120
mg
three
times
per
day
with
meals
it
results
in
a
30
%
reduction
in
dietary
fat
absorption
,
which
equals
approximately
200
kcal
daily
energy
deficit
.

In
the
long
term
,
orlistat
has
been
shown
to
be
more
effective
than
placebo
in
reducing
body
weight
and
serum
total
and
low
-
density
lipoprotein
cholesterol
levels
.

Orlistat
has
a
lowering
effect
on
serum
cholesterol
independent
of
weight
loss
.

Along
with
weight
loss
,
orlistat
also
favourably
affects
blood
pressure
and
glucose
and
insulin
levels
in
obese
individuals
and
in
obese
type
2
diabetic
patients
.

Cyclopentenone
prostaglandins
suppress
activation
of
microglia
:
down
-
regulation
of
inducible
nitric
-
oxide
synthase
by
15
-
deoxy
-
Delta12
,
14
-
prostaglandin
J2
.

Mechanisms
leading
to
down
-
regulation
of
activated
microglia
and
astrocytes
are
poorly
understood
,
in
spite
of
the
potentially
detrimental
role
of
activated
glia
in
neurodegeneration
.

Prostaglandins
,
produced
both
by
neurons
and
glia
,
may
serve
as
mediators
of
glial
and
neuronal
functions
.

We
examined
the
influence
of
cyclopentenone
prostaglandins
and
their
precursors
on
activated
glia
.

As
models
of
glial
activation
,
production
of
inducible
nitric
-
oxide
synthase
(
iNOS
)
was
studied
in
lipopolysaccharide
-
stimulated
rat
microglia
,
a
murine
microglial
cell
line
BV
-
2
,
and
IL
-
1beta
-
stimulated
rat
astrocytes
.

Cyclopentenone
prostaglandins
were
potent
inhibitors
of
iNOS
induction
and
were
more
effective
than
their
precursors
,
prostaglandins
E2
and
D2
.

15
-
Deoxy
-
Delta12
,
14
-
prostaglandin
J2
(
15d
-
PGJ2
)
was
the
most
potent
prostaglandin
among
those
tested
.

In
activated
microglia
,
15d
-
PGJ2
suppressed
iNOS
promoter
activity
,
iNOS
mRNA
,
and
protein
levels
.

The
action
of
15d
-
PGJ2
does
not
appear
to
involve
its
nuclear
receptor
peroxisome
proliferator
-
activated
receptor
gamma
(
PPARgamma
)
because
troglitazone
,
a
specific
ligand
of
PPARgamma
,
was
unable
to
inhibit
iNOS
induction
,
and
neither
troglitazone
nor
15d
-
PGJ2
could
stimulate
the
activity
of
a
PPAR
-
dependent
promoter
in
the
absence
of
cotransfected
PPARgamma
.

15d
-
PGJ2
did
not
block
nuclear
translocation
or
DNA
-
binding
activity
of
the
transcription
factor
NFkappaB
,
but
it
did
inhibit
the
activity
of
an
NFkappaB
reporter
construct
,
suggesting
that
the
mechanism
of
suppression
of
microglial
iNOS
by
15d
-
PGJ2
may
involve
interference
with
NFkappaB
transcriptional
activity
in
the
nucleus
.

Thus
,
our
data
suggest
the
existence
of
a
novel
pathway
mediated
by
cyclopentenone
prostaglandins
,
which
may
represent
part
of
a
feedback
mechanism
leading
to
the
cessation
of
inflammatory
glial
responses
in
the
brain
.

Phospholipase
A2
inhibitors
p
-
bromophenacyl
bromide
and
arachidonyl
trifluoromethyl
ketone
suppressed
interleukin
-
2
(
IL
-
2
)
expression
in
murine
primary
splenocytes
.

Phospholipase
A2
(
PLA2
)
has
been
postulated
to
play
a
role
in
the
regulation
of
cytokine
expression
.

Therefore
,
the
objective
of
the
present
study
was
to
investigate
the
effects
of
PLA2
inhibitors
p
-
bromophenacyl
bromide
(
BPB
)
and
arachidonyl
trifluoromethyl
ketone
(
AACOCF3
)
on
interleukin
-
2
(
IL
-
2
)
expression
in
murine
primary
splenocytes
.

Pretreatment
of
the
splenocytes
with
both
BPB
and
AACOCF3
suppressed
phorbol
12
-
myristate
13
-
acetate
plus
ionomycin
-
induced
IL
-
2
secretion
in
a
concentration
-
dependent
manner
.

Inhibition
>
90
%
of
IL
-
2
secretion
was
observed
at
1
microM
BPB
and
10
microM
AACOCF3
compared
to
the
respective
vehicle
control
.

Likewise
,
IL
-
2
steady
-
state
mRNA
expression
was
inhibited
by
both
PLA2
inhibitors
in
a
concentration
-
dependent
fashion
with
>
90
%
inhibition
at
1
microM
BPB
and
20
microM
AACOCF3
.

Taken
together
,
these
data
demonstrated
that
PLA2
inhibitors
BPB
and
AACOCF3
are
robust
inhibitors
of
IL
-
2
expression
at
both
the
mRNA
and
protein
levels
in
murine
splenocytes
.

Moreover
,
these
findings
suggest
that
drugs
and
chemicals
which
inhibit
PLA2
may
have
marked
effects
on
T
-
cell
function
.

Both
5
-
HT1B
and
5
-
HT1F
receptors
modulate
c
-
fos
expression
within
rat
trigeminal
nucleus
caudalis
.

A
possible
mechanism
of
action
of
antimigraine
drugs
such
as
sumatriptan
is
inhibition
of
the
trigeminovascular
pathway
.

Sumatriptan
'
s
effects
might
be
mediated
by
5
-
HT1B
,
5
-
HT1D
or
5
-
HT1F
receptors
.

To
establish
the
relative
importance
of
these
subtypes
,
we
compared
the
effects
of
sumatriptan
with
those
of
a
selective
5
-
HT1F
receptor
agonist
(
LY
344864
)
on
c
-
fos
protein
expression
in
the
trigeminal
nucleus
caudalis
.

c
-
fos
expression
was
induced
in
urethane
-
anaesthetized
rats
by
intracisternal
capsaicin
administration
.

Sumatriptan
and
LY
344864
decreased
the
number
of
capsaicin
-
induced
c
-
fos
-
like
immunoreactive
cells
within
trigeminal
nucleus
caudalis
(
ID50
=
0
.
04
and
0
.
6
mg
kg
(
-
1
)
)
.

The
effect
of
sumatriptan
,
but
not
of
LY
344864
,
was
prevented
by
pretreatment
with
the
antagonist
SDZ
21
-
009
,
which
displays
high
affinity
for
rat
5
-
HT1B
receptors
.

LY
344864
appears
to
attenuate
c
-
fos
-
like
immunoreactivity
via
5
-
HT1F
receptors
,
while
sumatriptan
acts
via
5
-
HT1B
receptors
.

The
fact
that
activation
of
5
-
HT1F
receptors
is
sufficient
to
modulate
the
activity
of
the
trigeminal
system
suggests
that
this
receptor
may
be
a
target
for
antimigraine
drugs
with
improved
safety
profile
.

Inhibition
of
gelatinase
A
(
MMP
-
2
)
by
batimastat
and
captopril
reduces
tumor
growth
and
lung
metastases
in
mice
bearing
Lewis
lung
carcinoma
.

We
have
examined
the
effects
of
the
synthetic
matrix
metalloproteinase
inhibitor
,
batimastat
(
BB
-
94
)
and
the
angiotensin
-
converting
enzyme
inhibitor
,
captopril
,
on
metalloproteinase
activity
of
murine
Lewis
-
lung
-
carcinoma
cells
(
3LL
)
in
vitro
,
and
on
local
growth
and
lung
metastasis
of
the
same
tumor
implanted
intramuscularly
in
syngeneic
C57BL
/
6
mice
.

The
effect
of
BB
-
94
and
captopril
on
the
survival
of
the
3LL
-
tumor
-
bearing
mice
was
also
examined
.

Here
we
report
that
captopril
treatment
resulted
in
decreased
transcription
and
protein
levels
of
gelatinase
A
by
3LL
cells
.

Both
BB
-
94
and
captopril
also
prevented
substrate
degradation
by
gelatinase
A
and
B
released
in
conditioned
medium
by
cultured
cells
.

Treatment
of
tumor
-
bearing
animals
with
BB
-
94
(
i
.
p
.
)
or
captopril
(
in
drinking
water
)
resulted
in
significant
inhibition
of
the
mean
tumor
volume
(
25
and
33
%
respectively
)
and
of
the
mean
lung
metastasis
number
(
26
and
29
%
respectively
)
.

When
both
agents
were
given
,
they
acted
in
synergy
,
resulting
in
51
and
80
%
inhibition
of
tumor
growth
and
metastasis
.

The
survival
time
of
the
mice
treated
with
both
BB
-
94
and
captopril
was
also
significantly
longer
compared
with
the
groups
treated
with
each
agent
alone
or
with
the
vehicle
.

Our
data
support
the
hypothesis
of
an
essential
role
of
metalloproteinase
(
s
)
in
the
metastatic
process
.

Moreover
,
blockade
of
invasion
,
angiogenesis
and
other
processes
mediated
by
metalloproteinases
may
underlie
the
anti
-
tumor
and
anti
-
metastatic
effect
of
BB
-
94
and
captopril
and
their
combination
.

It
is
conceivable
that
this
combination
could
be
tested
in
selected
clinical
conditions
as
an
adjuvant
modality
to
cytotoxic
therapy
.

Comparison
of
inhibitory
effects
of
meloxicam
and
diclofenac
on
human
thromboxane
biosynthesis
after
single
doses
and
at
steady
state
.

OBJECTIVE
:
To
evaluate
the
extent
of
human
cyclooxygenase
-
1
(
COX
-
1
)
inhibition
by
meloxicam
,
which
has
been
reported
to
preferentially
inhibit
cyclooxygenase
-
2
(
COX
-
2
)
.

The
effects
of
meloxicam
were
compared
with
those
of
diclofenac
,
a
nonselective
COX
inhibitor
.

METHODS
:
COX
-
1
inhibition
was
determined
by
measuring
thromboxane
B2
(
TXB2
)
-
generation
from
clotting
whole
blood
ex
vivo
after
single
oral
doses
of
7
.
5
and
15
mg
meloxicam
and
75
mg
diclofenac
and
at
steady
state
(
15
mg
meloxicam
daily
and
150
mg
diclofenac
daily
)
.

The
effect
was
expressed
as
percentage
inhibition
of
serum
TXB2
generation
and
was
directly
related
to
the
serum
drug
concentration
with
use
of
a
standard
sigmoidal
E
(
max
)
model
.

RESULTS
:
In
terms
of
inhibition
of
TXB2
generation
,
diclofenac
was
about
1
order
of
magnitude
more
potent
than
meloxicam
,
indicated
by
a
diclofenac
EC50
(
concentration
of
drug
required
to
cause
50
%
of
maximum
effect
)
that
was
about
10
times
lower
than
that
of
meloxicam
(
EC50
diclofenac
single
doses
:
37
.
50
+
/
-
29
.
64
;
EC50
meloxicam
single
doses
:
677
.
50
+
/
-
189
.
08
)
.

However
,
serum
concentrations
of
meloxicam
after
administration
of
15
mg
were
approximately
10
-
fold
higher
than
those
of
diclofenac
.

Therefore
there
was
no
statistically
significant
difference
in
the
area
under
the
effect
time
curve
(
P
=
.
115
)
and
the
mean
effect
(
P
=
.
424
)
between
meloxicam
and
diclofenac
.

The
EC50
of
both
drugs
was
significantly
higher
at
steady
state
(
diclofenac
steady
state
:
87
.
07
+
/
-
55
.
24
ng
/
mL
;
meloxicam
steady
state
:
1850
.
12
+
/
-
829
.
93
ng
/
mL
)
than
after
a
single
dose
(
P
<
.
001
)
.

CONCLUSION
:
These
data
show
that
meloxicam
inhibits
TXB2
generation
at
clinically
relevant
doses
,
although
less
potently
than
diclofenac
.

Thus
our
data
suggest
that
the
COX
-
2
preference
of
meloxicam
observed
in
vitro
may
not
result
in
clinical
advantages
when
the
higher
dose
of
15
mg
is
needed
.

Because
of
the
increase
in
EC50
at
steady
state
,
COX
-
1
is
relatively
spared
when
the
lower
dose
of
7
.
5
mg
is
administered
.

Cloning

cDNA
encoding

Thus
,
PDE10A
exhibited
properties
of
a

PDE10A

were
particularly
abundant
in
the

.

The
PDE10A
gene
was
located
on

Tryptophan
hydroxylase
mRNA
levels
are
elevated
by
repeated
immobilization
stress
in
rat
raphe
nuclei
but
not
in
pineal
gland
.

Repeated
stress
triggers
a
wide
range
of
adaptive
changes
in
the
central
nervous
system
including
the
elevation
of
serotonin
(
5
-
HT
)
metabolism
and
an
increased
susceptibility
to
affective
disorders
.

To
begin
to
examine
whether
these
changes
are
mediated
by
alterations
in
gene
expression
for
tryptophan
hydroxylase
(
TPH
)
,
the
rate

biosynthesis
,
we
quantitated
its
mRNA
levels
by
competitive

-
polymerase
chain
reaction
(
RT
-
PCR
)
.

Repeated
immobilization
stress
(
2
h
,
7
days
)
elicited
a
six

or
ten
-
fold
rise
in
TPH
mRNA
in
median
raphe
nucleus
(
MRN
)
and
dorsal
raphe
nucleus
(
DRN
)
,
respectively
,
without
significantly
altering
TPH
mRNA
levels
in
the
pineal

.

In
contrast
,
there
was
little
change
in
mRNA
levels
for
GTP
cyclohydrolase

(
GTPCH
)
,
the
rate
limiting
enzyme
in
synthesis
of
the
tetrahydrobiopterin
(

)
,
the
obligate

Altered
vasoreactivity
to
angiotensin

in
experimental
diabetic

:
role
of
nitric
oxide
.

We
evaluated
the
effects
of
angiotensin
II
and
an
angiotensin
-
converting
enzyme
inhibitor
(
cilazapril
)
on
nerve
blood
flow
(
NBF
)
and
electrophysiology
in
control
and
diabetic
rats
.

When
applied
locally
to
the
sciatic
nerve
,
the
dose
-
response
curve
of
angiotensin
II
was
more
potent
in
experimental
diabetic
neuropathy
(
EDN
)
than
control
rats
.

No
difference
existed
in
plasma
angiotensin
II
levels
between
EDN
and
controls
.

The
rats
were
given
typical
rat
pellets
or
pellets
treated
with
10
mg
/
kg
per
day
cilazapril
for
4
weeks
.

Diabetes
caused
a
significant
reduction
in
NBF
,
nerve
conduction
velocity
,
and
compound
muscle
action
potential
(
CMAP
)
amplitudes
.

NBF
was
significantly
increased
in
diabetic
rats
supplemented
with
cilazapril
diet
,
and
nerve
conduction
velocity
and
amplitudes
of
the
CMAP
were
also
improved
after
4
weeks
on
this
diet
.

Direct
application
10
(
-
3
)
mol
/
L
cilazapril
on
sciatic
nerve
did
not
increase
NBF
in
normal
and
EDN
rats
.

We
topically
applied
the
nitric
oxide
synthase
(
NOS
)
inhibitor
,
NG
-
nitro
-
L
-
arginine
,
on
sciatic
nerve
and
observed
reduced
inhibition
of
NBF
in
EDN
,
which
was
correctable
with
a
cilazapril
diet
.

These
results
suggest
that
diabetic
neuropathy
may
have
an
increasing
vasopressor
action
with
angiotensin
II
and
this
is
likely
to
be
the
mechanism
of
NOS
inhibition
.

Angiotensin
II
-
converting
enzyme
inhibitors
may
have
potential
in
the
treatment
of
diabetic
neuropathy
.

In

Success
of
pyridostigmine
,
physostigmine
,
eptastigmine
and
phosphotriesterase
treatments
in
acute
sarin
intoxication
.

The
acute
toxicity
of
organophosphorus
(
OP
)
compounds
in
mammals
is
due
to
their
irreversible
inhibition
of
acetylcholinesterase
(
AChE
)
in
the
nervous
system
,
which
leads
to
increased
synaptic
acetylcholine
levels
.

The
protective

)
administered
pyridostigmine
,
physostigmine
,
eptastigmine
,
and
an
organophosphate
hydrolase
,
phosphotriesterase
,
in
acute
sarin
intoxication
were
studied
in
mice
.

The

intragastric
(

)
toxicity
(
LD50
)
of
sarin
with
and
without
the
pretreatments
was
tested
by
the
up

method
.

The
mice
received
pyridostigmine
(

administration
of
sarin
.

Physostigmine
was
also
administered
with
phosphotriesterase
.

Phosphotriesterase
was
the
most
effective
antidote
in
sarin
intoxication
.

The
LD50
value
for
sarin
increased
3
.
4
-
fold
in
mice
receiving
phosphotriesterase
.

Physostigmine
was
the
most
effective
carbamate
in
sarin
exposure
.

The
protective
ratios
of
physostigmine
and
pyridostigmine
were
1
.
5
-
and
1

3
-
fold
,
respectively
.

Eptastigmine
did
not
give
any
protection
against
sarin
toxicity
.

Both
the
phosphotriesterase
and
physostigmine
treatments
protected
the
brain
AChE
activities
measured
24
h
after
sarin
exposure
.

In
phosphotriesterase
and
physostigmine
-
treated
mice
,
a
4
-
and
2
-
fold
higher
sarin
dose
,
respectively
,
was
needed
to
cause
a
50
%
inhibition
of
brain
AChE
activity
.

Moreover
,
the
combination
of
phosphotriesterase
-
physostigmine
increased
the
LD50
value
for
sarin
4
.
3
-
fold
.

The
animals
pretreated
with
phosphotriesterase
-
ephysostigmine
tolerated
four
times
the
lethal
dose
in
control
animals
,
furthermore
their
survival
time
was
2
-
3
h
in
comparison
to
20
min
in
controls
.

In
conclusion
,
phosphotriesterase
and
physostigmine
were
the
most
effective
treatments
against
sarin
intoxication
.

However
,
eptastigmine
did
not
provide
any
protection
against
sarin
toxicity

Torasemide
inhibits
angiotensin
II
-
induced
vasoconstriction
and
intracellular
calcium
increase
in
the
aorta
of
spontaneously
hypertensive
rats
.

Torasemide
is
a
loop
diuretic
that
is
effective
at
low
once
-
daily
doses
in
the
treatment
of
arterial
hypertension
.

Because
its
antihypertensive
mechanism
of
action
may
not
be
based
entirely
on
the
elimination
of
salt
and
water
from
the
body
,
a
vasodilator
effect
of
this
drug
can
be
considered
.

In
the
present
study
,
the
ability
of
different
concentrations
of
torasemide
to
modify
angiotensin

(
Ang
II
)

vascular
responses
was
examined
,
with
the
use
of
an
organ
bath

A

The

.

Our
findings
suggest
that
torasemide
blocks
the
vasoconstrictor
action
of
Ang
II
in
vitro
.

This
action
can
be
related
to
the
ability
of
torasemide
to
block
the
increase
of
[
Ca
(
2

]
(
i
)
induced
by
Ang

in
VSMCs
.

It
is
proposed
that
these
actions
might
be
involved
in
the
antihypertensive
effect
of
torasemide
observed
in
vivo
.

Tyrosine
hydroxylase
binds
tetrahydrobiopterin
cofactor
with
negative
cooperativity
,
as
shown
by
kinetic
analyses
and
surface
plasmon
resonance
detection
.

Kinetic
studies
of
tetrameric
recombinant
human
tyrosine
hydroxylase
isoform
1
(
hTH1
)
have
revealed
properties
so
far
not
reported
for
this
enzyme
.

Firstly
,
with
the
natural
cofactor
(
6R
)
-
Lerythro
-
5
,
6
,
7
,
8
-
tetrahydrobiopterin
(
H4biopterin
)
a
time
-
dependent
change
(
burst
)
in
enzyme
activity
was
observed
,
with
a
half
-
time
of
about
20
s
for
the
kinetic
transient
.

Secondly
,
nonhyperbolic
saturation
behaviour
was
found
for
H4biopterin
with
a
pronounced
negative
cooperativity
(

58
;
[

]

.

On
phosphorylation
of
Ser40
by
protein
kinase
A
,
the
affinity
for
H4biopterin
increased
(
[
S
]
0
.
5
=
11
+
/
-
2
microM
)
and
the
negative
cooperativity
was
amplified
(
h
=
0
.
27
+
/
-
0
.
03
)
.

The
dimeric
C
-
terminal
deletion
mutant
(
Delta473
-
528
)
of
hTH1
also
showed
negative
cooperativity
of
H4biopterin
binding
(
h
=
0
.
4
)
.

Cooperativity
was
not
observed
with
the
cofactor
analogues
6
-
methyl
-
5
,
6
,
7
,
8
-
tetrahydropterin
(

and
3

methyl

5
,
6
,
7
,
8
-
tetrahydropterin
(
H43
-
methyl

)
(

0

/
-
0

1
;
Km

/

microM
)
.

In
the
presence
of
1
mM
H43
-
methyl
-
pterin
,
used
as
a
competitive
cofactor
analogue
to
BH4
,
hyperbolic
saturation
curves
were
also
found
for
H4biopterin
(
h
=
1
.
0
)
,
thus
confirming
the
genuine
nature
of
the
kinetic
negative
cooperativity
.

This
cooperativity
was
confirmed
by
real
-
time
biospecific
interaction
analysis
by
surface
plasmon
resonance
detection
.

The
equilibrium
binding
of
H4biopterin
to
the
immobilized
iron
-
free
apoenzyme
results
in
a
saturable
positive
resonance
unit
(
DeltaRU
)
response
with
negative
cooperativity
(
h
=
0
.
52
-
0
.
56
)
.

Infrared
spectroscopic
studies
revealed
a
reduced
thermal
stability
both
of
the
apo
-
and
the
holo
-
hTH1
on
binding
of
H4biopterin
and
Lerythro
-
dihydrobiopterin
(
H2biopterin
)
.

Moreover
,
the
ligand
-
bound
forms
of
the
enzyme
also
showed
a
decreased
resistance
to
limited
tryptic
proteolysis
.

These
findings
indicate
that
the
binding
of
H4biopterin
at
the
active
site
induces
a
destabilizing
conformational
change
in
the
enzyme
which
could
be
related
to
the
observed
negative
cooperativity
.

Thus
,
our
studies

[
Psychopharmacological
profile
of
venlafaxine
]
.

Venlafaxine
is
an
antidepressant
which
blocks
reuptake
of
noradrenaline
and
serotonin
and
,
to
a
lesser
extent
,
dopamine
.

These
data
have
been
confirmed
by
behavioral
tests
.

It
has
been
shown
that
by
decreasing
the
overall
cerebral
quantity
of
5
-
HT
and
NA
,
venlafaxine
continued
to
have
an
antidepressant
action
in
animal
models
.

In
addition
,
the
drug
has
been
shown
to
act
preferentially
on
5
-
HT1A
and
5
-
HT1B
receptors
.

[
Brugada
syndrome
]
.

In
1992
we
described
a
new
syndrome
consisting
of
syncopal
episodes
and
/
or
sudden
death
in
patients
with
a
structurally
normal
heart
and
a
characteristic
electrocardiogram
displaying
a
pattern
resembling
right
bundle
branch
block
with
an
ST
segment
elevation
in
leads
V1
to
V3
.

In
1998
it
was
described
that
the
disease
is
genetically
determined
with
an
autosomal
dominant
pattern
of
transmission
.

Three
different
mutations
have
been
identified
.

All
three
mutations
affect
the
structure
and
the
function
of
the
sodium
channel
SCN5A
.

Two
mutations
result
in
total
loss
of
function
of
the
sodium
channel
.

The
other
mutation
results
in
acceleration
of
the
recovery
of
the
sodium
channel
from
inactivation
.

The
disease
causes
4
to
10
sudden
deaths
per
10
,
000
inhabitants
per
year
in
areas
like
Thailand
and
Laos
.

Up
to
50
%
of
the
yearly
sudden
deaths
in
patients
with
a
normal
heart
might
be
caused
by
this
syndrome
.

The
diagnosis
is
easily
made
by
means
of
the
electrocardiogram
(
ECG
)
.

The
presence
of
concealed
and
intermittent
forms
,
however
,
makes
the
diagnosis
difficult
in
some
patients
.

The
ECG
can
be
modulated
by
changes
in
autonomic
balance
and
the
administration
of
antiarrhythmic
drugs
.

Beta
-
adrenergic
stimulation
normalises
the
ECG
,
while
i
.
v
.
ajmaline
,
flecainide
or
procainamide
accentuate
the
ST
segment
elevation
and
are
capable
of
unmasking
concealed
and
intermittent
forms
of
the
disease
.

The
prognosis
is
poor
for
patients
who
do
not
receive
an
implantable
cardioverter
-
defibrillator
.

Antiarrhythmic
drugs
like
amiodarone
or
beta
-
blockers
do
not
prevent
sudden
death
in
symptomatic
or
asymptomatic
individuals
.

Common
resistance
mechanisms
to
deoxynucleoside
analogues
in
variants
of
the
human
erythroleukaemic
line
K562
.

Resistant
variants
of
the
human
leukaemic
line
K562
were
developed
using
selection
with
the
deoxynucleoside
analogues
cytosine
arabinoside
,
2
-
chlorodeoxyadenosine
,
fludarabine
and
gemcitabine
.

The
resistant
lines
displayed
a
high
degree
of
cross
resistance
to
all
deoxynucleoside
analogues
,
with
little
or
no
cross
resistance
to
other
agents
.

There
was
a
profound
accumulation
defect
of
all
nucleoside
analogues
in
the
resistant
variants
but
no
significant
defect
in
nucleoside
transport
in
any
of
the
variants
.

5
'
nucleotidase
activity
was
strongly
increased
and
deoxycytidine
kinase
activity
was
moderately
reduced
in
all
of
the
resistant
variants
,
resulting
in
reduced
accumulation
of
triphosphate
analogues
.

In
addition
a
deletion
in
one
of
the
alleles
of
the
deoxycytidine
kinase
was
detected
in
the
fludarabine
-
resistant
line
.

Ribonucleotide
reductase
activity
was
found
to
be
strongly
increased
in
the
gemcitabine
-
selected
line
and
purine
nucleoside
phosphorylase
was
increased
in
the
2
-
chlorodeoxyadenosine
-
selected
line
.

Free
nucleotide
pools
were
increased
in
the
2
-
chlorodeoxyadenosine
-
selected
line
.

There
was
no
expression
of
the
mdr1
gene
by
the
resistant
lines
.

Karyotypic
analysis
and
FISH
experiments
using
a
6q21
specific
probe
showed
alterations
in
the
6
(
q16
-
q22
)
region
which
contains
the
5
'
-
nucleotidase
gene
.

Early
events
in
the
activation
and
degradation
of
deoxynucleoside
analogues
appear
to
constitute
common
mechanisms
of
resistance
to
these
compounds
.

Angiotensin
-
converting
enzyme
inhibition
and
AT1
receptor
blockade
modify
the
pressure
-
natriuresis
relationship
by
additive
mechanisms
in
rats
with
human
renin
and
angiotensinogen
genes
.

The
intrarenal
factors
responsible
for
hypertension
in
double
-
transgenic
rats
(
dTGR
)
harboring
human
renin
and
human
angiotensinogen
genes
are
unclear
.

The
pressure
-
natriuresis
and
-
diuresis
relationships
in
response
to
chronic
angiotensin
-
converting
enzyme
(
ACE
)
inhibition
and
AT1
receptor
blockade
were
evaluated
.

Renal
renin
-
angiotensin
and
nitric
oxide
(
NO
)
system
gene
expression
was
also
investigated
.

Six
-
week
-
old
dTGR
were
treated
for
3
wk
with
submaximal
doses
of
cilazapril
(
10
mg
/
kg
,
orally
)
or
losartan
(
10
mg
/
kg
,
orally
)
or
with
the
drug
combination
.

In
untreated
dTGR
,
pressure
-
natriuresis
relationships
were
maximally
shifted
rightward
by
approximately
70
to
80
mmHg
,
and
both
renal
blood
flow
(
RBF
)
and
GFR
were
markedly
decreased
.

Submaximal
cilazapril
and
losartan
dosages
both
decreased
systolic
BP
by
30
mmHg
and
shifted
the
pressure
-
natriuresis
curves
leftward
by
25
to
30
mmHg
.

Cilazapril
increased
RBF
and
GFR
to
values
observed
in
normotensive
control
animals
but
did
not
significantly
affect
fractional
sodium
excretion
(
FENa
)
or
fractional
water
excretion
(
FEH2O
)
curves
.

In
contrast
,
losartan
had
no
significant
effect
on
RBF
or
GFR
but
shifted
the
FENa
and
FEH2O
curves
leftward
.

The
cilazapril
and
losartan
combination
completely
normalized
BP
and
shifted
the
pressure
-
natriuresis
curves
leftward
more
than
did
either
drug
alone
.

When
cilazapril
and
losartan
were
administered
at
higher
doses
(
30
mg
/
kg
,
orally
)
,
the
two
drugs
equally
shifted
the
pressure
-
natriuresis
curves
leftward
,
by
50
mmHg
.

Both
drugs
increased
RBF
and
GFR
;
however
,
only
losartan
shifted
FENa
and
FEH2O
curves
leftward
.

Human
and
rat
renin
and
angiotensinogen
genes
were
downregulated
in
dTGR
and
were
increased
by
losartan
and
cilazapril
treatments
,
whereas
no
changes
in
the
expression
of
rat
ACE
and
AT1A
receptor
genes
were
observed
.

Endothelial
NO
synthase
expression
was
increased
by
cilazapril
but
not
by
losartan
.

Neither
inducible
NO
synthase
nor
neural
NO
synthase
gene
expression
was
affected
by
drug
treatments
.

Therefore
,
submaximal
ACE
inhibition
enhanced
sodium
excretion
mainly
by
increasing
RBF
and
GFR
,
whereas
submaximal
AT1
receptor
blockade
decreased
tubular
sodium
and
water
reabsorption
.

The
combination
of
the
two
drugs
produced
an
additive
effect
.

The
ACE
inhibitor
effects
may
involve
increased
endothelial
NO
synthase
expression
,
perhaps
related
to
the
inhibition
of
bradykinin
degradation
.

Effects
of

5
-
HT
and
noradrenaline
in
the

.

Venlafaxine
is
a
novel
serotonin

noradrenaline
reuptake
inhibitor
(
SNRI
)
which
has
been
shown
clinically
to
be
an
effective
antidepressant
(
AD
)
with
a
faster
onset
of
action
than
serotonin
specific
reuptake
inhibitors
(
SSRI
)
.

Preclinically
,
venlafaxine
has
been
shown
to
potently
inhibit
dorsal
raphe
neuronal
(
DRN
)
firing
through
a
5
-
HT1A
mediated
mechanism
,
in
a
similar
manner
to
SSRIs
.

Here
we
demonstrate
the
acute
neurochemical
effects
of
venlafaxine
on
extracellular
concentrations
of
5
-
HT
and
noradrenaline
(
NA
)
from
the
rat

.

Administration

)
resulted
in
a
significant

but
produced
no

at
doses
as
low
as

maintained

)
pindolol
and
the

GR127935
produced
no

Using
the

,
we
also
demonstrate
the
role
of

B
,
an
ansamycin
antibiotic
,
on
the
function
of

B
)
,
an
ansamycin
isolated
from
fermentation
broths
of
Streptomyces

,
inhibited
the
growth
in

of
human

cells
over
10
times
more
strongly
than
the
growth
of

cells
,
such
as
HeLa
(
cervix
)
,
T24
(

and

(

.

The
extent
of
growth
inhibition
by
TT
-
B
of
SC
-
6
,
but
not
of
LX
-
1
nor
T24
,
was
lowered
in
a
competitive
manner
by
raising
serum
concentrations
in
the
culture
medium
.

TT

B
inhibited
the
cell
cycle
progression
of
SC
-
6
at
an
early
stage
of
the
progression
from
G0
/
G1
to
S
.

The
inhibition
was
again
competitive
with
serum
concentrations
in
the
culture
medium
.

No
direct
inhibition
of
DNA
synthesis
was
observed
at
the
concentration
range
which
caused
the
cell

arrest
.

TT

to
each

in
inhibiting
the

6
from
G0

S
,
suggesting
that
the
two

Structural
basis
for
LFA
-
1
inhibition
upon
lovastatin
binding
to
the
CD11a
I
-
domain
.

The
lymphocyte
function
-
associated
antigen
(
LFA
-
1
)
belongs
to
the
family
of
beta2
-
integrins
and
plays
an
important
role
in
T
-
cell
activation
and
leukocyte
migration
to
sites
of
inflammation
.

We
report
here
that
lovastatin
,
a
drug
clinically
used
for
lowering
cholesterol
levels
,
inhibits
the
interaction
of
human
LFA
-
1
with
its
counter
-
receptor
intercellular
adhesion
molecule
-
1
.

Using
nuclear
magnetic
resonance
spectroscopy
and
X
-
ray
crystallography
we
show
that
the
inhibitor
binds
to
a
highly
conserved
domain
of
the
LFA
-
1
alpha
-
chain
called
the
I
-
domain
.

The
first
three
-
dimensional
structure
of
an
integrin
inhibitor
bound
to
its
receptor
reveals
atomic
details
for
a
hitherto
unknown
mode
of
LFA
-
1
inhibition
.

It
also
sheds
light
into
possible
mechanisms
of
LFA

1
mediated
signalling
and
will
support
the
design
of
novel
anti

.

Threshold
concentrations
of
endothelin
-
1
:
the
effects
on
contractions
induced
by
5
-
hydroxytryptamine
in
isolated
rat
cerebral
and
mesenteric
arteries
.

This
study
compares
the
effects
of
threshold
concentrations
of
endothelin
-
1
in
isolated
rat
basilar
arteries
with
those
in
mesenteric
arterial
branches
and
investigates
the
mechanisms
of
inhibitory
and
potentiating
endothelin
-
1
-
effects
.

In
basilar
arteries
,
endothelin
-
1
reduces
the
contractions
induced
by
5
-
hydroxytryptamine
(
5
-
HT
)
,
by
the
thromboxane
A2
agonist
U46619
,
and
by
vasopressin
.

The
inhibitory
effect
of
endothelin
-
1
on
the
contraction
induced
by
5
-
HT
is
abolished
by
deendothelialization
,
by
the
endothelin
ET
(
B
)
receptor
antagonist
RES
701
-
1
,
by
indomethacin
,
or
by
glibenclamide
.

In
mesenteric
arteries
,
endothelin
-
1
potentiates
the
contractile
effects
of
5
-
HT
,
U46619
,
and
vasopressin
.

The
potentiation
of
the
contractile
effect
induced
by
5
-
HT
is
only
somewhat
modified
by
deendothelialization
,
but
abolished
by
the
thromboxane
A2
receptor
antagonists
GR32191
and
ridogrel
.

U46619
potentiates
the
5
-
HT
-
effect
in
mesenteric
arteries
.

Thus
,
though
the
contractile
endothelin
ET
(
A
)
receptors
were
not
blocked
,
threshold
concentrations
of
endothelin
-
1
inhibited
contractile
effects
in
the
rat
basilar
artery
via
activation
of
endothelial
ET
(
B
)
receptors
.

Prostaglandins
and
ATP
-
sensitive
K
+
channels
are
involved
in
this
inhibitory
action
.

In
contrast
,
endothelin
-
1
potentiates
contractile
actions
in
mesenteric
arteries
via
the
release
of
endogeneous
thromboxane
A2
from
non
-
endothelial
cells
.

The
study
points
out
the
completely
different
role
of
the
endothelium
in
combined
effects
of
endothelin
-
1
between
cerebral
and
mesenteric
arteries
.

Synthesis
and
antagonistic
activity
at
muscarinic
receptor
subtypes
of
some
2
-
carbonyl
derivatives
of
diphenidol
.

A
series
of
2
-
carbonyl
analogues
of
the
muscarinic
antagonist
diphenidol
bearing
1
-
substituents
of
different
lipophilic
,
electronic
,
and
steric
properties
was
synthesized
and
their
affinity
for
the
M2
and
M3
muscarinic
receptor
subtypes
was
evaluated
by
functional
tests
.

Two
derivatives
(
2g
and
2d
)
showed
an
M2
-
selective
profile
which
was
confirmed
by
functional
tests
on
the
M1
and
M4
receptors
.

A
possible
relationship
between
M2
selectivity
and
lipophilicity
of
the
1
-
substituent
was
suggested
by
structure
-
activity
analysis
.

This
work
showed
that
appropriate
structural
modification
of
diphenidol
can
lead
to
M2
-
selective
muscarinic
antagonists
of
possible
interest
in
the
field
of

Chloride
channels
in
renal
disease
.

Recent
studies
of
hereditary
renal
tubular
disorders
have
facilitated
the
identification
and
roles
of
chloride
channels
and
cotransporters
in
the
regulation
of
the
most
abundant
anion
,
Cl
-
,
in
the
ECF
.

Thus
,
mutations
that
result
in
a
loss
of
function
of
the
voltage
-
gated
chloride
channel
,
CLC
-
5
,
are
associated
with
Dent
'
s
disease
,
which
is
characterized
by
low
-
molecular
weight
proteinuria
,
hypercalciuria
,
nephrolithiasis
,
and
renal
failure
.

Mutations
of
another
voltage
-
gated
chloride
channel
,
CLC
-
Kb
,
are
associated
with
a
form
of
Bartter
'
s
syndrome
,
whereas
other
forms
of
Bartter
'
s
syndrome
are
caused
by
mutations
in
the
bumetanide
-
sensitive
sodium
-
potassium
-
chloride
cotransporter
(
NKCC2
)
and
the
potassium
channel
,
ROMK
.

Finally
,
mutations
of
the
thiazide
-
sensitive
sodium
-
chloride
cotransporter
(
NCCT
)
are
associated
with
Gitelman
'
s
syndrome
.

These
studies
have
helped
to
elucidate
some
of
the
renal
tubular
mechanisms
regulating
mineral
homeostasis
and
the
role
of
chloride
channels
.

in
essential
hypertension
.

BACKGROUND
:
In
essential
hypertension
an
elevated
renal
vascular
resistance
(
RVR
)
may
be
a
marker
of
renin
-
angiotensin
-
aldosterone
system
-
mediated
impairment
of
renal
sodium
excretion
.

This
hypothesis
was
tested
by
investigating
whether
,
in
subjects
with
essential
hypertension
,
the
natriuretic
response
to
specific
renin
-
angiotensin
-
aldosterone
system
(
RAAS
)
blockade
by
renin
-
inhibitor
remikiren
could
be
predicted
from
pretreatment
renal
vascular
tone
.

MATERIALS
AND
METHODS
:
Renal
hemodynamics
,
and
the
effects
of
single
(
n
=
17
)
and
multiple
doses
(
n
=
8
,
8
days
)
of
remikiren
(
600
mg
day
-
1
)
on
sodium
excretion
were
studied
under
conditions
of
carefully
controlled
sodium
balance
.

RESULTS
:
Pretreatment
renal
vascular
tone
showed
considerable
individual
differences
:
filtration
fraction
(
FF
)
ranged
from
21
.
2
to
30

3
%
and
RVR
from

in
the
multiple

.

Remikiren
induced
a
fall
in
blood
pressure
,
FF
and
RVR
,
with
considerable
interindividual
variability
in
natriuretic
response
.

During
single
dose
,
cumulative
sodium
loss
was
5
.
1
mmol
per
5
h
(

)
,
whereas
after
8
days
treatment
cumulative
sodium
loss
was
72
+
/
-
30
mmol
(
-
46
to

187
)
.

The
natriuretic
response
to
remikiren
during
single
as
well
as
multiple
dose
significantly
correlated
with
pretreatment
renal
vascular
tone
(
estimated
from
FF
and
RVR
)
but
not
with
remikiren
-
induced
changes
in
renal
hemodynamics
or
in
hormonal
parameters
.

Cumulative
sodium
loss
was
largest
in
patients
with
a
higher
pretreatment

and
RVR
(

CONCLUSION
:
These
data
support
the
hypothesis
that
in

an
elevated
renal

is
a
marker
of

Structure

A

.

(

)
-
Galanthamine
(
GAL
)
,
an
alkaloid
from
the
flower
,
the
common
snowdrop
(
Galanthus
nivalis
)
,
shows
anticholinesterase
activity
.

This
property
has
made
GAL
the
target
of
research
as
to
its
effectiveness
in
the
treatment
of
Alzheimer
'
s
disease
.

We
have
solved
the
X
-
ray
crystal
structure
of
GAL
bound
in
the
active
site
of
Torpedo
californica
acetylcholinesterase
(
TcAChE
)
to
2
.
3
A
resolution
.

The
inhibitor
binds
at
the
base
of
the
active
site
gorge
of
TcAChE
,
interacting
with
both
the
choline
-
binding
site
(
Trp
-
84
)
and
the
acyl
-
binding
pocket
(
Phe
-
288
,
Phe
-
290
)
.

The
tertiary
amine
group
of
GAL
does
not
interact
closely
with
Trp
-
84
;
rather
,
the
double
bond
of
its
cyclohexene
ring
stacks
against
the
indole
ring
.

The
tertiary
amine
appears
to
make
a
non
-
conventional
hydrogen
bond
,
via
its
N
-
methyl
group
,
to
Asp
-
72
,
near
the
top
of
the
gorge
.

The
hydroxyl
group
of
the
inhibitor
makes
a
strong
hydrogen
bond
(
2
.
7
A
)
with
Glu
-
199
.

The
relatively
tight
binding
of
GAL
to
TcAChE
appears
to
arise
from
a
number
of
moderate
to
weak
interactions
with
the
protein
,
coupled
to
a
low
entropy
cost
for
binding
due
to
the
rigid
nature
of
the
inhibitor
.

Preferential
block
of
late
sodium
current
in
the
LQT3
DeltaKPQ
mutant
by
the
class
I
(
C
)
antiarrhythmic
flecainide
.

Flecainide
block
of
Na
(
+
)
current
(
I
(
Na
)
)
was
investigated
in
wild
-
type
(
WT
)
or
the
long
QT
syndrome
3
(
LQT3
)
sodium
channel
alpha
subunit
mutation
with
three
amino
acids
deleted
(
DeltaKPQ
)
stably
transfected
into
human
embryonic
kidney
293
cells
using
whole
-
cell
,
patch
-
clamp
recordings
.

Flecainide
(
1
-
300
mM
)
caused
tonic
and
use
-
dependent
block
(
UDB
)
of
I
(
Na
)
in
a
concentration
-
dependent
manner
.

Compared
with
WT
,
DeltaKPQ
I
(
Na
)
was
more
sensitive
to
flecainide
,
and
flecainide
preferentially
inhibited
late
I
(
Na
)
(
mean
current
between
20
and
23
.
5
ms
after
depolarization
)
compared
with
peak
I
(
Na
)
.

The
IC
(
50
)
value
of
peak
and
late
I
(
Na
)
for
WT
was
127
+
/
-
6
and
44
+
/
-
2
microM
(
n
=
20
)
and
for
DeltaKPQ
was
80
+
/
-
9
and
19
+
/
-
2
microM
(
n
=
31
)
respectively
.

UDB
of
peak
I
(
Na
)
was
greater
and
developed
more
slowly
during
pulse
trains
for
DeltaKPQ
than
for
WT
.

The
IC
(
50
)
value
for
UDB
of
peak
I
(
Na
)
for
WT
was
29
+
/
-
4
microM
(
n
=
20
)
and
for
DeltaKPQ
was
11
+
/
-
1
microM
(
n
=
26
)
.

For
DeltaKPQ
,
UDB
of
late
I
(
Na
)
was
greater
than
for
peak
I
(
Na
)
.

Recovery
from
block
was
slower
for
DeltaKPQ
than
for
WT
.

We
conclude
that
DeltaKPQ
interacts
differently
with
flecainide
than
with
WT
,
leading
to
increased
block
and
slowed
recovery
,
especially
for
late
I
(
Na
)
.

These
data
provide
insights
into
mechanisms
for
flecainide
block
and
provide
a
rationale
at
the
cellular
and
molecular
level
that
open
channel
block
may
be
a
useful
pharmacological
property
for
treatment
of
LQT3
.

Synergistic
effects
of
new
chemopreventive
agents
and
conventional
cytotoxic
agents
against
human
lung
cancer
cell
lines
.

Non
-
small
cell
lung
cancer
(
NSCLC
)
cells
have
constitutively
high
expression
of
cytosolic
phospholipase
A2
(
cPLA2
)
and
cyclooxygenase
(
COX
)
2
.

These
NSCLC
cells
also
have
increased
prostaglandin
expression
(
PGE2
)
.

Many
lung
cancers
also
express
12
-
lipoxygenase
RNA
and
12
-
lipoxygenase
protein
and
biosynthesize
12
(
S
)
-
hydroxyeicosatetraenoic
acid
,
which
correlates
with
their
metastatic
potential
.

Several
studies
have
demonstrated
that
COX
-
1
and
COX
-
2
inhibitors
could
inhibit
the
in
vitro
growth
of
human
lung
cancer
cell
lines
.

In
this
report
,
we
evaluated
the
growth
-
inhibitory
effects
of
sulindac
sulfide
,
a
COX
-
1
and
COX
-
2
inhibitor
;
exisulind
(
sulindac
sulfone
)
,
a
novel
proapoptotic
agent
that
does
not
inhibit
COX
enzymes
;
and
nordihydroguaiaretic
acid
(
NDGA
)
,
a
lipoxygenase
inhibitor
on
human
lung
cancer
cell
lines
.

We
compared
these
effects
with
those
of
13
-
cis
-
retinoic
acid
,
a
chemoprevention
agent
,
and
with
the
cytotoxic
chemotherapeutic
agents
paclitaxel
and
cisplatin
,
alone
or
in
combination
.

Our
goal
was
to
develop
new
chemoprevention
and
treatment
strategies
.

Each
of
the
six
agents
tested
inhibited
the
in
vitro
growth
of
three
NSCLC
and
three
SCLC
cell
lines
at
the
highest
concentration
.

Paclitaxel
was
the
most
potent
agent
(
IC50
=
0
.
003
-
0
.
150
microM
)
;
sulindac
sulfide
,
NDGA
,
and
13

cis
-
retinoic
acid
had
intermediate
potency
(
IC50
=
4
-
80
microM
)
,
and
cisplatin
and
exisulind
were
the
least
potent
(
IC50
=
150
-
500
microM
)
.

Combination
studies
showed
synergistic
interactions
for
sulindac
sulfide
,
exisulind
,
and
NDGA
with
paclitaxel
,
cisplatin
,
and
13
-
cis
-
retinoic
acid
,
regardless
of
drug
-
resistance
phenotype
.

At
high
concentrations
,
the
combination
of
13
-
cis
-
retinoic
acid
and
each
of
the
five
other
drugs
resulted
in
a
strong
synergistic
effect
.

These
studies
provide
a
rationale
for
chemoprevention
(
exisulind
+
/
-
retinoic

)
and

Lithium
modulates

Analysis
of

of
the

expressed
in

has
shown
that
lithium
produces
a

suggested
that

further
confirms
that
lithium
enhances

responses
by
reducing

,
since

Lithium

on

are
distinct

Specifically
,
aniracetam

is
ineffective
on

showed
no

on
the

thereby
indicating
that
PGE1

inhibition
of
the

channels
is
possibly
mediated
by
the

The

was

in
the

not
with

of

that

are
involved

The
inhibitory
effect
of
PGE1

was
prevented
by

and
the

of

.

It
was
concluded
that
PGE1
selectively
reduces
both
N

currents
by
activating
a
G

[
Effect
of
mifepristone
on
the
expression
of
progesterone
receptor
messenger
RNA
and
protein
in
uterine
leiomyomata
]
.

OBJECTIVE
:
To
determine
the
expression
of
progesterone
receptor
(
PR
)
mRNA
and
PR
protein
levels
in
the
myometrium
and
leiomyomata
from
untreated
and
mifepristone
pretreated
women
with
leiomyoma
and
to
examine
the
mechanism
of
mifepristone
treatment
on
uterine
leiomyomata
.

METHODS
:
Expression
of
PR
mRNA
and
PR
protein
were
determined
by
Northern
blot
and
HAP
of
single
-
dose
saturated
analysis
in
myometrium
and
leiomyomata
(
center
and
marginal
area
)
from
27
untreated
and
6
mifepristone
pretreated
women
with
leiomyomata
.

RESULTS
:
PR
mRNA
abundance
and
PR
protein
levels
in
both
myomatous
center
and
marginal
area
were
significantly
greater
than
those
in
corporal
myometrium
(
P
<
0
.
01
)
in
both
follicular
and
luteal
phases
,
but
similar
between
myomatous
center
and
marginal
area
(
P
>
0
.
05
)
.

6
cases
pretreated
with
mifepristone
25
mg
/
day
for
3
months
were
operated
,
all
but
one
patient
displayed
a
decrease
in
leiomyomata
volume
.

PR
mRNA
abundance
in
both
myometruim
and
leiomyomata
(
center
and
marginal
area
)
was
significantly
decreased
in
4
patients
continuing
mifepristone
treatment
before
the
operation
but
not
in
the
other
2
patients
stopping
RU486
1
month
before
operation
.

PR
protein
levels
in
these
tissues
showed
significant
decrease
in
all
6
cases
.

CONCLUSION
:
There
are
overexpression
of
PRmRNA
and
PR
protein
in
leiomyomata
.

One
of
the
mechanism
of
mifepristone
action
on
decreasing
leiomyomata
volume
may
be
related
to
suppression
on
expression
of
PR
gene
.

It
seems
that
suppression
on
transcription
of
PR
gene
is
reversible
,
but
on
translation
of
PR
gene
may
maintain
in
a
relatively
longer
period
.

The
anticonvulsant
felbamate
blocks
N
-
methyl
-

-
asparate
(
NMDA
)
receptors
but
fails
to
exhibit
the
neurobehavioral
toxicity
characteristic
of
other
NMDA
receptor
antagonists
.

To
investigate
the
possibility
that
felbamate
'
s
favorable
toxicity
profile
could
be
related
to
NMDA
receptor
subtype
selectivity
,
we
examined
the
specificity
of
felbamate
block
of
recombinant
NMDA
receptors
composed
of
the
NR1a
subunit
and
various
NR2
subunits
.

Felbamate
produced
a
rapid
,
concentration
-
dependent
block
of
currents
evoked
by
50
microM
NMDA
and
10
microM
glycine
in
human
embryonic
kidney
293
cells
expressing
the
rat
NR1a
subunit
,
and
either
the
NR2A
,
NR2B
or
NR2C
subunits
;
the
IC50
values
for
block
were
2
.
6
,
0
.
52
and
2
.
4
mM
,
respectively
(
holding
potential
,
-
60
mV
)
.

The
Hill
coefficient
values
were
<
1
and
,
in
kinetic
analyses
,
onset
and
recovery
from
block
were
well
fit
by
double
exponential
functions
,
indicating
binding
to
more
than
one
blocking
site
on
the
NMDA
receptor
channel
complex
.

The
higher
affinity
of
felbamate
block
of
NMDA
receptors
containing
the
NR2B
subunit
could
be
accounted
for
by
more
rapid
association
and
slower
dissociation
from
these
sites
.

We
conclude
that
felbamate
exhibits
modest
selectivity
for
NMDA
receptors
composed
of
NR1a
/
NR2B
subunits
.

This
selectivity
could
,
in
part
,
account
for
the
more
favorable
clinical
profile
of
felbamate
in
comparison
with
NMDA
receptor
antagonists
that
do
not
show
subunit
selectivity
.

.

OBJECTIVE
:
This
randomized
,
double
-
blind
study
tested
the
hypothesis
that
rofecoxib
,
a
drug
that
specifically
inhibits
cyclooxygenase
2
,
would
cause
fewer
gastroduodenal
ulcers
than
ibuprofen
(
in
a
multicenter
trial
)
,
and
its
side
effects
would
be
equivalent
to
those
of
placebo
(
in
a
prespecified
analysis
combining
the
results
with
another
trial
of
identical
design
)
.

METHODS
:
Seven
hundred
seventy
-
five
patients
with
osteoarthritis
were
randomized
to
receive
rofecoxib
at
a
dosage
of
25
mg
or
50
mg
once
daily
,
ibuprofen
800
mg
3
times
daily
,
or
placebo
.

Gastroduodenal
ulceration
was
assessed
by
endoscopy
at
6
,
12
,
and
(
for
active
treatment
)
24
weeks
.

The
primary
and
secondary
end
points
were
the
incidence
of
gastroduodenal
ulcers
at
12
and
24
weeks
,
respectively
.

RESULTS
:
Ulcers
were
significantly
less
common
(
P
<
0
.
001
)
following
treatment
with
rofecoxib
(
25

)
than
with
ibuprofen
after
12
weeks
(
5

.
9
%
and
12
.
4
%
versus
46

respectively
)
.

In
the
combined
analysis
,
the
12

ulcer
incidence
with
25
mg
rofecoxib
(
4
.
7
%
)
and
with
placebo
(

)
satisfied
prespecified
criteria
for
equivalence
.

CONCLUSION
:
At
2
-
4
times
the
therapeutically
effective
dose
,
rofecoxib
caused
fewer
endoscopically
detected
ulcers
than
did
ibuprofen
.

Rofecoxib
at
a
dose
of
25
mg
(
the
highest
dose
recommended
for
osteoarthritis
)
satisfied
prespecified
criteria
for
equivalence
to
placebo
.

SPACRCAN
,
a
novel
human
interphotoreceptor
matrix
hyaluronan
-
binding
proteoglycan
synthesized
by
photoreceptors
and
pinealocytes
.

The
interphotoreceptor
matrix
is
a
unique
extracellular
complex
occupying
the
interface
between
photoreceptors
and
the
retinal
pigment
epithelium
in
the
fundus
of
the
eye
.

Because
of
the
putative
supportive
role
in
photoreceptor
maintenance
,
it
is
likely
that
constituent
molecules
play
key
roles
in
photoreceptor
function
and
may
be
targets
for
inherited
retinal
disease
.

In
this
study
we
identify
and
characterize
SPACRCAN
,
a
novel
chondroitin
proteoglycan
in
this
matrix
.

SPACRCAN
was
cloned
from
a
human
retinal
cDNA
library
and
the
gene
localized
to
chromosome
3q11
.
2
.

Analysis
of
SPACRCAN
mRNA
and
protein
revealed
that
SPACRCAN
is
expressed
exclusively
by
photoreceptors
and
pinealocytes
.

SPACRCAN
synthesized
by
photoreceptors
is
localized
to
the
interphotoreceptor
matrix
where
it
surrounds
both
rods
and
cones
.

The
functional
protein
contains
1160
amino
acids
with
a
large
central
mucin
domain
,
three
consensus
sites
for
glycosaminoglycan
attachment
,
two
epidermal
growth
factor
-
like
repeats
,
a
putative
hyaluronan
-
binding
motif
,
and
a
potential
transmembrane
domain
near
the
C
-
terminal
.

Lectin
and
Western
blotting
indicate
an
M
(
r
)
around
400
,
000
before
and
230
,
000
after
chondroitinase
ABC
digestion
.

Removal
of
N
-
and
O
-
linked
oligosaccharides
reduces
the
M
(
r
)
to
approximately
160
,
000
,
suggesting
that
approximately
60
%
of
the
mass
of
SPACRCAN
is
carbohydrate
.

Finally
,
we
demonstrate
that
SPACRCAN
binds
hyaluronan
and
propose
that
associations
between
SPACRCAN
and
hyaluronan
may
be
involved
in
organization
of
the
insoluble
interphotoreceptor
matrix
,
particularly
as
SPACRCAN
is
the
major
proteoglycan
present
in
this
matrix
.

Polyamine
depletion
delays
apoptosis
of
rat
intestinal
epithelial
cells
.

The
polyamines
spermidine
,
spermine
,
and
their
precursor
putrescine
are
essential
for
cell
growth
and
the
regulation
of
the
cell
cycle
.

Recent
studies
suggest
that
excessive
accumulation
of
polyamines
favors
either
malignant
transformation
or
apoptosis
,
depending
on
the
cell
type
and
the
stimulus
.

This
study
examines
the
involvement
of
polyamines
in
the
induction
of
apoptosis
by
the
DNA
topoisomerase
I
inhibitor
,
camptothecin
.

In
IEC
-
6
cells
,
camptothecin
induced
apoptosis
within
6
h
,
accompanied
by
detachment
of
cells
.

Detached
cells
showed
DNA
laddering
and
caspase
3
induction
,
characteristic
features
of
apoptosis
.

Depletion
of
putrescine
,
spermidine
,
and
spermine
by
DL
-
alpha
-
difluoromethylornithine
(
DFMO
)
,
a
specific
inhibitor
of
ornithine
decarboxylase
(
ODC
)
that
is
the
first
rate
-
limiting
enzyme
for
polyamine
biosynthesis
,
decreased
the
apoptotic
index
.

Delayed
apoptosis
was
accompanied
by
a
decrease
in
caspase
3
activity
in
polyamine
-
depleted
cells
.

Addition
of
putrescine
restored
the
induction
of
apoptosis
as
indicated
by
an
increase
in
the
number
of
detached
cells
and
caspase
3
activity
.

Polyamine
depletion
did
not
change
the
level
of
caspase
3
protein
.

Inhibition
of
S
-
adenosylmethionine
decarboxylase
by
a
specific
inhibitor
[
diethylglyoxal
bis
-
(
guanylhydrazone
)
;
DEGBG
]
led
to
depletion
of
spermidine
and
spermine
with
a
significant
accumulation
of
putrescine
and
induction
of
ODC
.

The
DEGBG
-
treated
cells
showed
an
increase
in
apoptosis
,
suggesting
the
importance
of
putrescine
in
the
apoptotic
process
.

Addition
of
putrescine
to
DFMO
-
treated
cell
extracts
did
not
increase
caspase
3
activity
.

The
above
results
indicate
that
polyamine
depletion
delays
the
onset
of
apoptosis
in
IEC
-
6
cells
and
confers
protection
against
DNA
damaging
agents
,
suggesting
that
polyamines
might
be
involved
in
the
caspase
activating
signal
cascade
.

HT
:
the
mechanism
of

of
(

.

Some
clinical
evidence
has
suggested
that
(
+
/
-
)
pindolol
can
be
effective
at
producing
a
shortened
time
to
onset
of
antidepressant
activity
when
co
-
administered
with
a
serotonin
specific
reuptake
inhibitor
(
SSRI
)
.

This
effect
has
been
attributed
to
the
antagonist
effects
of
pindolol
at
the
5
-
HT
(
1A
)
receptor
.

In
the
present
study
,
we

with

,
using
in

in
the

of
the
freely

.

We
have
determined
that
the

can
be
augmented
by
(

,
suggesting
that
this
strategy
may
be
useful
in
further
augmenting
the

In

with
either

we
have
determined
that
(

pindolol
produces
much
of
its

Orlistat
,
a
new
lipase
inhibitor
for
the
management
of
obesity
.

Orlistat
,
a
weight
-
loss
agent
with
a
novel
mechanism
of
action
,
recently
was
approved
by
the
Food
and
Drug
Administration
for
the
treatment
of
obesity
.

It
inhibits
gastric
and
pancreatic
lipases
in
the
lumen
of
the
gastrointestinal
tract
to
decrease
systemic
absorption
of
dietary
fat
.

In
several
trials
lasting
up
to
2
years
,
orlistat
was
more
effective
than
diet
alone
for
weight
reduction
and
maintenance
of
lost
weight
.

Orlistat
treatment
also
results
in
modest
improvements
in
total
cholesterol
,
low
-
density
lipoprotein
,
blood
pressure
,
and
fasting
glucose
and
insulin
concentrations
.

The
major
adverse
effects
are
gastrointestinal
,
usually
occur
early
in
therapy
,
and
tend
to
decrease
with
continued
treatment
.

Because
orlistat
may
decrease
the
absorption
of
fat
-
soluble
vitamins
,
a
standard
multiple
-
vitamin
supplement
is
recommended
daily
during
therapy
to
prevent
abnormalities
in
vitamin
serum
concentrations
.

The
potential
for
severe
gastrointestinal
discomfort
and
the
modest
degree
of
weight
loss
may
limit
the
agent
'
s
clinical
utility
.

Its
long
-
term
safety
and
effectiveness
for
weight
maintenance
,
cost
-
effectiveness
of
treatment
,
and
overall
reduction
in
obesity
-
related
morbidity
and
mortality
remain
to
be
determined
.

Evaluation
of
flutamide
genotoxicity
in
rats
and
in
primary

hepatocytes
.

Flutamide
,
an
effective
competitive
inhibitor
of
the
androgen
receptor
used
orally
for
palliative
treatment
of
prostatic
carcinoma
and
regulation
of
prostatic
hyperplasia
was
evaluated
for
its
genotoxic
effects
in
the
intact
rat
and
in
primary
cultures
of
human
hepatocytes
.

Negative
responses
were
obtained
in
all
the
in
vivo
assays
as
well
as
in
the
in

assay
.

In
rats
given
a
single
oral
dose
of
500
mg
/
kg
flutamide
,
fragmentation
and
repair
of
liver
DNA
were
absent
,
and
no
increase
was
observed
in
the
frequency
of
micronucleated
hepatocytes
.

In
the
liver
of
rats
given
flutamide
as
initiating
agent
at
the
dose
of
500
mg
/
kg
/
week
for
6
successive
weeks
,
gamma
-
glutamyltraspeptidase
-
positive
foci
were
detected
only
in
3
of
10
rats
.

There
was
no
evidence
of
a
promoting
effect
on
the
development
of
aberrant
crypt
foci
in
rats
given
100
mg
/
kg
flutamide
on
alternate
days
for
8
successive
weeks
.

In
primary
cultures
of
human
hepatocytes
from
one
male
and
one
female
donor
DNA
fragmentation
as
measured
by
the
Comet
assays
,
and
DNA
repair
synthesis
as
revealed
by
quantitative
autoradiography
,
were
absent
after
a
20
hr
exposure
to
flutamide
concentrations
ranging
from
18
to
56
microM
.

Taken
as
a
whole
,
our
results
seem
to
indicate
that
flutamide
is
a
non
-
genotoxic
drug
.

.

SEARCH
STRATEGY
:
Randomised
,
controlled
trials
(
RCTs
)
were
identified
using
the
Cochrane
Airways
Group
register
.

The
register
was
searched
using
the
following
terms
:
asthma
and
theophylline
and
long
acting
beta
-
agonist
or
formoterol
or
foradile
or
eformoterol
or
salmeterol
or
bambuterol
or
bitolterol
.

Titles
and
abstracts
were
then
screened
to
identify
potentially
relevant
studies
.

The
bibliography
of
each
RCT
was
searched
for
additional
RCTs
.

Authors
of
identified
RCTs
were
contacted
for
other
relevant
published
and
unpublished
studies
.

SELECTION
CRITERIA
:
All
included
studies
were
RCTs
involving
adults
and
children
with
clinical
evidence
of
asthma
.

These
studies
must
have
compared
oral

DATA
COLLECTION
AND
ANALYSIS
:
Potentially
relevant
trials
,
identified
by
screening
titles
and
/
or
abstracts
,
were
obtained
.

Two
reviewers
independently
assessed
full
text
versions
of
these
trials
to
decided
whether
the
trial
should
be
included
in
the
review
,
and
assessed
its
methodological
quality
.

Where
there
was
disagreement
between
reviewers
,
this
was
resolved
by
consensus
,
or
reference
to
a
third
party
.

Data
were
extracted
by
two
independent
reviewers
.

Inter
-
rater
reliability
was
assessed
by
simple
agreement
.

Study
authors
were
contacted
to
clarify
randomisation
methods
,
provide
missing
data
,
verify
the
data
extracted
and
identify
unpublished
studies
.

Relevant
pharmaceutical
manufacturers
were
also
contacted
.

MAIN
RESULTS
:
Six
trials
met
the
inclusion
criteria
.

Five
used
salmeterol
and
one
,
biltoterol
.

They
were
of
varying
quality
.

There
was
a
trend
for
salmeterol
to
improve
FEV1
more
than
theophylline
in
three
studies
and
salmeterol
use
was
associated
with
more
symptom
free
nights
.

Bitolterol
,
used
in
only
one
study
,
was
reported
to
be
less
effective
than
theophylline
.

Subjects
taking
salmeterol
experienced
fewer
adverse
events
than
those
using
theophylline

CONCLUSIONS
:
Salmeterol
may
be
more
effective
than
theophylline
in
reducing
asthma
symptoms
including
night
waking
and
improving
lung

.

More
adverse

occurred
in
subjects
using
theophylline
when
compared
to
salmeterol
.

Neostigmine
:
safe
and
effective
treatment
for
acute
colonic
pseudo
-
obstruction
.

BACKGROUND
:
Ogilvie
'
s
syndrome
,
or
acute
colonic
pseudo
-
obstruction
,
is
a
common
and
relatively
dangerous
condition
.

If
left
untreated
,
it
may
cause
ischemic
necrosis
and
colonic
perforation
,
with
a
mortality
rate
as
high
as
50
percent
.

Neostigmine
enhances
excitatory
parasympathetic
activity
by
competing
with
acetylcholine
for
attachment
to
acetylcholinesterase
at
sites
of
cholinergic
transmission
and
enhancing
cholinergic
action
.

We
hypothesized
that
neostigmine
would
restore
peristalsis
in
patients
with
acute
colonic
pseudo
-
obstruction
.

METHODS
:
Twenty
-
eight
patients
at
Fletcher
Allen
Health
Care
and
The
Cleveland
Clinic
Foundation
were
treated
for
acute
colonic
pseudo
-
obstruction
with
neostigmine
2
.
5
mg
IV
over
3
minutes
while
being
monitored
with
telemetry
.

Mechanical
obstruction
had
been
excluded
.

RESULTS
:
Complete
clinical
resolution
of
large
bowel
distention
occurred
in
26
of
the
28
patients
.

Time
to
pass
flatus
varied
from
30
seconds
to
10
minutes
after
administration
of
neostigmine
.

No
adverse
effects
or
complications
were
noted
.

Of
the
two
patients
who
did
not
resolve
,
one
had
a
sigmoid
cancer
that
required
resection
and
one
patient
died
from
multiorgan
failure
.

CONCLUSION
:
This
study
supports
the
theory
that
acute
colonic
pseudo
-
obstruction
is
the
result
of
excessive
parasympathetic
suppression
rather
than
sympathetic
overactivity
.

We
have
shown
that
neostigmine
is
a
safe
and
effective
treatment
for
acute
colonic
pseudo
-
obstruction
.

Here
we
compared
the

of
N
(

H
(

)
biopterin
substituted
at
N
(
5
)
with
methyl
,
hydroxymethyl
,
formyl
and
acetyl
groups
were
used
.

Substitution
at
N
(
5
)
occurs
at
a
position
critical
to
the
redox
cycle
of
the
cofactor
in
phenylalanine
hydroxylase
/
dihydropteridine
reductase
.

We
also
included
N

)
biopterin
,
a
derivative
substituted
at
a
position
not
directly
involved
in
redox
cycling
,
as
a
control
.

As
compared
with
N
(

)
-
methyl

,
N
(

bound
with
twice
the
capacity
but
stimulated

synthase
to
a
lesser
extent
.

Depending
on
the
substituent
used
,
N
(
5
)
-
substituted
derivatives
were
redox

active
:
N
(

and
N
(

.

N
(

)
-
Substituted
H
(
4
)
biopterin
derivatives
were
not
oxidized
to
products
serving
as
substrates
for
dihydropteridine
reductase
and
,
depending
on
the
substituent
,
were
competitive
inhibitors
of
phenylalanine
hydroxylase
:
N
(
5
)
-
methyl
-
and
N
(
5
)
-
hydroxymethyl
H
(
4
)
biopterin
inhibited
phenylalanine
hydroxylase
,
whereas
N
(
5
)
-
formyl
-
and
N
(
5
)
-
acetyl
H
(
4
)
biopterin
had
no
effect
.

Our
data
demonstrate
differences
in
the
mechanism
of
stimulation
of
phenylalanine
hydroxylase
and
nitric
oxide
synthase
by
H
(
4
)
biopterin
.

They
are
compatible
with
a
novel
,
non

classical
,
redox

active
contribution
of
H
(

biopterin
to
the
catalysis
of

Dose

release
of
endogenous
tissue
factor
pathway
inhibitor
by
different
low
molecular

heparins
.

Tissue
factor
pathway
inhibitor
(
TFPI
)
is
released
to
circulating
blood
after
intravenous
and
subcutaneous
injections
of
heparins
,
and
may
thus
contribute
to
the
antithrombotic
effect
of
heparins
.

A
previous
study
suggested
different
abilities
of
various
low
molecular
weight
heparins
(
LMWH
)
to
release
endogenous
TFPI
,
but
the
dose

relationship
was
not
determined
.

In
the
present
study
,
the
dose

relationship
for
escalating
doses
of
two
LMWHs
,
dalteparin
and
enoxaparin
,
on
the
release
of
endogenous
TFPI
was
investigated
.

Six

.

The
study
was
a
randomized
,
cross
-
over

with
a
1
-

wash
-
out
period
between
each
injection
.

Peak

were
detected
after
only
1

,
whereas
anti

and
anti

(
anti

)
activities
were
detected
after
2

6
h
.

Putative
therapeutic
equivalent
doses
of
dalteparin
and
enoxaparin
gave
similar
release
of
endogenous

,
but
dissimilar

on

,
is
known
to
be

In
this

,
we
examined
whether
betaxolol

interact

None

,
even
at

showed
that
betaxolol
increased
the
K

but
had
no

The
association

of
[

-
BTX

were
unaffected
by
betaxolol
,
but
the
drug
significantly
accelerated
the

These
findings
argue
for
a

The

of
the

may
have

are
antimetabolites
which
are
metabolized
to
their

forms
which
inhibit
DNA

via
inhibition
of

.

To
investigate

,
we
established

against
these

escalation
of

,
and
analyzed
the

and
the
mechanism

to

.

When

with
the
3
drugs
for
72
h
,
the
resistance
ratio
to

was

However

also
showed
about

.

Analysis
of
enzyme
activities

indicated
that
a
significant
decrease
in
orotate

activity
in

,
a

Thd

were
the
major

These

were
closely

When

were
treated
with

,
the

1
cells
were
markedly
different
for
FdUrd

Thd
,
suggesting
that
the
cytotoxicity
with
short

exposure
to

is
due
to
a
mechanism
other
than

In
conclusion
,

only

Since

did

the

is
specific
for
factor

and
is
not
attributable
to
the
Gla

of
all

These
observations
indicate
that
under

increase
the

The

establish
that

Chromosomal
localization
,
gene
structure
,
and
expression
pattern
of
DDAH1
:
comparison
with
DDAH2
and
implications
for
evolutionary
origins
.

Endogenously
produced
asymmetrically
methylated
arginine
residues
are
competitive
inhibitors
of
all
three
isoforms
of
nitric
oxide
synthase
(
NOS
)
.

The
enzyme
dimethylarginine
dimethylaminohydrolase
(
DDAH
)
specifically
hydrolyzes
these
asymmetrically
methylated
arginine
residues
to
citrulline
and
methylamines
.

Previously
we
have
proposed
that
regulation
of
asymmetric
methylarginine
concentration
by
DDAH
may
provide
a
novel
mechanism
for
the
regulation
of
NOS
activity
in
vivo
.

Recently
we
reported
the
cloning
of
human
DDAH
and
identified
a
novel
human
DDAH
isoform
(
DDAH
I
and
DDAH
II
,
respectively
)
.

Here
we
report
that
the
DDAH1
gene
maps
to
chromosome
1p22
and
confirm
that
DDAH2
maps
to
the
MHC
III
region
of
chromosome
6p21
.
3
.

Extensive
analysis
of
the
distribution
of
DDAH1
and
DDAH2
mRNA
in
50
human
tissues
indicates
differential
expression
of
DDAH
isoforms
in
brain
regions
,
in
immune
cells
,
and
during
development
.

DDAH2
expression
predominates
in
highly
vascularized
tissues
that
express
the
endothelial
NOS
isoform
and
in
immune
tissues
that
can
express
iNOS
.

Whereas
DDAH2
is
expressed
at
relatively
high
levels
in
all
fetal
tissues
examined
,
DDAH1
expression
varies
little
between
fetal
and
adult
tissues
.

The
chromosomal
localization
of
the
DDAHs
is
consistent
with
gene
duplication
,
and
consistent
with
this
,
comparison
of
the
gene
structures
indicates
that
the
intron
/
exon
organization
is
highly
conserved
.

Phylogenetic
analysis
of
DDAH
sequences
from
diverse
species
suggests
that
DDAH
gene
duplication
occurred
prior
to
the
emergence
of
bony
fish
some
400
million
years
ago
.

Overall
the
data
suggest
that
DDAH2
may
be
the
more
ancient
of
the
two
genes
.

in

by

of
the

identified
in

and
various
regions
of
the
brain
in

-
treated
rats
.

The
concentration
of
CK
and
PHTZDC
in
whole
brain
and
various
regions
of
the
brain
increased
gradually
after
administration
of
D
,
L
-
propargylglycine
,
and
reached
the
highest
value
at
about
20
hours
.

CK
and
PHTZDC
accumulated
in

of
the
brain
in
proportion
to
the
amount
of
accumulated
cystathionine
after
D

The
concentration
of
these
compounds
in

was

Species
-
specific
pharmacological
properties
of
human
alpha
(
2A
)
-
adrenoceptors
.

On
the
basis
of
data
obtained
in
rabbits
,
the
imidazoline
receptor
ligand
rilmenidine
has
been
suggested
to
decrease
blood
pressure
in
humans
by
activating
central
alpha
(
2A
)
-
adrenoceptors
.

A
prerequisite
for
this
hypothesis
was
the
unproved
assumption
that
rabbit
and
human
alpha
(
2A
)
-
adrenoceptors
are
equally
activated
by
rilmenidine
.

Because
alpha
(
2A
)
-
adrenoceptors
in
the
brain
and
on
cardiovascular
sympathetic
nerve
terminals
are
identical
,
the
latter
were
used
as
a
model
for
the
former
to
confirm
or
disprove
this
assumption
.

Human
atrial
appendages
and
rabbit
pulmonary
arteries
were
used
to
determine
the
potencies
of
alpha
(
2
)
-
adrenoceptor
agonists
in
inhibiting
the
electrically
(
2
Hz
)
evoked
[
(
3
)
H
]
norepinephrine
release
and
of
antagonists
in
counteracting
the
alpha
(
2
)
-
adrenoceptor
-
mediated
inhibition
induced
by
moxonidine
.

In
the
rabbit
pulmonary
artery
,
rilmenidine
and
oxymetazoline
are
potent
full
agonists
,
whereas
in
the
human
atrial
appendages
they
are
antagonists
at
the
alpha
(
2
)
-
autoreceptors
,
sharing
this
property
with
rauwolscine
,
phentolamine
,
and
idazoxan
.

In
contrast
,
prazosin
is
ineffective
.

In
addition
,
a
partial
nucleotide
and
amino
acid
sequence
of
the
rabbit
alpha
(
2A
)
-
adrenoceptor
(
a
region
known
to
substantially
influence
the
pharmacological
characteristics
of
the
alpha
(
2
)
-
adrenoceptor
)
revealed
marked
differences
between
the
rabbit
and
the
human
alpha
(
2A
)
-
adrenoceptor
.

The
sympathetic
nerves
of
both
the
human
atrial
appendages
and
rabbit
pulmonary
artery
are
endowed
with
alpha
(
2A
)
-
autoreceptors
,
at
which
,
however
,
both
rilmenidine
and
oxymetazoline
exhibit
different
properties
(
antagonism
and
agonism
,
respectively
)
.

The
antagonistic
property
of
rilmenidine
at
human
alpha
(
2A
)
-
adrenoceptors
indicates
that
in
contrast
to
the
suggestion
based
on
rabbit
data
,
the
hypotensive
property
of
the
drug
in
humans
is
not
due
to
activation
of
alpha
(
2A
)
-
adrenoceptors
but
other
,
presumably
I
(
1
)
-
imidazoline
receptors
,
are
probably
involved
.

Mechanisms
of
agonist
-
induced
down
-
regulation
of
the
human
kappa
-
opioid
receptor
:
internalization
is
required
for
down
-
regulation
.

Previously
,
we
showed
that
the
human
kappa
-
opioid
receptor
(
hkor
)
stably
expressed
in
Chinese
hamster
ovary
(
CHO
)
cells
underwent
down
-
regulation
after
prolonged
U50
,
488H
treatment
.

In
the
present
study
,
we
determined
the
mechanisms
underlying
this
process
.

U50
,
488H
caused
a
significant
down
-
regulation
of
the
hkor
,
although
etorphine
did
not
.

Neither
U50
,
488H
nor
etorphine
caused
down
-
regulation
of
the
rat
kappa
-
opioid
receptor
.

Thus
,
similar
to
internalization
,
there
are
agonist
and
species
differences
in
down
-
regulation
of
kappa
-
opioid
receptors
.

.

Coexpression
of
GRK2
or
GRK2
and
arrestin

permitted
etorphine
to
induce
down

regulation
of
the
hkor
,
although

did
not
.

or
proteasome

(

,
or
lactacystin
)
decreased
the
extent
of
U50
,
488H

.

A
combination
of
chloroquine
and
proteasome
inhibitor
I
abolished
U50
,
488H
-
induced
down
-
regulation
.

These
results
indicate
that
U50
,
488H
-
induced
down
-
regulation
of
the
hkor
involves
GRK
-
,
arrestin
-
2
-
,
dynamin
-
,
rab5
-
,
and
rab7
-
dependent
mechanisms
and
receptors
seem
to
be
trafficked
to
lysosomes
and
proteasomes
for
degradation
.

Thus
,
U50
,
488H
-
induced
internalization
and
down
-
regulation
of
the
hkor
share
initial
common
mechanisms
.

To
the
best
of
our
knowledge
,
these
results
represent
the
first
report
on
the
involvement
of
both
rab5
and
rab7
in
agonist
-
induced
down
-
regulation
of
a
G
protein
-
coupled
receptor
.

In
addition
,
this
study
is
among
the
first
to
show
the
involvement
of
proteasomes
in
agonist
-
induced
down
-
regulation
of
a
G
protein
-
coupled
receptor
.

Oral
administration
of
tetrahydrobiopterin
prevents
endothelial
dysfunction
and
vascular
oxidative
stress
in
the
aortas
of
insulin
-
resistant
rats
.

We
have
reported
that
a
deficiency
of
tetrahydrobiopterin
(
BH
(
4
)
)
,
an
active
cofactor
of
endothelial
NO
synthase
(
eNOS
)
,
contributes
to
the
endothelial
dysfunction
through
reduced
eNOS
activity
and
increased
superoxide
anion
(
O
(
2
)
(
-
)
)
generation
in
the
insulin
-
resistant
state
.

To
further
confirm
this
hypothesis
,
we
investigated
the
effects
of
dietary
treatment
with
BH
(
4
)
on
endothelium
-
dependent
arterial
relaxation
and
vascular
oxidative
stress
in
the
aortas
of
insulin
-
resistant
rats
.

Oral
supplementation
of
BH
(
4
)
(
10
mg
.
kg
(
-
1
)
.
d
(
-
1
)
)
for
8
weeks
significantly
increased
the
BH
(
4
)
content
in
cardiovascular
tissues
of
rats
fed
high
levels
of
fructose
(
fructose
-
fed
rats
)
.

Impairment
of
endothelium
-
dependent
arterial
relaxation
in
the
aortic
strips
of
the
fructose
-
fed
rats
was
reversed
with
BH
(
4
)
treatment
.

The
BH
(
4
)
treatment
was
associated
with
a
2
-
fold
increase
in
eNOS
activity
as
well
as
a
70
%
reduction
in
endothelial
O
(
2
)
(
-
)
production
compared
with
those
in
fructose
-
fed
rats
.

The
BH
(
4
)
treatment
also
partially
improved
the
insulin
sensitivity
and
blood
pressure
,
as
well
as
the
serum
triglyceride
concentration
,
in
the
fructose
-
fed
rats
.

Moreover
,
BH
(
4
)
treatment
of
the
fructose
-
fed
rats
markedly
reduced
the
lipid
peroxide
content
of
both
aortic
and
cardiac
tissues
and
inhibited
the
activation
of
2
redox
-
sensitive
transcription
factors
,
nuclear
factor
-
kappaB
and
activating
protein
-
1
,
which
were
increased
in
fructose
-
fed
rats
.

The
BH
(
4
)
treatment
of
control
rats
did
not
have
any
significant
effects
on
these
parameters
.

These
results
indicate
that
BH
(
4
)
augmentation
is
essential
for
the
restoration
of
eNOS
function
and
the
reduction
of
vascular
oxidative
stress
in
insulin
-
resistant
rats
.

Fumarate
reductase
is
essential
for
Helicobacter
pylori
colonization
of
the
mouse
stomach
.

Fumarate
reductase
(
FRD
)
is
the
key
enzyme
in
fumarate
respiration
induced
by
anaerobic
growth
of
bacteria
.

In
Helicobacter
pylori
,
this
enzyme
appears
to
be
constitutively
expressed
under
microaerobic
conditions
and
is
not
essential
for
its
survival
in
vitro
.

In
this
study
,
the
role
of
FRD
in
the
colonization
of
H
.
pylori
was
investigated
using
a
mouse
model
.

The
frdA
gene
coding
for
subunit
A
of
FRD
,
and
two
control
genes
,
copA
and
copP
associated
with
the
export
of
copper
out
of
H
.
pylori
,
were
inactivated
by
insertion
of
the
chloramphenicol
acetyltransferase
cassette
into
these
individual
genes
.

The
isogenic
mutants
of
H

pylori
strain
AH244
were
obtained
by
natural
transformation
.

Seventy

five
ICR

(
15

)
were
orogastrically
dosed
with
either
the
wild

H
.
pylori
strain
AH244
,
its
isogenic
mutants
,
or
Brucella
broth
(
negative
control
)
.

Five
mice
from
each
group
were
killed
at
2
,
4
and
8
weeks
post

inoculation
(
WPI
)
,
respectively
.

H
.
pylori
colonization
was
not
detected
in
mouse
gastric
mucosa
infected
with
the
frdA
mutant
at
any
time
point
in
the
study
by
both
quantitative

and
PCR
.

In
contrast
,
the
mice
inoculated
with
either
wild
type
AH244
,
copA
or
copPH
.
pylori
mutants
became
readily

.

These
data
indicate
that
FRD
plays
a
crucial
role
in
H
.
pylori
survival
in
the
gastric
mucosa
of
mice
.

Given
that
FRD

as
in

similarity
,
including
six
identical
residues
PEVKEK
,
to
the
P2C
protein
of
coxsackie
B
virus
,
suggesting
that
cross
-
reactivity
between
coxsackie
B
virus
and
GAD65
can
initiate
autoimmune
diabetes
.

We
used
the
human
islet
cell
mAbs
MICA3
and
MICA4
to
identify
the
Ab
epitopes
of
GAD65
by
screening
phage
-
displayed
random
peptide
libraries
.

The
identified
peptide
sequences
could
be
mapped
to
a
homology
model
of
the
pyridoxal
phosphate
(
PLP
)
binding
domain
of
GAD65
.

For
MICA3
,
a
surface
loop
containing
the
sequence
PEVKEK
and
two
adjacent
exposed
helixes
were
identified
in
the
PLP
binding
domain
as
well
as
a
region
of
the
C
terminus
of
GAD65
that
has
previously
been
identified
as
critical
for
MICA3
binding
.

To
confirm
that
the
loop
containing
the
PEVKEK
sequence
contributes
to
the
MICA3
epitope
,
this
loop
was
deleted
by
mutagenesis
.

This
reduced
binding
of
MICA3
by
70
%
.

Peptide
sequences
selected
using
MICA4
were
rich
in
basic
or
hydroxyl
-
containing
amino
acids
,
and
the
surface
of
the
GAD65
PLP
-
binding
domain
surrounding
Lys358
,
which
is
known
to
be
critical
for
MICA4
binding
,
was
likewise
rich
in
these
amino
acids
.

Also
,
the
two
phage
most
reactive
with
MICA4
encoded
the
motif
VALxG
,
and
the
reverse
of
this
sequence
,
LAV
,
was
located
in
this
same
region
.

Thus
,
we
have
defined
the
MICA3
and
MICA4
epitopes
on
GAD65
using
the
combination
of
phage
display
,
molecular
modeling
,
and
mutagenesis
and
have
provided
compelling
evidence
for
the
involvement
of
the
PEVKEK
loop
in
the
MICA3
epitope
.

Effects
of
a
serotonin
5
-
HT
(
4
)
receptor
antagonist
SB
-
207266
on
gastrointestinal
motor
and
sensory
function
in
humans
.

BACKGROUND
:
Serotonin
5
-
HT
(
4
)
receptors
are
located
on
enteric
cholinergic
neurones
and
may
regulate
peristalsis
.

5
-
HT
(
4
)
receptors
on
primary
afferent
neurones
have
been
postulated
to
modulate
visceral
sensation
.

While
5
-
HT
(
4
)
agonists
are
used
as
prokinetic
agents
,
the
physiological
role
of
5
-
HT
(
4
)
receptors
in
the
human
gut
is
unknown
.

AIMS
:
Our
aim
was
to
characterise
the
role
of
5
-
HT
(
4
)
receptors
in
regulating
gastrointestinal
motor
and
sensory
function
in
healthy
subjects
under
baseline
and
stimulated
conditions
with
a
5
-
HT
(
4
)
receptor
antagonist
.

METHODS
:
Part
A
compared
the
effects
of
placebo
to
four
doses
of
a
5
-
HT
(
4
)
receptor
antagonist
(
SB
-
207266
)
on
the
cisapride
mediated
increase
in
plasma
aldosterone
(
a
5
-
HT
(
4
)
mediated
response
)
and
orocaecal
transit
in
18
subjects
.

In
part
B
,
52
healthy
subjects
received
placebo
,
or
0

05
,
0
.
5
,
or
5
mg
of
SB
-
207266
for
10
-
12
days
;
gastric
,
small
bowel
,
and
colonic
transit
were
measured
by
scintigraphy
on
days
7
-
9
,
and
fasting
and
postprandial
colonic
motor
function
,
compliance
,
and
sensation
during
distensions
were
assessed
on
day
12
.

RESULTS
:
Part
A
:
0
.
5
,
5
,
and
20
mg
doses
of
SB
-
207266
had
significant
and
quantitatively
similar
effects
,
antagonising
the
cisapride
mediated
increase
in
plasma
aldosterone
and
acceleration
of
orocaecal
transit
.

Part
B
:
SB
-
207266
tended
to
delay
colonic
transit
(
geometric
centre
of
isotope
at
24
(
p
=
0
.
06
)
and
48
hours
(
p
=
0
.
08
)
)
,
but
did
not
have
dose
related
effects
on
transit
,
fasting
or
postprandial
colonic
motor
activity
,
compliance
,
or
sensation
.

CONCLUSION
:
5
-
HT
(
4
)
receptors
are
involved
in
the
regulation
of
cisapride
stimulated
orocaecal
transit
;
SB
207266
tends
to
modulate
colonic
transit
but
not
sensory
functions
or
compliance
in
healthy
human
subjects
.

Amphetamine
-
type
central
nervous
system
stimulants
release
norepinephrine
more
potently
than
they
release
dopamine
and
serotonin
.

A
large
body
of
evidence
supports
the
hypothesis
that
mesolimbic
dopamine
(
DA
)
mediates
,
in
animal
models
,
the
reinforcing
effects
of
central
nervous
system
stimulants
such
as
cocaine
and
amphetamine
.

The
role
DA
plays
in
mediating
amphetamine
-
type
subjective
effects
of
stimulants
in
humans
remains
to
be
established
.

Both
amphetamine
and
cocaine
increase
norepinephrine
(
NE
)
via
stimulation
of
release
and
inhibition
of
reuptake
,
respectively
.

If
increases
in
NE
mediate
amphetamine
-
type
subjective
effects
of
stimulants
in
humans
,
then
one
would
predict
that
stimulant
medications
that
produce
amphetamine
-
type
subjective
effects
in
humans
should
share
the
ability
to
increase
NE
.

To
test
this
hypothesis
,
we
determined
,
using
in
vitro
methods
,
the
neurochemical
mechanism
of
action
of
amphetamine
,
3
,
4
-
methylenedioxymethamphetamine
(
MDMA
)
,
(
+
)
-
methamphetamine
,
ephedrine
,
phentermine
,
and
aminorex
.

As
expected
,
their
rank
order
of
potency
for
DA
release
was
similar
to
their
rank
order
of
potency
in
published
self
-
administration
studies
.

Interestingly
,
the
results
demonstrated
that
the
most
potent
effect
of
these
stimulants
is
to
release
NE
.

Importantly
,
the
oral
dose
of
these
stimulants
,
which
produce
amphetamine
-
type
subjective
effects
in
humans
,
correlated
with
the
their
potency
in
releasing
NE
,
not
DA
,
and
did
not
decrease
plasma
prolactin
,
an
effect
mediated
by
DA
release
.

These
results
suggest
that
NE
may
contribute
to
the
amphetamine
-
type
subjective
effects
of
stimulants
in
humans
.

potential

Insulin
-
like
growth
factor
(
IGF
)
-
binding
protein
(
IGFBP
)
-
related
proteins
(
IGFBP
-
rPs
)
are
newly
described
cysteine
-
rich
proteins
that
share
significant
aminoterminal
structural
similarity
with
the
conventional
IGFBPs
and
are
involved
in
a
diversity
of
biological
functions
,
including
growth
regulation
.

IGFBP
-
rP1
(
MAC25
/
Angiomodulin
/
prostacyclin
-
stimulating
factor
)
is
a
potential
tumor
-
suppressor
gene
that
is
differentially
expressed
in
meningiomas
,
mammary
and
prostatic
cancers
,
compared
with
their
malignant
counterparts
.

We
have
previously
shown
that
IGFBP
-
rP1
is
preferentially
produced
by
primary
cultures
of
human
prostate
epithelial
cells
(
HPECs
)
and
by
poorly
tumorigenic
P69SV40T
cells
,
compared
with
the
cancerous
prostatic
LNCaP
,
DU145
,
PC
-
3
,
and
M12
cells
.

We
now
show
that
IGFBP
-
rP1
increases
during
senescence
of
HPEC
.

IGFBP
-
rP2
(
also
known
as
connective
tissue
growth
factor
)
,
a
downstream
effector
of
transforming
growth
factor
(
TGF
)
-
beta
and
modulator
of
growth
for
both
fibroblasts
and
endothelial
cells
,
was
detected
in
most
of
the
normal
and
malignant
prostatic
epithelial
cells
tested
,
with
a
marked
up
-
regulation
of
IGFBP
-
rP2
during
senescence
of
HPEC
.

Moreover
,
IGFBP
-
rP2
noticeably
increased
in
response
to
TGF
-
beta1
and
all
-
trans
retinoic
acid
(
atRA
)
in
HPEC
and
PC
-
3
cells
,
and
it
decreased
in
response
to
IGF
-
I
in
HPEC
.

IGFBP
-
rP3
[
nephroblastoma
overexpressed
(
NOV
)
]
,
the
protein
product
of
the
NOV
protooncogene
,
was
not
detected
in
HPEC
but
was
expressed
in
the
tumorigenic
DU145
and
PC
-
3
cells
.

It
was
also
synthesized
by
the
SV40
-
T
antigen
-
transformed
P69
and
malignant
M12
cells
,
where
it
was
down
-
regulated
by
atRA
.

These
observations
suggest
biological
roles
of
IGFBP
-
rPs
in
the
human
prostate
.

IGFBP
-
rP1
and
IGFBP
-
rP2
are
likely
to
negatively
regulate
growth
,
because
they
seem
to
increase
during
senescence
of
the
prostate
epithelium
and
in
response
to
growth
inhibitors
(
TGF
-
beta1
and
atRA
)
.

Although
the
data
collected
on
IGFBP
-
rP3
in
prostate
are
modest
,
its
role
as
a
growth
stimulator
and
/
or
protooncogene
is
supported
by
its
preferential
expression
in
cancerous
cells
and
its
down
-
regulation
by
atRA
.

Neuropsychological

:
assessment
of
the
contribution
of
neuroleptic

.

Patients
with
schizophrenia
show
impairments
of
attention
and
neuropsychological
performance
,
but
the
extent
to
which
this
is
attributable
to
antipsychotic
medication
remains
largely
unexplored
.

We
describe
here
the
putative
influence
of
the
dose
of
antipsychotic
medication
(
chlorpromazine
equivalents
,
CPZ
)
,
the
antipsychotic
serum
concentration
of
dopamine
(
DA
)

and
the
approximated

)
,
on
conditioned

)
measures
of
attention
and
performance
on
a
neuropsychological
battery
,
in
108
patients
with
schizophrenia
(
compared
with
62
healthy
controls
)
.

Antipsychotic
serum
concentration
and
D2
-
occupancy
were
higher
in
patients
with
a
paranoid
versus
non
-
paranoid
diagnosis
,
and
in
female
versus
male
patients
(
independent
of
symptom
severity
)
.

Controlling
for
D2
-
occupancy
removed
the
difference
between
high
CB
in
paranoid
and
impaired
low
CB
in
non
-
paranoid
patients
.

Similar
partial
correlations
for
antipsychotic
drug
dose
and
serum
levels
of
DA
D2
-
blocking
activity
with
performance
of
the
trail
-

tests
(
negative
)
and
the
block

design
task
(
positive
)
showed
the
functional
importance
of
DA
-
related
activity
.

High
estimates
of
central
DA
D2
-
occupancy
were
related
to
impaired
verbal
fluency
but
were
associated
with
improved
recall
of
stories
,
especially
in
paranoid
patients
.

This
,
the
first
study
of
its
kind
,
tentatively
imputes
a
role
for
DA
D2

in

.

.

Peptidergic
neurones
accumulate
amines
via
an
unusual
uptake
process
,
designated
Transport

P
.

[

H

-
prazosin
binds
to
alpha
(

)
adrenoceptors
on
these
cells
and
is
displaceable
by
unlabelled
prazosin
in
concentrations
up
to
10
(
-

)
M
.

However
,
at
greater
concentrations
of
prazosin
,
there
is
a
paradoxical
accumulation
of
[
(
3
)
H
]
-
prazosin
which
we
have
attributed
to
Transport
-
P
.

Uptake
of
prazosin
via
Transport

P
is
detectable
at

(

M
prazosin
concentration
,
is
linear
up
to

M
and
at
greater
concentrations
becomes
non

linear
.

In
contrast
,
in
noradrenergic
neurones
,
noradrenaline
uptake
is
linear
and
saturates
above
10
(
-
7
)
M
.

In
noradrenergic
neurones
and
in
non

neuronal
cells
,
there
is
no
uptake
of
prazosin
in
concentrations
up
to
10
(
-
6
)
M
,
suggesting
that
Transport
-
P
is
a
specialised
function
of
peptidergic
neurones
.

peptidergic
(

,
we
have
studied
the
interaction
of
alpha
(
1
)
adrenoceptors
with
Transport
-
P
.

Polymerase
chain
reactions
and
DNA
sequencing
of

products
demonstrated
that
only
the

is
present
in

with

in

In

-
prazosin
was
displaced
likewise
by

adrenergic
agonists
,
none
of
which
increased
the
binding
of
[
(

H
]
-
prazosin
.

Hence
,
the
prazosin
paradox
is
not
due
to
some
function
of
alpha
(
1

adrenoceptors
,
such
as
internalization
of

In

resulted
in

the

Thus

alpha

These

that

Glioma

to
topotecan
:
the
role
of
p53
and
topotecan

induced
DNA
damage
.

Topotecan
is
a
topoisomerase
I
inhibitor
which
is
currently
evaluated
as
an
adjuvant
agent
for
malignant
glioma
.

Here
,
we
analysed
the
effects
of
topotecan
on
12
human
malignant
glioma
cell
lines
in
vitro
.

All
cell
lines
expressed
topoisomerase
I
mRNA
.

High
p53
protein
levels
,
but
not
genetic
or
functional
p53
status
,
were
associated
with
increased
topotecan
-
induced
DNA
/
topoisomerase
I
complex
formation
.

Neither
functional
p53
status
,
nor
p53
protein
levels
,
nor
complex
formation
predicted
topotecan
-
induced
growth
inhibition
.

We
thus
confirm
a
possible
role
for
p53
protein
in
modulating
topoisomerase
I
activity
but
conclude
that
the
major
molecular
determinants
of
topotecan
sensitivity
in
glioma
cells
await
identification
.

Clinical
effects
of
pranlukast
,
an
oral
leukotriene
receptor
antagonist
,
in
mild
-
to
-
moderate
asthma
:
a
4
week
randomized
multicentre
controlled
trial
.

OBJECTIVE
:
Leukotriene
antagonists
are
increasingly
used
in
asthma
management
.

Pranlukast
is
a
new
,
orally
active
,
selective
inhibitor
of
CysLt1
leukotriene
receptor
.

The
present
clinical
trial
was
performed
to
study
the
effect
and
safety
of
pranlukast
in
mild
-
to
-
moderate
asthma
.

METHODOLOGY
:
A
randomized
,
double
-
blind
,
placebo
-
controlled
,
parallel
group
study
was
performed
in
eight
medical
centres
in
Korea
.

Mild
-
to
-
moderate
asthma
patients
who
had
been
treated
with
beta2
-
agonists
and
/
or
inhaled
corticosteroids
were
studied
.

The
patients
'
symptoms
were
evaluated
by
asthma
diary
and
twice
-
daily
peak
flow
monitoring
.

RESULTS
:
Of
the
206
patients
enrolled
,
197
were
eligible
for
analysis
.

The
pranlukast
group
(
n
=
98
)
showed
statistically
significant
improvement
in
asthma
symptoms
,
including
asthma
attack
rate
,
daily
living
score
,
and
morning
and
evening
asthma
scores
.

Pranlukast
significantly
reduced
the
consumption
of
beta2
-
agonist
.

Compared
with
the
placebo
group
,
forced
vital
capacity
(
FVC
)
and
forced
expiratory
volume
in
1
s
(

were
not
significantly
higher
in
the
pranlukast
group
.

Morning
and
evening
peak
expiratory

)
were
significantly
increased
after
pranlukast
treatment
at
weeks

and

CONCLUSION
:
Pranlukast

Atp

bound
topoisomerase
ii
as
a
target
for
antitumor
drugs
.

Topoisomerase
II
(
TOP2
)
poisons
interfere
with
the
breakage
/
reunion
reaction
of
TOP2
resulting
in
DNA
cleavage
.

In
the
current
studies
,
we
show
that
two
different
classes
(
ATP
-
sensitive
and
-
insensitive
)
of
TOP2
poisons
can
be
identified
based
on
their
differential
sensitivity
to
the
ATP
-
bound
conformation
of
TOP2
.

First
,
in
the
presence
of
1
mm
ATP
or
the
nonhydrolyzable
analog
adenosine
5
'
-
(
beta
,
gamma
-

)
triphosphate
,
TOP2

induced
by
ATP
-
sensitive
TOP2
poisons
(

g
.
doxorubicin
,
etoposide
,
mitoxantrone
,
and
4
'
-
(
9
-
acridinylamino
)
methanesulfon
-
m
-
anisidide
)
was
30
-
100
-
fold
stimulated
,
whereas
DNA
cleavage
induced
by
ATP
-
insensitive
TOP2
poisons
(
e
.
g
.
amonafide
,
batracylin
,
and
menadione
)
was
only
slightly
(
less
than
3
-
fold
)
affected
.

In
addition
,
ADP
was
shown
to
strongly
antagonize
TOP2
-
mediated
DNA
cleavage
induced
by
ATP
-
sensitive
but
not
ATP
-
insensitive
TOP2
poisons
.

Second
,
C427A
mutant
human
TOP2alpha
,
which
exhibits
reduced
ATPase
activity
,
was
shown
to
exhibit
cross
-
resistance
to
all
ATP
-
sensitive
but
not
ATP
-
insensitive
TOP2
poisons
.

Third
,
using
ciprofloxacin
competition
assay
,
TOP2
-
mediated
DNA
cleavage
induced
by
ATP
-
sensitive
but
not
ATP
-
insensitive
poisons
was
shown
to
be
antagonized
by
ciprofloxacin
.

These
results
suggest
that
ATP
-
bound
TOP2
may
be
the
specific
target
of
ATP
-
sensitive
TOP2
poisons
.

Using
Lac
repressor
-
operator
complexes
as
roadblocks
,
we
show
that
ATP
-
bound
TOP2
acts
as
a
circular
clamp
capable
of
entering
DNA
ends
and
sliding
on
unobstructed
duplex
DNA
.

Antithrombin
binding
of
low
molecular
weight
heparins
and
inhibition
of
factor
Xa
.

Fluorescence
and
stopped
flow
methods
were
used
to
compare
clinically
used
heparins
with
regard
to
their
ability
to
bind
to
antithrombin
and
to
accelerate
the
inactivation
of
factor
Xa
.

Titration
of
antithrombin
with
both
low
molecular
weight
heparin
(
LMWH
)
(
enoxaparin
,
fragmin
and
ardeparin
)
and
unfractionated
heparin
(
UFH
)
produced
an
equivalent
fluorescence
increase
and
indicates
similar
affinity
of
all
heparin
preparations
to
antithrombin
.

However
,
relative
to
UFH
enoxaparin
,
the
LMWH
with
the
smallest
average
molecular
mass
,
contained
only
12
%
material
with
high
affinity
for
antithrombin
.

The
rate
of
factor
Xa
inhibition
by
antithrombin
increased
with
the
concentration
of
the
examined
heparins
to
the
same
limiting
value
,
but
the
concentration
required
for
maximal
acceleration
depended
on
the
preparation
.

According
to
these
data
the
high
affinity
fraction
of
the
heparin
preparations
increased
the
intrinsic
fluorescence
and
inhibitory
activity
equally
without
additional
effects
by
variations
in
chain
length
and
chemical
composition
.

In
contrast
,
in
the
presence
of
Ca
UFH
accelerated
the
inhibition
of
factor
Xa
by
antithrombin
10
-
fold
more
efficiently
than
comparable
concentrations
of
the
high
affinity
fractions
of
enoxaparin
and
fragmin
.

The
bell
-
shaped
dependence
of
this
accelerating
effect
suggests
simultaneous
binding
of
both
proteins
to
heparin
.

In
conclusion
,
under
physiologic
conditions
the
anti
-
factor
Xa
activity
of
heparin
results
from
a
composite
effect
of
chain
length
and
the
content
of
material
with
high
affinity
to
antithrombin
.

Thus
,
the
reduced
antithrombotic
activity
of
LMWH
relative
to
UFH
results
from
a
smaller
content
of
high
affinity
material
and
the
absence
of
a
stimulating
effect
of
calcium
.

Mutations
in
the
follicle
-
stimulating
hormone
-
beta
(
FSH
beta
)
and
FSH
receptor
genes
in
mice
and
humans
.

Follicle
-
stimulating
hormone
(
FSH
)
,
a
dimeric
glycoprotein
synthesized
in
the
anterior
pituitary
gland
,
is
important
for
the
production
of
sex
steroids
and
gametes
.

FSH
-
beta
(
FSH
beta
)
and
FSH
receptor
(
FSHR
)
knockout
mice
display
impaired
ovarian
follicular
development
and
infertility
in
females
and
small
testes
,
oligospermia
,
and
fertility
in
males
.

Humans
with
FSH
beta
gene
mutations
tend
to
have
a
more
severe
phenotype
than
those
with
FSHR
gene
mutations
,
although
infertility
and
varying
degrees
of
impaired
sex
steroid
production
occur
in
both
types
of
mutations
.

Data
from
human
and
mouse
mutations
in
the
FSH
beta
and
FSHR
genes
suggest
that
FSH
is
necessary
for
normal
pubertal
development
and
fertility
in
males
and
females
.

Acyl
-
CoA
synthetase
isoforms
1
,
4
,
and
5
are
present
in
different
subcellular
membranes
in
rat
liver
and
can
be
inhibited
independently
.

Inhibition
studies
have
suggested
that
acyl
-
CoA
synthetase
(
ACS
,
EC
)
isoforms
might
regulate
the
use
of
acyl
-
CoAs
by
different
metabolic
pathways
.

In
order
to
determine
whether
the
subcellular
locations
differed
for
each
of
the
three
ACSs
present
in
liver
and
whether
these
isoforms
were
regulated
independently
,
non
-
cross
-
reacting
peptide
antibodies
were
raised
against
ACS1
,
ACS4
,
and
ACS5
.

ACS1
was
identified
in
endoplasmic
reticulum
,
mitochondria
-
associated
membrane
(
MAM
)
,
and
cytosol
,
but
not
in
mitochondria
.

ACS4
was
present
primarily
in
MAM
,
and
the
76
-
kDa
ACS5
protein
was
located
in
mitochondrial
membrane
.

Consistent
with
these
locations
,
N
-
ethylmaleimide
,
an
inhibitor
of
ACS4
,
inhibited
ACS
activity
47
%
in
MAM
and
28
%
in
endoplasmic
reticulum
.

Troglitazone
,
a
second
ACS4
inhibitor
,
inhibited
ACS
activity
<
10
%
in
microsomes
and
mitochondria
and
45
%
in
MAM
.

Triacsin
C
,
a
competitive
inhibitor
of
both
ACS1
and
ACS4
,
inhibited
ACS
activity
similarly
in
endoplasmic
reticulum
,
MAM
,
and
mitochondria
,
suggesting
that
a
hitherto
unidentified
triacsin
-
sensitive
ACS
is
present
in
mitochondria
.

ACS1
,
ACS4
,
and
ACS5
were
regulated
independently
by
fasting
and
re
-
feeding
.

Fasting
rats
for
48
h
resulted
in
a
decrease
in
ACS4
protein
,
and
an
increase
in
ACS5
.

Re
-
feeding
normal
chow
or
a
high
sucrose
diet
for
24
h
after
a
48
-
h
fast
increased
both
ACS1
and
ACS4
protein
expression
1
.
5
-
2
.
0
-
fold
,
consistent
with
inhibition
studies
.

These
results
suggest
that
ACS1
and
ACS4
may
be
linked
to
triacylglycerol
synthesis
.

Taken
together
,
the
data
suggest
that
acyl
-
CoAs
may
be
functionally
channeled
to
specific
metabolic
pathways
through
different
ACS
isoforms
in
unique
subcellular
locations
.

Differential

[
3H
]
-
quinuclinidyl
benzilate
binding
to
muscarinic
receptors
in
rat
brain
membranes
with
acetylcholinesterase
inhibitors
.

The
potential
interaction
of
acetylcholinesterase
inhibitors
with
cholinergic
receptors
may
play
a
significant
role
in
the
therapeutic
and
/
or
side
-
effects
associated
with
this
class
of
compound
.

In
the
present
study
,
the
capacity
of
acetylcholinesterase
inhibitors
to
interact
with
muscarinic
receptors
was
assessed
by
their
ability
to
displace
both
[
3H
]
-
oxotremorine
-
M
and
[
3H
]
-
quinuclinidyl
benzilate
binding
in
rat
brain

.

The
[
3H
]
-
quinuclinidyl
benzilate
/
[
3H
]
-
oxotremorine
-
M
affinity
ratios
permitted
predictions
to
be
made
of
either
the
antagonist
or
agonist
properties
of
the
different
compounds
.

A
series
of
compounds
,
representative
of
the
principal
classes
of
acetylcholinesterase
inhibitors
,
displaced
[

]
-
oxotremorine

M
binding
with
high

to

moderate
potency
(

neostigmine
=
pyridostigmine
=
tacrine
>
physostigmine
>
edrophonium
=
galanthamine
>
desoxypeganine
)
whereas
only
ambenonium
and
tacrine
displaced
[
3H
]
-
quinuclinidyl
benzilate
binding
.

Inhibitors
such
as
desoxypeganine
,
parathion
and
gramine
demonstrated
negligible
inhibition
of
the
binding
of
both
radioligands
.

Scatchard

constructed
from
the
inhibition

the
absence
and
presence
of
different
inhibitors
showed
an
unaltered
Bmax
and
a
reduced
affinity
constant
,
indicative
of
potential
competitive
or
allosteric
mechanisms
.

The
capacity
of
acetylcholinesterase
inhibitors
,
with
the
exception
of
tacrine
and
ambenonium
,
to
displace
bound
[
3H
]
-
oxotremorine
-
M
in
preference
to
[
3H
]
quinuclinidyl
benzilate
predicts
that
the
former
compounds
could
act
as
potential
agonists
at
muscarinic
receptors
.

Moreover
,
the
rank
order
for
potency
in
inhibiting
acetylcholinesterase
(
ambenonium
>
neostigmine
=
physostigmine
=
tacrine
>
pyridostigmine
=
edrophonium
=
galanthamine
>
desoxypeganine
>
parathion
>
gramine
)
indicated
that
the
most
effective
inhibitors
of
acetylcholinesterase
also
displaced
[
3H
]
-
oxotremorine
-
M
to
the
greatest
extent
.

The
capacity
of
these
inhibitors
to
displace
[
3H
]
-
oxotremorine
-
M
binding
preclude
their
utilisation
for
the
prevention
of
acetylcholine
catabolism
in
rat
brain
membranes
,
the
latter
being
required
to
estimate
the
binding
of
acetylcholine
to

However
,
fasciculin
-

,
a
potent
peptide
inhibitor
of
acetylcholinesterase
(
IC50

nM
)
,
did
prevent
catabolism
of
acetylcholine
in
rat
brain
membranes
with
an
atypical
inhibition
isotherm
of
[
3H
]
-
oxotremorine
-

,
thus
permitting
an
estimation
of

for

Functional
consequences
of

KvLQT1
K

mutant
probed

transfer
in
cardiomyocytes
.

IKs
,
the
slow
component
of
the
delayed
rectifier
potassium
current
,
figures
prominently
in
the
repolarization
of
heart
cells
.

The
K
+
channel
gene
KvLQT1
is
mutated
in
the
heritable
long
QT
(
LQT
)
syndrome
.

Heterologous
coexpression
of
KvLQT1
and
the
accessory
protein
minK
yields
an
IKs
-
like
current
.

Nevertheless
,
the
links
between
KvLQT1
and
cardiac
IKs
are
largely
inferential
.

Since
the
LQT
syndrome
mutant
KvLQT1
-
G306R
suppresses
channel
activity
when
coexpressed
with
wild
-
type
KvLQT1
in
a
heterologous
system
,
overexpression
of
this
mutant
in
cardiomyocytes
should
reduce
or
eliminate
native
IKs
if
KvLQT1
is
indeed
the
major
molecular
component
of
this
current
.

To
test
this
idea
,
we
created
the
adenovirus
AdRMGI
-
KvLQT1
-
G306R
,
which
overexpresses
KvLQT1

G306R
channels
.

Indomethacin
activates
carbonic
anhydrase
and
antagonizes
the
effect
of
the
specific
carbonic
anhydrase
inhibitor
acetazolamide
,
by
a
direct
mechanism
of
action
.

OBJECTIVES
:
In
this
paper
we
investigated
the
effect
of
indomethacin
,
acetazolamide
and
their
combination
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
on
carbonic
anhydrase
(
CA
)
isozymes
.

METHOD
:
In
vitro
experiments
followed
the
effect
of
the
two
substances
at
concentrations
between
10
(
-
8
)
-
10
(
-
4
)
M
on
purified
human
red
cell
CA
I
and
II
as
well
as
on
human
gastric
mucosa
CA
IV
using
dose
-
response
relationships
.

Kinetic
studies
were
also
performed
.

The
effects
of
single
and
combined
administration
of
indomethacin
and
acetazolamide
on
red
cell
CA
and
on
gastric
acid
secretion
were
studied
in
vivo
.

RESULTS
:
Indomethacin
,
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
.
induces
an
increase
in
erythorcyte
CA
I
and
CA
II
activity
.

Acetazolamide
,
a
specific
inhibitor
of
CA
,
reduces
the
activity
of
CA
I
and
CA
II
from
red
cells
.

Indomethacin
completely
antagonizes
CA
activity
,
i
.
e
.
abolishes
the
inhibitory
effect
of
acetazolamide
on
CA
.

In
humans
,
an
increase
or
decrease
in
erythrocyte
CA
II
activity
is
correlated
with
an
increase
or
decrease
in
gastric
acid
secretion
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
Our
results
show
that
indomethacin
,
a
known
cyclooxygenase
(
COX
)
inhibitor
,
is
also
an
activator
of
CA
.

Our
data
also
prove
that
indomethacin
is
not
only
an
activator
of
CA
but
also
antagonizes
the
effect
of
acetazolamide
,
a
specific
inhibitor
of
this
enzyme
.

In
view
of
the
role
of
CA
in
acid
-
base
balance
as
well
as
the
fact
that
an
increase
or
decrease
in
its
activity
is
accompanied
by
an
increase
or
decrease
in
intra
-
and
extracellular
pH
,
our
results
suggest
that
:
firstly
,
CA
activation
induced
by
indomethacin
might
cause
changes
in
COX
activity
;
secondly
,
PGs
are
synthetized
as
a
consequence
of
the
changes
in
COX
activity
,
a
hypothesis
that
requires
further
study
.

The
antipsychotic
drugs
sertindole
and
pimozide
block
erg3
,
a
human
brain
K
(
+
)
channel
.

The
antipsychotic
drugs
sertindole
and
pimozide
are
known
to
prolong
the
QT
interval
on
the
electrocardiogram
via
a
high
affinity
block
of
the
cardiac
K
(
+
)
channel
known
as
HERG
(
human
ether
-
a
-
go
-
go
-
related
gene
;
erg1
)
.

We
wished
to
test
whether
these
drugs
also
displayed
high
affinity
for
the
related
neuronal
K
(
+
)
channel
erg3
.

The
cDNA
encoding
erg3
channel
was
cloned
from
a
human
brain
library
.

Northern
analysis
confirmed
that
the
channel
was
localized
to
brain
relative
to
other
tissues
including
heart
,
liver
and
lung
.

Within
the
brain
,
erg3
was
expressed
in
higher
amounts
in
the
frontal
lobe
and
cerebellum
relative
to
the
temporal
,
parietal
and
occipital
lobes
.

Transient
expression
of
erg3
in
Chinese
hamster
ovary
cells
produced
outwardly
directed
K
(
+
)
currents
that
activated
at
approximately
-
50
mV
and
produced
a
large
transient
component
at
positive
membrane
potentials
.

Inward
tail
currents
measured
at
-
100
mV
were
blocked
in
a
dose
-
dependent
fashion
by
sertindole
resulting
in
an
IC
(
50
)
value
of
43
nM
.

Significant
inhibition
was
observed
at
concentrations
as
low
as
3
nM
.

Block
of
erg3
by
sertindole
also
displayed
a
positive
voltage
-
dependence
.

Pimozide
blocked
erg3
channel
currents
with
an
IC
(
50
)
of
103
nM
and
significant
inhibition
was
noted
at
concentrations
of
10
nM
and
higher
.

We
conclude
that
erg3
can
be
blocked
by
certain
antipsychotic
drugs
like
sertindole
and
pimozide
.

Inhibition
of
erg3
or
related
K
(
+
)
channels
in
the
brain
may
contribute
to
the
efficacy
/
side
effect
profiles
of
some
antipsychotic
drugs
.

Complexities
of
androgen
action
.

Androgens
mediate
a
wide
range
of
processes
during
embryogenesis
and
in
the
adult
.

In
mammals
,
the
principal
androgens
are
testosterone
and
its
5alpha
-
reduced
metabolite
,
5alpha
-
dihydrotestosterone
(
DHT
)
.

Although
these
androgenic
hormones
are
diverse
in
character
,
it
is
believed
that
their
effects
are
mediated
via
the
protein
products
of
a
single
androgen
receptor
gene
encoded
on
the
X
-
chromosome
.

A
great
deal
of
information
has
now
accumulated
pertaining
to
the
mechanisms
by
which
nuclear
receptors
,
such
as
the
androgen
receptor
,
modulate
the
activity
of
responsive
genes
.

The
studies
have
demonstrated
the
participation
of
a
number
of
ancillary
proteins
in
modulating
activation
or
repression
by
nuclear
receptors
.

In
addition
to
studies
focused
on
the
mechanisms
of
nuclear
receptor
function
,
additional
work
has
illuminated
the
mechanism
by
which
androgens
are
metabolized
in
selected
tissues
.

This
information
provides
a
perspective
on
the
number
of
levels
of
complexity
by
which
differential
gene
regulation
by
androgens
may
occur
in
different
tissues
and
in
different
cell
types
.

Binding
site
of
amiloride
to
urokinase
plasminogen
activator
depends
on
species
.

A
novel
drug
candidate
is
checked
on
its
potency
on
animal
models
before
it
can
advance
to
human
phase
of
the
research
.

Usually
negative
results
on
animal
phase
disqualify
it
.

Targeting
specific
enzymes
by
small
chemicals
raises
the
question
about
the
appropriateness
of
this
approach
.

As
an
example
,
the
urokinase
(
uPA
)
is
recognized
as
an
important
enzyme
responsible
for
cancer
metastasis
and
angiogenesis
.

It
is
therefore
important
to
ask
the
question
if
a
small
chemical
will
inhibit
uPA
of
different
species
with
the
same
or
different
potency
.

Using
DNA
sequence
and
known
structure
of
uPA
we
have
modeled
3D
structures
of
uPAs
for
several
different
species
.

By
theoretical
calculations
we
have
determined
most
probable
structure
of
amiloride
/
uPAs
complexes
.

Catalytic
triad
(
B57
,
B102
,
B195
)
and
specificity
pocket
(
B187
-
B197
,
B212
-
B229
)
are
highly
conserved
in
all
cases
,
and
are
the
regions
responsible
for
proteolytic
activity
and
recognition
of
the
substrate
.

Significant
differences
were
observed
in
a
different
region
(
loop
B93
-
B101
)
,
that
we
identified
as
binding
site
of
amiloride
to
the
tissue
plasminogen
activator
(
tPA
)
.

Although
tPA
shares
the
same
function
of
activating
plasminogen
and
it
is
structurally
similar
to
uPA
.

Amiloride
is
a
specific
inhibitor
of
uPA
but
does
not
inhibit
tPA
.

Our
study
shows
that
predicted
position
of
amiloride
depends
on
species
and
in
some
cases
was
located
,
as
expected
,
in
the
specificity
pocket
,
but
in
the
other
cases
close
to
the
loop
B93
-
B101
.

This
location
could
weaken
affinity
of
binding
or
prevent
inhibition
of
uPA
.

Therefore
,
drug
screening
and
elimination
process
based
solely
on
animal
study
,
without
careful
structural
analysis
,
could
lead
to
the
elimination
of
potential
drugs
for
humans
.

The
tyrosine
kinase
inhibitor
ZD1839
(
"
Iressa
"
)
inhibits
HER2
-
driven
signaling
and
suppresses
the
growth
of
HER2
-
overexpressing
tumor
cells
.

The
epidermal
growth
factor
receptor
(
EGFR
)
is
commonly
overexpressed
in
many
human
tumors
and
provides
a
new
target
for
anticancer
drug
development
.

ZD1839
(
"
Iressa
"
)
,
a
quinazoline
tyrosine
kinase
inhibitor
selective
for
the
EGFR
,
has
shown
good
activity
in
preclinical
studies
and
in
the
early
phase
of
clinical
trials
.

However
,
because
it
remains
unclear
which
tumor
types
are
the
best
targets
for
treatment
with
this
agent
,
the
molecular
characteristics
that
correlate
with
tumor
sensitivity
to
ZD1839
have
been
studied
.

In
a
panel
of
human
breast
cancer
and
other
epithelial
tumor
cell
lines
,
HER2
-
overexpressing
tumors
were
particularly
sensitive
to
ZD1839
.

Growth
inhibition
of
these
tumor
cell
lines
was
associated
with
the
dephosphorylation
of
EGFR
,
HER2
,
and
HER3
,
accompanied
by
the
loss
of
association
of
HER3
with
phosphatidylinositol
3
-
kinase
,
and
down
-
regulation
of
Akt
activity
.

These
studies
suggest
that
HER2
-
overexpressing
tumors
are
particularly
susceptible
to
the
inhibition
of
HER
family
tyrosine
kinase
signaling
and
suggest
novel
strategies
to
treat
these
particularly
aggressive
tumors
.

Influence

)
exon

genotype
on

.

We
tested
the
hypothesis
that

of
the

genotype
are
associated
with
(

)

in
patients
during

(
admission

.

DRD2
E8
A
/
A
genotype
was
associated
with
increased
dose
of
tiapride
during
a
9
-
day
detoxification
therapy
and
with
increased
anxiety
and
depression
scores
on
admission
and
2
weeks
later
.

The
findings
suggest
a
pharmacogenetic
influence
of
DRD2
E8
genotype
on
tiapride
efficacy
in
alcohol
withdrawal
.

In
an
earlier
report
,
DRD2
E8
A
/
A
genotype
was
associated
with
reduced
responsiveness
to
the
dopamine
D2
agonist
apomorphine
;
however
,
it
is
not
clear
whether
both
findings
share
the
same
biological
basis
.

Earlier
findings
concerning
association
of
DRD2
E8
A
/
A
with
increased
anxiety
and
depression
are
replicated
for
the
first
time

The
effects
of
mitiglinide
(

,
a

,
on

channels
and

and

.

Mitiglinide
(
KAD
-
1229
)
,
a
new
anti
-
diabetic
drug
,
is
thought
to
stimulate
insulin
secretion
by
closing
the
ATP
-
sensitive
K
+
(
K
(
ATP
)
)
channels
in
pancreatic
beta

cells
.

However
,
its
selectivity
for
the
various
K
(
ATP
)
channels
is
not
known
.

In
this
study
,
we
examined
the
effects
of
mitiglinide
on
various
cloned
K
(
ATP
)
channels
(

reconstituted
in

,
and
compared
them
to
another
meglitinide

related
compound
,

.

Patch

analysis
using

showed
that
mitiglinide
inhibits
the

channel
currents
in
a
dose

manner
(

does
not
significantly
inhibit

and
inhibits

.

Binding
experiments
on
mitiglinide
,
nateglinide
,
and
repaglinide
to
SUR1
expressed
in
COS
-

cells
revealed
that
they
inhibit
the
binding
of
[

glibenclamide
to

(
IC50

280
nM
;
nateglinide
,

;
repaglinide
,

)
,
suggesting
that
they
all
share
a
glibenclamide
binding
site
.

The
insulin

,
tolbutamide
,
and
glibenclamide
in
MIN6

after

were
comparable
to
those
after
chronic
tolbutamide
and

These
results

that
,
similar

Effect
of
fenoterol
-
induced
constitutive
beta
(
2
)
-
adrenoceptor
activity
on
contractile
receptor
function
in
airway
smooth
muscle
.

In
the
present
study
,
we
investigated
the
effect
of
fenoterol
-
induced
constitutive
beta
(
2
)
-
adrenoceptor
activity
on
muscarinic
receptor
agonist
-
and
histamine
-
induced
bovine
tracheal
smooth
muscle
contractions
.

Bovine
tracheal
smooth
muscle
strips
were
incubated
with
10
microM
fenoterol
or
vehicle
for
various
periods
of
time
(
5
,
30
min
,
18
h
)
at
37
degrees
C
.

After
extensive
washout
(
3
h
,
37
degrees
C
)
,
isometric
contractions
were
measured
to
the
full
muscarinic
receptor
agonist
methacholine
,
the
partial
muscarinic
receptor
agonist
4
-
(
m
-
chlorophenyl
-
carbamoyloxy
)
-
2
-
butynyltrimethylammonium
(
McN
-
A
-
343
)
and
histamine
.

Fenoterol
treatment
significantly
reduced
the
sensitivity
(
pEC
(
50
)
)
to
methacholine
in
a
time
-
dependent
manner
,
without
affecting
maximal
contraction
(
E
(
max
)
)
.

Fenoterol
treatment
similarly
reduced
the
pEC
(
50
)
of
McN
-
A
-
343
and
histamine
;
however
,
E
(
max
)
values
were
also
reduced
,
to
approximately
70
%
of
control
after
18
-
h
treatment
.

The
inverse
agonist
timolol
,
having
no
effect
on
control
preparations
,
consistently
restored
the
reduced
pEC
(
50
)
and
E
(
max
)
values
of
the
contractile
agonists
.

Remarkably
,
in
the
presence
of
timolol
the
pEC
(
50
)
values
of
McN
-
A
-
343
and
histamine
in
fenoterol
-
treated
airways
were
significantly
enhanced
compared
to
controls
.

In
conclusion
,
fenoterol
-
induced
constitutive
beta
(
2
)
-
adrenoceptor
activity
reduces
muscarinic
receptor
agonist
-
and
histamine
-
induced
contractions
of
bovine
tracheal
smooth
muscle
,
which
can
be
reversed
by
the
inverse
agonist
timolol
.

Moreover
,
after
beta
(
2
)
-
adrenoceptor
agonist
treatment
,
inverse
agonism
by
beta
-
adrenoceptor
antagonists
may
cause
enhanced
airway
reactivity
to
contractile
mediators
.

Comparison
of
vaginal
aminopeptidase
enzymatic
activities
in
various
animals
and
in
humans
.

The
specific
enzymatic
activity
of
four
different
aminopeptidases
(
aminopeptidase
N
,
leucine
aminopeptidase
,
aminopeptidase
A
and
aminopeptidase
B
)
in
vaginal
homogenates
from
rabbit
,
rat
,
guinea
-
pig
,
sheep
and
humans
was
compared
.

The
purpose
of
the
study
was
to
find
an
appropriate
animal
model
that
can
be
used
in
degradation
studies
of
protein
and
peptide
drugs
.

Different
substrates
were
used
as
the
relative
specific
substrates
for
the
determination
of
aminopeptidase
enzymatic
activity
:
4
-
methoxy
-
2
-
naphthylamide
of
L
-
alanine
for
aminopeptidase
N
,
4
-
methoxy
-
2
-
naphthylamide
of
L
-
leucine
for
leucine
aminopeptidase
,
4
-
methoxy
-
2
-
naphthylamide
of
L
-
glutamic
acid
for
aminopeptidase
A
and
4
-
methoxy
-
2
-
naphthylamide
of
L
-
arginine
for
aminopeptidase
B
.

The
vaginal
aminopeptidase
enzymatic
activity
of
different
species
was
determined
spectrofluorometrically
.

The
inhibition
of
aminopeptidase
activity
in
the
presence
of
bestatin
and
puromycin
inhibitors
was
also
investigated
.

The
results
showed
the
presence
of
aminopeptidase
enzymatic
activity
in
all
vaginal
homogenates
in
the
order
:
sheep
>
guinea
-
pig
>
rabbit
>
or
=
human
>
or
=
rat
.

Based
on
the
results
of
the
hydrolysis
and
inhibition
of
the
4
-
methoxy
-
2
-
naphthylamide
substrates
,
it
was
difficult
to
have
an
exact
decision
on
the
aminopeptidase
type
in
the
vaginal
homogenates
from
the
species
studied
.

It
was
found
that
the
aminopeptidase
activity
in
rat
,
rabbit
and
humans
was
not
statistically
different
.

Therefore
,
we
suggest
that
rats
and
rabbits
could
be
used
as
model
animals
for
vaginal
enzymatic
activity
studies
and
for
determination
of
the
degradation
of
protein
and
peptide
drugs
in
the
vagina
.

Aromatase

for
male
infertility
.

PURPOSE
:
Testosterone
-
to
-
estradiol
ratio
levels
in
infertile
men
improve
during
treatment
with
the
aromatase
inhibitor
,
testolactone
,
and
resulting
changes
in
semen
parameters
.

We
evaluated
the
effect
of
anastrozole
,
a
more
selective
aromatase
inhibitor
,
on
the
hormonal
and
semen
profiles
of
infertile
men
with
abnormal

estradiol
ratios
.

MATERIALS
AND
METHODS
:
A
total
of
140
subfertile
men
with
abnormal
testosterone

estradiol
ratios
were
treated
with
100
to
200
mg

anastrozole
daily
.

Changes
in
testosterone
,
estradiol
,
testosterone

were
evaluated
during

of
the
Klinefelter
syndrome
,
and
presence
of
varicocele
and
/
or
history
of
varicocele

on
treatment
results
was
studied
.

RESULTS
:
Men
treated
with
testolactone
had
an
increase
in

in
subgroups
of
men

,
a

and
those
with

A

During

were
seen
(

.

This
improvement
of
hormonal
parameters
was
noted
for
all
subgroups
except
those
patients
with
the
Klinefelter
syndrome
.

A
total
of
25
oligospermic
men
with

before
and
during

had
an

.

These
changes
were
similar
to
those
observed
in
men
treated
with
testolactone
.

No
significant
difference
in
serum
testosterone
levels
during
treatment
with
testolactone
and
anastrozole
was
observed
.

However
,
the
anastrozole
treatment
group
did
have
a
statistically
better
improvement
of
serum
estradiol
concentration
and
testosterone
-
to
-
estradiol
ratios
(
p

)
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
Men
who
are
infertile
with
a
low
serum
testosterone
-
to
-
estradiol
ratio
can
be
treated
with
an
aromatase
inhibitor
.

With
treatment
,
an
increase
in
testosterone
-
to
-
estradiol
ratio
occurred
in
association
with
increased
semen
parameters
.

Anastrozole
and
testolactone
have
similar
effects
on
hormonal
profiles
and
semen
analysis
.

Anastrazole
appears
to
be
at
least
as
effective
as
testolactone
for
treating
men
with
abnormal
testosterone
-
to
-
estradiol
ratios
,
except
for
the
subset
with
the
Klinefelter
syndrome
,
who
appeared
to
be
more
effectively
treated
with
testolactone
.

Methylenedioxymethamphetamine
decreases
plasmalemmal
and
vesicular
dopamine
transport
:
mechanisms
and
implications
for
neurotoxicity
.

Administration
of
a
high
-
dose
regimen
of
methamphetamine
(
METH
)
rapidly
and
profoundly
decreases
plasmalemmal
and
vesicular
dopamine
(
DA
)
transport
in
the
striatum
,
as
assessed
in
synaptosomes
and
purified
vesicles
,
respectively
.

To
determine
whether
these
responses
were
common
to
other
amphetamines
of
abuse
,
effects
of
methylenedioxymethamphetamine
(
MDMA
)
on
the
plasmalemmal
DA
transporter
(
DAT
)
and
vesicular
monoamine
transporter
-
2
(
VMAT
-
2
)
were
assessed
.

Similar
to
effects
of
METH
reported
previously
,
multiple
high
-
dose
MDMA
administrations
rapidly
(
within
1
h
)
decreased
plasmalemmal
DA
uptake
,
as
assessed
ex
vivo
in
synaptosomes
prepared
from
treated
rats
.

Unlike
effects
of
multiple
METH
injections
,
this
deficit
was
reversed
completely
24
h
after
drug
treatment
.

Also
in
contrast
to
effects
of
multiple
METH
injections
,
1
)
MDMA
caused
little
or
no
decrease
in
binding
of
the
DAT
ligand
WIN35428
,
and
2
)
neither
prevention
of
hyperthermia
nor
prior
depletion
of
DA
prevented
the
MDMA
-
induced
reduction
in
plasmalemmal
DA
transport
.

However
,
a
role
for
phosphorylation
was
suggested
because
pretreatment
with
protein
kinase
C
inhibitors
attenuated
the
deficit
caused
by
MDMA
in
an
in
vitro
model
system
.

In
addition
to
affecting
DAT
function
,
MDMA
rapidly
decreased
vesicular
DA
transport
as
assessed
in
striatal
vesicles
prepared
from
treated
rats
.

Unlike
effects
of
multiple
METH
injections
reported
previously
,
this
decrease
partially
recovered
by
24
h
after
drug
treatment
.

Taken
together
,
these
results
reveal
several
differences
between
effects
of
MDMA
and
previously
reported
METH
on
DAT
and
VMAT
-
2
;
differences
that
may
underlie
the
dissimilar
neurotoxic
profile
of
these
agents
.

Chemoprevention
for
high
-
risk
women
:
tamoxifen
and
beyond
.

The
demonstration
by
the
National
Surgical
Adjuvant
Breast
Project
(
NSABP
)
that
5
years
of
tamoxifen
therapy
is
associated
with
an
approximate
50
%
reduction
in
breast
cancer
incidence
in
high
-
risk
women
was
a
milestone
in
breast
cancer
prevention
.

Because
tamoxifen
is
associated
with
increased
risk
of
side
-
effects
such
as
hot
flashes
,
menstrual
abnormalities
,
uterine
cancer
,
and
thromboembolic
phenomena
,
its
use
will
not
be
advisable
or
acceptable
for
all
high
-
risk
women
.

Women
over
50
years
of
age
appear
to
be
at
highest
risk
for
serious
adverse
events
,
such
as
uterine
cancer
and
thromboembolic
phenomena
.

Individuals
in
whom
tamoxifen
-
associated
breast
cancer
risk
reduction
appears
to
outweigh
risk
of
serious
side
-
effects
include
women
with
prior
in
situ
or
estrogen
receptor
(
ER
)
-
positive
invasive
cancer
,
atypical
hyperplasia
,
and
/
or
women
ages
35
-
49
with
a
calculated
Gail
5
-
year
risk
of

.
7
%
,
hysterectomized
women
aged
50
and
older
with
a
5

Gail

of

,
and
nonhysterectomized
women
aged
50
and
older
with
a

Gail
risk
of

.
0
%
.

It
is
not
yet
clear
whether
tamoxifen
can
reduce
breast
cancer
incidence
in
women
with
BRCA1
and
BRCA2
mutations
,
although
preliminary
evidence
favors
benefit
for
at
least
those
with
a
BRCA2
mutation
.

Raloxifene
is
a
selective
ER
modulator
with
less
uterine
estrogen
agonist
activity
than
tamoxifen
,
and
it
is
hoped
that
it
will
result
in
fewer
uterine
cancers
but
will
be
equally
efficacious
in
reducing
the
risk
of
breast
cancer
.

The
NSABP
is
currently
conducting
a
randomized
study
of
tamoxifen
versus
raloxifene
in
high
-
risk
postmenopausal
women
.

Approximately
one
third
of
invasive
cancers
are
ER
negative
.

Tamoxifen
does
not
reduce
the
incidence
of
ER
-
negative
cancers
,
nor
does
it
appear
to
be
effective
in
preventing
the
appearance
of
one
third
of
ER
-
positive
cancers
.

Priorities
in
prevention
research
are
to
develop
(
a
)
biomarkers
to
refine
short
-
term
risk
assessments
based
on
epidemiologic
models
,
(
b
)
biomarkers
predictive
of
response
to
specific
classes
of
preventive
agents
,
(
c
)
drugs
with
fewer
side
-
effects
and
/
or
effective
in
ER
-
negative
or
ER
-
positive
tamoxifen
-
resistant
precancerous
disease
,
and
(
d
)
efficient
clinical
trial
models
to
assess
new
agent
efficacy
.

Breast
intraepithelial
neoplasia
(
IEN
)
may
be
sampled
by
minimally
invasive
techniques
and
is
an
attractive
short
-
term
risk
biomarker
.

Molecular
abnormalities
observed
in
IEN
may
be
used
to
select
potential
agents
for
testing
/
therapy
,
and
modulation
of
these
abnormalities
may
be
used
in
phase
I
trials
to
select
appropriate
doses
and
in
phase
II
trials
to
assess
response
.

Breast
density
volume
and
certain
serum
markers
such
as
insulin
-
like
growth
factor
-
1
are
also
being
studied
as
potential
risk
and
response
biomarkers
.

Reversal
or
prevention
of
advanced
IEN
as
well
as
modulation
of
other
risk
biomarkers
in
randomized
phase
II
and
phase
III
trials
is
being
evaluated
as
a
means
of
more
efficiently
evaluating
prevention
drugs
in
the
future
.

A
number
of
agents
are
being
developed
that
target
molecular
abnormalities
in
IEN
,
have
fewer
or
different
side
effects
than
tamoxifen
,
and
may
be
effective
in
ER
-
negative
or
tamoxifen
-
resistant
disease
.

Inhibition
of
MCP
-
1
and
MIP
-
2
transcription
and
translation
by
mimosine
in
muscle
tissue
infected
with
the
parasite
Trichinella
spiralis
.

Mimosine
is
a
non
-
toxic
plant
aminoacid
which
is
an
effective
inhibitor
of
DNA
replication
by
acting
at
the
S
-
phase
.

In
this
study
we
infected
mice
with
T
.
spiralis
,
a
nematode
parasite
,
and
studied
the
inflammatory
response
through
the
determination
of
MIP
-
2
,
a
C
-
X
-
C
chemokine
and
MCP
-
1
,
a
C
-
C
chemokine
in
the
inflamed
area
around
the
parasitic
cyst
.

The
animals
were
infected
and
their
diaphragms
were
tested
for
inflammatory
response
.

MCP
-
1
and
MIP
-
2
was
tested
after
1
,
10
,
20
,
30
,
and
40
days
post
inoculation
,
before
and
after
mimosine
treatment
.

The
inflammatory
index
was
calculated
by
counting
the
white
blood
cells
around
the
nematode
cysts
,
while
expression
of
MIP
-
2
and
MCP
-
1
was
calculated
by
ELISA
method
and
transcription
by
Northern
blot
and
RT
-
PCR
.

Here
we
found
that
mimosine
strongly
inhibited
the
inflammatory
index
in
the
diaphragmatic
tissue
at
10
,
20
,
30
and
40
days
post
-
treatment
.

In
these
experiments
,
mimosine
had
no
effect
on
the
number
of
cysts
produced
.

In
addition
,
we
found
that
MCP
-
1
transcription
and
translation
was
completely
inhibited
by
mimosine
,
while
MIP
-
2
transcription
and
translation
was
partially
inhibited
at
30
and
40
days
;
yet
it
was
totally
inhibited

Our
studies
suggest
that
mimosine
has
an
inhibitory
effect
through
the
inhibition
of
cytoplasmatic
serine
hydroxymethyltransferase
altering
the
cell
cycle
of
white
blood
cells
.

This
study
suggests
for
the
first
time
the
premise
that
mimosine
acts
as
an
anti

inflammatory
compound
.

G
protein
-
coupled
receptors
as
direct
targets
of
inhaled
anesthetics
.

The
molecular
pharmacology
of
inhalational
anesthetics
remains
poorly
understood
.

Despite
accumulating
evidence
suggesting
that
neuronal
membrane
proteins
are
potential
targets
of
inhaled
anesthetics
,
most
currently
favored
membrane
protein
targets
lack
any
direct
evidence
for
anesthetic
binding
.

We
report
herein
the
location
of
the
binding
site
for
the
inhaled
anesthetic
halothane
at
the
amino
acid
residue
level
of
resolution
in
the
ligand
binding
cavity
in
a
prototypical
G
protein
-
coupled
receptor
,
bovine
rhodopsin
.

Tryptophan
fluorescence
quenching
and
direct
photoaffinity
labeling
with
[
(

)
C
]
halothane
suggested
an
interhelical
location
of
halothane
with
a
stoichiometry
of
1
(
halothane
/
rhodopsin
molar
ratio
)
.

Radiosequence
analysis
of
[
(
14
)
C
]
halothane
-
labeled
rhodopsin
revealed
that
halothane
contacts
an
amino
acid
residue
(
Trp265
)
lining
the
ligand
binding
cavity
in
the
transmembrane
core
of
the
receptor
.

The
predicted
functional
consequence
,
competition
between
halothane
and
the
ligand
retinal
,
was
shown
here
by
spectroscopy
and
is
known
to
exist
in
vivo
.

These
data
suggest
that
competition
with
endogenous
ligands
may
be
a
general
mechanism
of
the
action
of
halothane
at
this
large
family
of
signaling
proteins
.

Modulation
of
TNF
and
GM
-
CSF
release
from
dispersed
human
nasal
polyp
cells
and
human
whole
blood
by
inhibitors
of
different
PDE
isoenzymes
and
glucocorticoids
.

The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
investigate
the
role
of
the
inhibitors
of
different
PDE
isoenzymes
(
PDE
1
-
5
)
on
the
production
of
two
pro
-
inflammatory
cytokines
-
tumor
necrosis
factor
alpha
(
TNF
)
and
granulocyte
-
macrophage
colony
-
stimulating
factor
(
GM
-
CSF
)
.

Two
in
vitro
models
were
used
to
compare
the
antiinflammatory
properties
of
PDE
inhibitors
with
that
of
glucocorticoids
.

The
effect
on
TNF
release
from
diluted
human
blood
following
lipopolysaccharide
(
LPS
from
Salmonella
abortus
equi
)
stimulation
as
well
as
the
GM
-
CSF
and
TNF
release
from
human
nasal
polyp
cells
following
allergic
stimulation
were
investigated
.

Both
models
proofed
to
be
well
suited
for
the
characterisation
of
the
antiinflammatory
properties
of
new
chemical
entities
.

In
diluted
human
blood
and
dispersed
human
nasal
polyp
cells
the
induced
TNF
release
was
most
potently
suppressed
by
selective
PDE4
inhibitors
.

Amrinone
and
milrinone
,
selective
PDE3
inhibitors
,
suppressed
TNF
secretion
to
a
lesser
extent
.

The
effects
of
theophylline
(
unspecific
PDE
inhibitor
)
,
vinpocetine
(
PDE1
inhibitor
)
,
EHNA
(
PDE2
inhibitor
)
and
the
PDE5
inhibitors
zaprinast
and
E
4021
were
weak
.

In
human
blood
,
the
tested
glucocorticoids
beclomethasone
,
dexamethasone
and
fluticasone
inhibited
the
LPS
induced
TNF
release
potently
in
a
concentration
dependent
manner
,
whereas
in
dispersed
human
nasal
polyp
cells
,
the
effect
of
the
glucocorticoids
on
allergically
induced
TNF
release
,
with
the
exception
of
dexamethasone
,
was
much
less
pronounced
.

Glucocorticoids
were
the
most
potent
inhibitors
of
GM
-
CSF
release
and
the
effect
correlates
well
with
the
affinity
to
the
glucocorticoid
receptor
.

The
selective
PDE
4
inhibitors
,
and
to
a
certain
extent
the
PDE3
inhibitors
amrinone
and
milrinone
,
reduced
the
GM
-
CSF
release
in
a
concentration
dependent
manner
.

In
all
investigations
selective
PDE4
inhibitors
reduced
TNF
release
to
a
much
higher
degree
(
4
-
10
fold
)
than
GM
-
CSF
release
.

Central
5
-
HT3
receptor
stimulation
by
m
-
CPBG
increases
blood
glucose
in
rats
.

The
aim
of
the
present
study
was
to
investigate
the
role
of
central
5
-
HT3
receptors
on
the
control
of
blood
glucose
in
stressed
and
non
-
stressed
rats
in
both
fasted
and
fed
states
.

Adult
Wistar
male
rats
had
each
their
third
ventricle
cannulated
7
days
before
the
experiments
.

Injections
of
m
-
CPBG
,
a
selective
5
-
HT3
receptor
agonist
,
induced
a
significant
increase
in
blood
glucose
in
non
-
stressed
rats
in
both
fasted
and
in
fed
states
.

The
same
procedure
was
unable
to
modify
stress
-
induced
hyperglycemia
.

The
hyperglycemic
effect
of
m
-
CPBG
central
administration
was
blocked
by
pretreatment
with
ondansetron
,
a
specific
5
-
HT3
receptor
antagonist
,
indicating
that
the
effects
here
obtained
with
m
-
CPBG
were
a
result
of
its
interaction
with
5
-
HT3
receptors
.

Third
ventricle
injections
of
ondansetron
alone
were
not
able
to
modify
blood
glucose
in
non
-
stressed
animals
and
did
not
change
the
hyperglycemic
responses
observed
after
immobilization
stress
.

We
conclude
that
pharmacological
activation
of
the
central
5
-
HT3
receptor
induces
a
hyperglycemic
effect
in
non
-
stressed
animals
.

Cysteinyl
leukotriene
-
dependent
interleukin
-
5
production
leading
to
eosinophilia
during
late
asthmatic
response
in
guinea
-
pigs
.

BACKGROUND
:
Allergic
airway
eosinophilia
is
suppressed
by
cysteinyl
leukotriene
(
CysLT
)
receptor
(
CysLT1
receptor
)
antagonists
in
several
species
including
humans
and
guinea
-
pigs
,
suggesting
that
CysLTs
are
directly
or
indirectly
involved
in
induction
of
the
response
.

OBJECTIVE
:
We
examined
the
effect
of
CysLT
antagonists
(
pranlukast
and
MCI
-
826
)
on
antigen
inhalation
-
induced
eosinophilia
in
peripheral
blood
and
lung
,
and
on
IL
-
5
activity
in
serum
during
late
increase
of
airway
resistance
(
late
asthmatic
response
,
LAR
)
in
sensitized
guinea
-
pigs
.

METHODS
:
Guinea
-
pigs
inhaled
ovalbumin
(
OVA
)
+
Al
(
OH
)
3
and
OVA
mists
alternately
for
sensitization
and
challenge
,
respectively
,
once
every
2
weeks
.

At
the
fifth
challenge
,
the
effects
of
CysLT
antagonists
and
an
anti
-
IL
-
5
antibody
(
TRFK
-
5
)
on
the
occurrence
of
LAR
,
and
blood
and
lung
eosinophilia
,
which
appeared
at
5
h
after
challenge
,
were
examined
.

The
time
-
course
of
IL
-
5
activity
in
the
serum
after
the
challenge
was
evaluated
by
measuring
in
vitro
'
eosinophil
survival
prolongation
activity
'
.

The
influence
of
CysLT
antagonists
on
IL
-
5
activity
was
assessed
.

RESULTS
:
CysLT
antagonists
and
TRFK
-
5
completely
abolished
blood
and
lung
eosinophilia
.

LAR
was
suppressed
by
both
MCI
-
826
and
TRFK
-
5
by
40
-
50
%
.

Sera
obtained
from
sensitized
,
challenged
animals
3
h
and
4
h
after
challenge
induced
an
obvious
prolongation
of
eosinophil
survival
.

The
activity
of
the
sera
was
completely
neutralized
by
prior
exposure
to
TRFK
-
5
,
suggesting
that
it
reflected
IL
-
5
activity
.

Increased
IL
-
5
activity
in
the
serum
was
inhibited
by
both
pranlukast
and
MCI
-
826
by
over
90
%
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
CysLTs
produced
after
antigen
provocation
sequentially
induced
IL
-
5
production
from
some
immune
component
cells
via
CysLT1
receptor
activation
.

Thus
,
it
is
likely
that
CysLTs
indirectly
cause
antigen
-
induced
eosinophilia
through
IL
-
5
production
.

Minocycline
inhibits
cytochrome
c
release
and
delays
progression
of
amyotrophic
lateral
sclerosis
in
mice
.

Minocycline
mediates
neuroprotection
in
experimental
models
of
neurodegeneration
.

It
inhibits
the
activity
of
caspase
-
1
,
caspase
-
3
,
inducible
form
of
nitric
oxide
synthetase
(
iNOS
)
and
p38
mitogen
-
activated
protein
kinase
(
MAPK
)
.

Although
minocycline
does
not
directly
inhibit
these
enzymes
,
the
effects
may
result
from
interference
with
upstream
mechanisms
resulting
in
their
secondary
activation
.

Because
the
above
-
mentioned
factors
are
important
in
amyotrophic
lateral
sclerosis
(
ALS
)
,
we
tested
minocycline
in
mice
with
ALS
.

Here
we
report
that
minocycline
delays
disease
onset
and
extends
survival
in
ALS
mice
.

Given
the
broad
efficacy
of
minocycline
,
understanding
its
mechanisms
of
action
is
of
great
importance
.

We
find
that
minocycline
inhibits
mitochondrial
permeability
-
transition
-
mediated
cytochrome
c
release
.

Minocycline
-
mediated
inhibition
of
cytochrome
c
release
is
demonstrated
in
vivo
,
in
cells
,
and
in
isolated
mitochondria
.

Understanding
the
mechanism
of
action
of
minocycline
will
assist
in
the
development
and
testing
of
more
powerful
and
effective
analogues
.

Because
of
the
safety
record
of
minocycline
,
and
its
ability
to
penetrate
the
blood
-
brain
barrier
,
this
drug
may
be
a
novel
therapy
for
ALS
.

Tetrahydrobiopterin
in
nitric
oxide
synthesis
:
a
novel
biological
role
for
pteridines
.

Ever
since
the
discovery
that
(
6R
)
-
5
,
6
,
7
,
8
-
tetrahydro
-
L
-
biopterin
(
BH4
)
is
a
cofactor
of
NOS
,
its
function
has
been
the
object
of
intense
research
and
occasional
controversy
.

Only
in
the
last
couple
of
years
a
consensus
has
been
reached
on
what
constitutes
the
main
role
of
BH4
in
NO
synthesis
.

In
this
review
we
aim
to
provide
an
outline
of
the
various
ways
in
which
BH4
affects
NOS
catalysis
.

First
we
give
a
brief
general
description
of
the
structure
and
catalytic
mechanism
of
NOS
,
with
special
emphasis
on
those
aspects
of
catalysis
that
are
actively
debated
,
and
that
directly
or
indirectly
involve
BH4
.

Foremost
among
those
issues
is
uncoupled
catalysis
,
i
.
e
.
the
NOS
-
catalyzed
oxidation
of
NADPH
in
the
absence
of
substrate
or
pterin
that
does
not
result
in
NO
production
.

We
also
shortly
discuss
the
ongoing
debate
on
whether
NO
is
the
actual
reaction
product
of
NOS
catalysis
,
as
well
as
the
phenomenon
of
NO
-
mediated
autoinhibition
.

We
describe
the
function
of
BH4
in
aromatic
amino
acid
hydroxylation
,
and
discuss
the
allosteric
and
structural
effects
that
BH4
exerts
on
NOS
.

Next
we
turn
our
attention
to
what
is
now
becoming
accepted
as
the
central
function
of
BH4
:
its
capacity
to
act
as
a
1
-
electron
donor
during
reductive
activation
of
the
oxyferrous
complex
of
the
heme
.

Finally
,
we
illustrate
how
BH4
might
transform
the
NOS
dimer
into
an
efficient
S
-
nitrosoglutathione
synthase
,
and
briefly
touch
on
some
more
speculative
aspects
of
the
role
of
BH4
in
NO
synthesis
.

A
comparison
of
the
effects
of
nabumetone
vs
meloxicam
on

.

AIMS
:
To
compare
the
effects

)
,
on

activity
and

.

METHODS
:
Twelve
healthy
volunteers
(
3
male
,
9
female
,
median
age
22
years
)
participated
in
an
open
,

during
1
week
with

.

After
a
second
2
week
wash
-
out
period
,
one
dose
of
indomethacin
50
mg
was
given
as
a
positive
control
to
check
for
NSAID
induced
inhibition
of
platelet
function
.

COX
-
1
inhibition
was
measured
as
percentage
inhibition
of
serum
TXB2
generation
in
clotting
whole
blood
,
and
as
closure
time
with
use
of
the
platelet

.

Data
are
reported
as
median
with
range
.

Paired
variables
were
analysed
using
Wilcoxons
signed
rank
test
.

RESULTS
:
TXB2
levels
decreased
significantly
after
all
three
medications
,
but
percentage
inhibition
after
nabumetone
and
indomethacin
(
88
%
and
97
%
,
respectively
)
was
significantly
higher
than
after
meloxicam
(
63
%
)
(
P
<
0
.
05
)
.

Closure
times
increased
significantly
after
administration
of
all
three
medications
(
P
<
0
.
05
)
.

Increases
in
closure
time
after
administration
did
not
differ
between
nabumetone
and
meloxicam
(
24
%
and
14
%
,
respectively
)
,
but
were
significantly
larger
after
indomethacin
administration
(
63
%
)
(
P
<
0
.
01
)
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
In
the
maximum
registered
dosage
,
nabumetone
inhibits
thromboxane
production
much
more
than
meloxicam
,
signifying
less
COX
-
2
selectivity
of
the
former
.

However
,
both
nabumetone
and
meloxicam
cause
only
minor
impairment
in
platelet
function
in
comparison
with
indomethacin
and
the
difference
between
them
is
not
significant
.

Nonsteroidal

Nonsteroidal
anti

inflammatory
drugs
(
NSAIDs
)
have
been
reported
to
induce
apoptosis
in
a
variety
of
cell
lines
.

In
this
study
,
we
examined
the
effect
of
NSAIDs
on
the
growth
and
apoptosis
of
synovial

from
patients
with
rheumatoid

and
analyzed
the
activation
of

as
a
possible
mechanism

,
and

reduced
cell

and
induced

in

did
not

,
a

also
inhibited
cell
proliferation
,
whereas
it
did
not
cause
apoptosis
.

Rheumatoid

mRNA
,
and
the
PPARgamma
ligands
15
-
deoxy
-
Delta
(
12

)
-
prostaglandin
J
(

)
and
troglitazone
reduced
the
proliferation
and
induced
apoptosis
in
synovial
cells
.

Luciferase
reporter
assay
demonstrated
that
not
only
PPARgamma
ligands
but
also
NSAIDs
,
which
could
induce
apoptosis
,
increased
the
activation
of
PPARgamma
in
synovial
cells
.

Furthermore
,
the
ability
of
NSAIDs
and
PPARgamma
ligands
to
stimulate
the
activation
of
PPARgamma
correlated
with
their
ability
to
decrease
cell
viability
(
r
=
0
.
92
,
p
<

and
ability
to
induce
DNA
fragmentation
(
r
=
0
.
97
,
p
<
0
.
001
)
in
synovial
cells
.

These
results
suggest
that
PPARgamma
is
an
attractive
target
for
induction
of
apoptosis
in
rheumatoid
synovial
cells
and
that
the
activation
of
the
PPARgamma
pathway
is
associated
with
the
apoptotic
action
of
NSAIDs
.

was
shown
to
have
equivalent

We
here
report
on
enzymatic
and
molecular
properties
of
rGAD67

METHODS
:
Studies
were
performed

RESULTS
:
The

and
other

those
of
the
mixed

Renal
failure
associated
with
the
use
of
celecoxib
and
rofecoxib
.

OBJECTIVE
:
Celecoxib
and
rofecoxib
are
two
relatively
new
nonsteroidal
anti
-
inflammatory
drugs
(
NSAIDs
)
that
selectively
inhibit
the
cyclo
-
oxygenase
-
2
(
COX
-
2
)
isoenzyme
at
therapeutic
concentrations
.

The
nephrotoxic
potential
of
selective
COX
-
2
inhibitors
has
not
been
clearly
established
.

This
study
was
conducted
in
order
to
understand
the
association
between
acute
renal
failure
and
the
two
COX
-
2
inhibitors
celecoxib
and
rofecoxib
.

METHODS
:
A
search
was
performed
in
the
US
Food
and
Drug
Administration
'
s
(
FDA
)
Adverse
Event
Reporting
System
(
AERS
)
to
identify
cases
of
renal
failure
submitted
to
the
FDA
.

A
MEDLINE
search
of
the
English
language
literature
was
also
performed
to
identify
published
cases
of
renal
failure
associated
with
celecoxib
and
rofecoxib
.

RESULTS
:
One
hundred
twenty
-
two
and
142
domestic
US
cases
of
celecoxib
and
rofecoxib
-
associated
renal
failure
,
respectively
,
were
identified
in
the
AERS
database
.

The
literature
search
identified
19
cases
of
acute
renal
impairment
in
association
with
celecoxib
and
rofecoxib
.

In
addition
,
drug
regulatory
authorities
in
the
UK
,
Canada
,
and
Australia
have
received
about
50
reports
of
renal
failure
with
celecoxib
and
rofecoxib
.

Descriptive
statistics
of
the
AERS
cases
have
been
summarised
in
this
report
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
Data
from
AERS
and
published
case
reports
suggest
that
use
of
both
these
drugs
is
associated
with
renal
effects
similar
to
that
of
conventional
nonselective
NSAIDs
.

Physicians
should
be
aware
that
serious
or
life
-
threatening
renal
failure
has
been
reported
in
patients
with
normal
or
impaired
renal
function
after
short
-
term
therapy
with
celecoxib
and
rofecoxib
.

Patients
at
greatest
risk
for
renal
injury
are
those
with
pre
-
existing
renal
impairment
,
heart
failure
,
liver
dysfunction
,
those
taking
diuretics
and
/
or
ACE
inhibitors
,
and
the
elderly
.

Kidney
function
should
be
monitored
closely
for
any
signs
of
potential
renal
injuries
soon
after
initiating
treatment
with
these
agents
,
especially
in
high
-
risk
populations
.

In
addition
,
healthcare
practitioners
should
adequately
warn
patients
of
the
signs
and
symptoms
of
serious
renal
toxicity
,
and
of
the
need
for
them
to
see
their
physician
promptly
if
they
occur
.

Celecoxib
and
rofecoxib
are
not
recommended
for
use
in
patients
with
advanced
renal
disease
.

without
simultaneous
administration
of
a

.

We
have
earlier
demonstrated
that
dopamine
stimulates
the
liberation
of
the
prostaglandin
E
(
2
)
(
PGE
(
2
)
)
precursor
,
arachidonic
acid
,
in
Chinese
hamster
ovary
cells
transfected
with
the
rat
dopamine
D
(

receptor
(
long

)
,
also
without
concomitant
administration
of
a
Ca

[
Nilsson

Br
J
Pharmacol
1998
;

]
.

In
the
present
report
,
we
show
that
dopamine
,
under
the
same
conditions
,
also
induces
a
concentration
-
dependent
increase
in
the
production
of
PGE
(
2
)
,
with
a
maximal
effect
of
235
%
at
approximately
100
microM
,
and
with
an
EC
(
50
)
of
794
nM
.

The
effect
was
counteracted
by
the
D
(
2
)
antagonist
eticlopride
,
pertussis
toxin
,
the
inhibitor
of
intracellular
Ca
(

,
incubation
in

)
-
free
experimental

,
and
PKC

obtained
by
chronic
pretreatment
with
the
phorbol

TPA
.

It
was
also
antagonized
by
the
non
-
specific
cyclooxygenase
(
COX
)
inhibitor
,
indomethacin
,
and
by
the
selective
COX
-
2
inhibitor
,
NS
-
398
,
but
not
by
the
specific
COX
-
1
inhibitor
,
valeryl
salicylate
.

Both
the
non
-
specific
phospholipase
A
(
2
)
inhibitor
,
quinacrine
,
and
an
inhibitor
of
cPLA
(
2
)
and
iPLA
(
2
)
,
AACOF3
,
counteracted
the
effect
;
in
contrast
,
a
selective
iPLA
(
2
)
inhibitor
,
BEL
,
and
a
selective
sPLA
(
2
)
inhibitor
,
TAPC
,
were
ineffective
.

No
effects
of
dopamine
were
obtained
in
control
cells
mock
-
transfected
with
the
p3C
vector
only
.

The
results
reinforce
previous
assumptions
that
dopamine
may
interact
with
eicosanoid
metabolism
by
means
of
D
(
2
)
receptor
activation
,
and
implicate
an
involvement
of
cPLA
(
2
)
and
COX
-
2
in
this
effect
.

It
is
suggested
that
measurement
of
dopamine
-
induced
PGE
(
2
)
production
may
serve
as
a
convenient
way
to
study
D
(
2
)
receptor
function
in
vitro
.

Minocycline
markedly
protects
the
neonatal
brain
against
hypoxic
-
ischemic
injury
.

Hypoxic
-
ischemic
brain
injury
in
the
perinatal
period
is
a
major
cause
of
morbidity
and
mortality
.

Presently
,
there
are
no
proven
effective
therapies
with
which
to
safeguard
the
human
neonatal
brain
against
this
type
of
injury
.

Minocycline
,
a
semisynthetic
tetracycline
,
has
been
shown
to
be
neuroprotective
in
certain
adult
ischemic
injury
/
stroke
and
neurodegenerative
disease
models
.

However
,
minocycline
'
s
neuroprotective
effects
have
not
been
assessed
after
insults
to
the
neonatal
brain
.

We
now
report
that
minocycline
administered
either
immediately
before
or
immediately
after
a
hypoxic
-
ischemic
insult
substantially
blocks
tissue
damage
in
a
rodent
model
of
neonatal
hypoxic
-
ischemic
brain
injury
.

Minocycline
treatment
prevents
the
formation
of
activated
caspase
-
3
,
a
known
effector
of
apoptosis
,
as
well
as
the
appearance
of
a
calpain
cleaved
substrate
,
a
marker
of
excitotoxic
/
necrotic
cell
death
.

To
our
knowledge
,
this
is
the
first
report
of
a
systemic
treatment
that
can
be
administered
after
a
hypoxic
-
ischemic
insult
,
which
provides
robust
,
nearly
complete
neuroprotection
to
the
developing
brain
.

Our
data
suggest
that
minocycline
or
a
related
neuroprotective
tetracycline
may
be
a
candidate
to
consider
in
human
clinical
trials
to
protect
the
developing
brain
against
hypoxic
-
ischemic
-
induced
damage
.

A
novel
SCN5A
arrhythmia
mutation
,
M1766L
,
with
expression
defect
rescued
by
mexiletine
.

OBJECTIVE
:
Mutations
in
the
cardiac
sodium
channel
gene
,
SCN5A
,
cause
congenital
long
QT
syndrome
(
LQT3
)
,
Brugada
syndrome
,
idiopathic
ventricular
fibrillation
,
and
conduction
disease
by
distinct
cellular
and
clinical
electrophysiological
phenotypes
.

METHODS
:
Postmortem
molecular
analysis
of
SCN5A
was
conducted
on
an
infant
who
presented
shortly
after
birth
with
self
-
terminating
torsades
de
pointes
.

The
infant
was
treated
with
lidocaine
,
propranolol
,
and
mexiletine
and
was
stable
for
16
months
manifesting
only
a
prolonged
QT
interval
.

The
infant
collapsed
suddenly
following
presumed
viral
gastroenteritis
,
was
found
in
2
:
1
AV
block
,
and
was
subsequently
declared
brain
dead
.

Genomic
DNA
was
subjected
to
SCN5A
mutational
analyses
and
DNA
sequencing
revealing
a
novel
,
spontaneous
germline
missense
mutation
,
M1766L
.

The
M1766L
mutation
was
engineered
into
the
hH1a
clone
by
site
-
directed
mutagenesis
,
transfected
into
embryonic
kidney
cells
(
HEK
-
293
)
,
and
studied
by
voltage
clamp
.

RESULTS
:
The
M1766L
mutation
caused
a
significant
decrease
in
the
sodium
channel
expression
.

Co
-
expression
with
beta1
subunit
,
incubation
at
low
temperature
,
and
most
effectively
incubation
with
mexiletine
partially
'
rescued
'
the
defective
expression
.

In
addition
to
this
pronounced
loss
of
function
,
M1766L
also
showed
a
10
-
fold
increase
in
the
persistent
late
sodium
current
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
These
findings
suggest
that
M1766L
-
SCN5A
channel
dysfunction
may
contribute
to
the
basis
of
lethal
arrhythmias
,
displays
an
overlapping
electrophysiological
phenotype
,
and
represents
the
first
sodium
channelopathy
rescued
by
drug
.

Disposition
of
a
specific
cyclooxygenase
-
2
inhibitor
,
valdecoxib
,
in
human
.

Valdecoxib
is
a
potent
and
specific
inhibitor
of
cyclooxygenase
-
2
,
which
is
used
for
the
treatment
of
rheumatoid
arthritis
,
osteoarthritis
,
and
the
dysmenorrhea
pain
.

Eight
male
human
subjects
each
received
a
single
50
-
mg
oral
dose
of
[
(
14
)
C
]
valdecoxib
.

Urine
,
feces
,
and
blood
samples
were
collected
after
administration
of
the
radioactive
dose
.

Most
of
the
radioactivity
in
plasma
was
associated
with
valdecoxib
and
the
hydroxylated
metabolite
of
valdecoxib
(
M1
)
.

The
estimated
terminal
half
-
life
for
valdecoxib
was
about
7
h
.

About
76
.
1
%
of
the
radioactive
dose
was
recovered
in
urine
and
18
%
of
the
radioactive
dose
was
recovered
in
feces
.

Valdecoxib
was
extensively
metabolized
in
human
,
and
nine
phase
I
metabolites
were
identified
.

The
primary
oxidative
metabolic
pathways
of
valdecoxib
involved
hydroxylation
at
either
the
methyl
group
to
form
M1
or
N
-
hydroxylation
at
the
sulfonamide
moiety
to
form
M2
.

Further
oxidation
of
M1
led
to
the
formation
of
several
other
phase
I
metabolites
.

Oxidative
breakdown
of
the
N
-
hydroxy
sulfonamide
function
group
in
M2
led
to
the
formation
of
corresponding
sulfinic
acid
and
sulfonic
acid
metabolites
.

The
O
-
glucuronide
conjugate
of
M1
and
N
-
glucuronide
conjugate
of
valdecoxib
were
the
major
urinary
metabolites
,
which
accounted
for
23
.
3
and
19
.
5
%
of
the
total
administered
dose
,
respectively
.

The
remaining
urinary
metabolites
were
glucuronide
conjugates
of
other
phase
I
metabolites
.

Only
3
%
of
the
administered
dose
was
recovered
in
urine
as
unchanged
parent
,
suggesting
that
renal
clearance
is
insignificant
for
valdecoxib
.

Absorption
of
valdecoxib
was
excellent
since
the
recovery
of
unchanged
valdecoxib
in
feces
was
<
1
%
of
the
administered
dose
.

Bupropion

dopamine
and
from
rat
hippocampal

preloaded
with
[
(

)
H
]
norepinephrine
.

Bupropion
,
an
efficacious
antidepressant
and
smoking
cessation
agent
,
inhibits
dopamine
and
norepinephrine
transporters
(
DAT
and
NET
,
respectively
)
.

Recently
,
bupropion
has
been
reported
to
noncompetitively
inhibit
alpha3beta2
,
alpha3beta4
,
and
alpha4beta2
nicotinic
acetylcholine
receptors
(
nAChRs
)
expressed
in
Xenopus
oocytes
or
established
cell
lines
.

The
present
study
evaluated
bupropion
-
induced
inhibition
of
native
alpha3beta2
*
and
alpha3beta4
*
nAChRs
using
functional
neurotransmitter

assays

slices
preloaded
with

,
and
nicotine

slices
preloaded
with
[
(

)
H
]
norepinephrine
(
[
(

H
]
NE
)
.

The
mechanism
of
inhibition
was
evaluated
using
Schild
analysis
.

To
eliminate
the
interaction
of
bupropion
with
DAT
or
NET
,
nomifensine
or
desipramine
,
respectively
,
was
included
in
the
superfusion
buffer
.

A
high
bupropion
concentration
(
100
microM
)
elicited
intrinsic
activity
in
the
[
(
3
)
H
]
DA
release
assay
.

However
,
none
of
the
concentrations
(
1
nM
-
100
microM
)
examined
evoked
[
(
3
)
H
]
NE
overflow
and
,
thus
,
were
without
intrinsic
activity
in
this
assay
.

Moreover
,
bupropion
inhibited
both
nicotine
-
evoked
[
(
3
)
H
]
DA
overflow
(
IC
(
50
)
=
1
.
27
microM
)
and
nicotine
-
evoked
[
(
3
)
H
]
NE
overflow
(
IC
(
50
)
=
323
nM
)
at
bupropion
concentrations
well
below
those
eliciting
intrinsic
activity
.

Results
from
Schild
analyses
suggest
that
bupropion
competitively
inhibits
nicotine
-
evoked
[
(
3
)
H
]
DA
overflow
,
whereas
evidence
for
receptor
reserve
was
obtained
upon
assessment
of
bupropion
inhibition
of
nicotine
-
evoked
[
(
3
)
H
]
NE
overflow
.

Thus
,
bupropion
acts
as
an
antagonist
at
alpha3beta2
*
and
alpha3beta4
*
nAChRs
in
rat
striatum
and
hippocampus
,
respectively
,
across
the
same
concentration
range
that
inhibits
DAT
and
NET
function
.

The
combination
of
nAChR
and
transporter
inhibition
produced
by
bupropion
may
contribute
to
its
clinical
efficacy
as
a
smoking
cessation
agent
.

The
clinical
profile
of
the
angiotensin
II
receptor
blocker
eprosartan
.

Angiotensin
II
receptor
antagonists
block
angiotensin
II
type
1
(
AT1
)
receptors
and
reduce
the
pressor
effects
of
angiotensin
in
the
vasculature
.

By
this
mechanism
,
they
induce
similar
pharmacological
effects
to
angiotensin
-
converting
enzyme
(
ACE
)
inhibitors
,
resulting
in
a
lowering
of
blood
pressure
(
BP
)
.

However
,
AT1
antagonists
differ
from
ACE
inhibitors
with
respect
to
side
effects
,
and
induce
less
cough
,
which
is
related
to
bradykinin
activation
.

Within
the
class
of
angiotensin
II
antagonists
,
eprosartan
differs
from
other
currently
clinically
available
agents
in
terms
of
its
chemical
structure
and
its
dual
pharmacological
mode
of
action
.

Eprosartan
acts
not
only
at
vascular
AT1
receptors
but
also
at
presynaptic
AT1
receptors
,
causing
inhibition
of
sympathetically
stimulated
noradrenaline
release
.

Eprosartan
is
not
metabolized
by
cytochrome
P450
enzymes
and
therefore
has
a
low
potential
for
metabolic
drug
interactions
,
which
may
be
of
importance
when
treating
the
elderly
and
patients
on
multiple
drugs
.

In
clinical
trials
eprosartan
has
proven
to
be
at
least
as
effective
as
the
ACE
inhibitor
enalapril
in
reducing
BP
,
but
with
a
significantly
lower
incidence
of
side
effects
.

Eprosartan
is
safe
,
effective
and
well
tolerated
in
long
-
term
treatment
,
either
as
monotherapy
or
in
combination
with
other
antihypertensive
drugs
such
as
hydrochlorothiazide
.

Species
-
specific
differences
in
the
glucocorticoid

transactivation
function
upon

with
betamethasone

esters
.

Glucocorticoids
(
GCs
)
are
the
most
effective
drugs
for
anti
-
inflammatory
diseases
.

A
number
of
adverse
side
effects
,
however
,
limit
chronic
treatment
with
GCs
.

To
improve
their
therapeutic
usefulness
,
attempts
have
been
made
to
dissociate
the
two
main
actions
of
the
glucocorticoid
receptor
(
GR
)
,
transactivation
and
transrepression
,
which
are
believed
to
be
responsible
for
the
side
effects
and
anti
-
inflammatory
effects
,
respectively
.

We
report
here
species
-
specific
differences
in
the
transactivation
response
mediated
by
GR
.

Dexamethasone
(
DEX
)
,
betamethasone
(
BM
)
,
and
their
esterified
-
derivatives
had
full
transrepression
agonistic
activity
in
a
reporter
assay
using
CV
-
1
cells
transfected
with
either
human
or
rat
GR
.

These
GCs
also
had
full
transactivation
agonistic
activity
in
CV
-
1
cells
transfected
with
human
GR
.

The
esterified
-
BM
,
however
,
had
only
partial
transactivation
agonistic
activity
in
cells
transfected
with
rat
GR
,
whereas
BM
and
esterified
-
DEX
had
full
transactivation
agonistic
activity
.

Moreover
,
in
rat
hepatoma
H4
-
II
-
E
cells
,
the
esterified
-
BM
failed
to
induce
tyrosine
aminotransferase
,
which
is
regulated
by
GR
-
mediated
transactivation
activity
.

There
were
no
significant
differences
between
the
binding
affinity
of
these
GCs
to
human
and
rat
GR
.

Consistent
with
the
weak
transactivation
activity
of
esterified
-
BM
mediated
by
rat
GR
,
there
were
few
side
effects
,
evaluated
by
thymus
involution
and
body
weight
loss
,
in
an
antigen
-
induced
asthmatic
model
in
rats
.

These
results
suggest
that
the
potency
of
esterified
-
BM
to
induce
transactivation
activity
is
different
between
species
and
that
this
difference
is
not
due
to
differences
in
receptor
binding
.

Biosynthesis
of
iron
-
sulphur
clusters
is
a
complex
and
highly
conserved
process
.

Iron
-
sulphur
(
[
Fe
-
S
]
)
clusters
are
simple
inorganic
prosthetic
groups
that
are
contained
in
a
variety
of
proteins
having
functions
related
to
electron
transfer
,
gene
regulation
,
environmental
sensing
and
substrate
activation
.

In
spite
of
their
simple
structures
,
biological
[
Fe
-
S
]
clusters
are
not
formed
spontaneously
.

Rather
,
a
consortium
of
highly
conserved
proteins
is
required
for
both
the
formation
of
[
Fe
-
S
]
clusters
and
their
insertion
into
various
protein
partners
.

Among
the
[
Fe
-
S
]
cluster
biosynthetic
proteins
are
included
a
pyridoxal
phosphate
-
dependent
enzyme
(
NifS
)
that
is
involved
in
the
activation
of
sulphur
from
l
-
cysteine
,
and
a
molecular
scaffold
protein
(
NifU
)
upon
which
[
Fe
-
S
]
cluster
precursors
are
formed
.

The
formation
or
transfer
of
[
Fe
-
S
]
clusters
appears
to
require
an
electron
-
transfer
step
.

Another
complexity
is
that
molecular
chaperones
homologous
to
DnaJ
and
DnaK
are
involved
in
some
aspect
of
the
maturation
of
[
Fe
-
S
]
-
cluster
-
containing
proteins
.

It
appears
that
the
basic
biochemical
features
of
[
Fe
-
S
]
cluster
formation
are
strongly
conserved
in
Nature
,
since
organisms
from
all
three
life
Kingdoms
contain
the
same
consortium
of
homologous
proteins
required
for
[
Fe
-
S
]
cluster
formation
that
were
discovered
in
the
eubacteria
.

Gemfibrozil

,
inhibits
the
induction

in

astrocytes
.

Gemfibrozil
,
a
lipid
-
lowering
drug
,
inhibited
cytokine
-
induced
production
of
NO
and
the
expression
of
inducible
nitric
-
oxide
synthase
(
iNOS
)
in
human
U373MG
astroglial
cells
and
primary
astrocytes
.

Similar
to
gemfibrozil
,
clofibrate
,
another
fibrate
drug
,
also
inhibited
the
expression
of
iNOS
.

Inhibition
of
human
iNOS
promoter
-
driven
luciferase
activity
by
gemfibrozil
in
cytokine
-
stimulated
U373MG
astroglial
cells
suggests
that
this
compound
inhibits
the
transcription
of
iNOS
.

Since
gemfibrozil
is
known
to
activate
peroxisome
proliferator
-
activated
receptor
-
alpha
(
PPAR
-
alpha
)
,
we
investigated
the
role
of
PPAR
-
alpha
in
gemfibrozil
-
mediated
inhibition
of
iNOS
.

Gemfibrozil
induced
peroxisome
proliferator
-
responsive
element
(
PPRE
)
-
dependent
luciferase
activity
,
which
was
inhibited
by
the
expression
of
DeltahPPAR
-
alpha
,
the
dominant
-
negative
mutant
of
human
PPAR
-
alpha
.

However
,
DeltahPPAR
-
alpha
was
unable
to
abrogate
gemfibrozil
-
mediated
inhibition
of
iNOS
suggesting
that
gemfibrozil
inhibits
iNOS
independent
of
PPAR
-
alpha
.

The

,
and

)
;
therefore
,
we
investigated
the
effect
of
gemfibrozil
on
the
activation
of
these
transcription
factors
.

The
combination
of
interleukin
(
IL
)
-
1beta
and
IFN
-
gamma
induced
the
activation
of
NF
-
kappaB
,
AP
-
1
,
C
/
EBPbeta
,
and
GAS
but
not
that
of
ISRE
,
suggesting
that
IRF
-
1
may
not
be
involved
in
cytokine
-
induced
expression
of
iNOS
in
human
astrocytes
.

Interestingly
,
gemfibrozil
strongly
inhibited
the
activation
of
NF
-
kappaB
,
AP
-
1
,
and
C
/
EBPbeta
but
not
that
of
GAS
in
cytokine
-
stimulated
astroglial
cells
.

These
results
suggest
that
gemfibrozil
inhibits
the
induction
of
iNOS
probably
by
inhibiting
the
activation
of
NF
-
kappaB
,
AP
-
1
,
and
C
/
EBPbeta
and
that
gemfibrozil
,
a
prescribed

for
humans
,
may
further
find
its
therapeutic
use
in

Re

of

pharmacology
:
5
-
hydroxytryptamine1A
receptor
-
mediated
behavioral
effects
overlap
its
other
properties
in
rats
.

RATIONALE
:
There
is
substantial
evidence
that
lisuride
can
produce
effects
linked
to
5
-
HT
(
1A
)
receptor
occupancy
.

Nevertheless
,
this
action
has
generally
been
ignored
in
the
mechanism
of
action
of
lisuride
,
in
favor
of
an
exclusive
role
for
dopamine
receptors
in
considering
its
antiparkinsonian
effects
,
or
an
exclusive
role
of
5
-
HT
(
2A
/
2C
)
receptor
activation
in
hallucinogenesis
.

These
conclusions
are
surprising
when
one
considers
that
the
potent
interaction
of
lisuride
with
5
-
HT
(
1A
)
receptors
has
been
demonstrated
in
several
different
laboratories
and
that
activation
of
5
-
HT
(
1A
)
and
5
-
HT
(
1B
)
receptors
can
modulate
dopaminergically
mediated
responses
.

OBJECTIVE
:
The
lack
of
full
substitution
of
lisuride
for
lysergic
acid
diethylamide
(
LSD
)
in
drug
discrimination
experiments
and
induction
of
a
pronounced
5
-
HT
syndrome
by
this
compound
at
relatively
low
doses
convinced
us
to
execute
two
series
of
experiments
that
might
explain
the
primary
mechanism
responsible
for
lisuride
-
mediated
biological
effects
and
its
paradoxical
classification
as
a
dopamine
agonist
in
the
literature
.

RESULTS
:
In
drug
discrimination
studies
,
lisuride
fully
mimicked
the
5
-
HT
(
1A
)
agonist
LY
293284
,
only
partially
substituted
for
LSD
and
DOI
,
and
failed
to
substitute
for

)
-

.

Lisuride
produced
a
significant
dose
-
related
increase
in
flat
body
posture
,
forepaw
treading
,
and
lower
-
lip
retraction
which
reflect
a
modulation
of
behavior
by
action
at
central

(

)
receptors
.

,
a
selective

(

antagonist
,
was
effective
in
inhibiting
all
5
-
HT
syndrome
behaviors
produced
by
lisuride
,
whereas
pMPPI
was
without
effect
on
any
behavior
induced
by

.

Lisuride
dose
dependently
decreased
body

in
rats
with
a
potency
similar
to
that
of
the
selective
5
-
HT
(
1A
)
agonist
LY
293284
.

The
hypothermic
effect
of
lisuride
was
prevented
by
pre
-
injection
of
pMPPI
,
but
not
by
ketanserin
or
haloperidol
.

CONCLUSION
:
We
have
demonstrated
that
the
behavioral
effects
of
low
doses
of
lisuride
are
clearly
mediated
by
stimulation
of
5
-

Stereospecific
inhibition
of
monoamine
uptake
transporters
by
meta
-
hydroxyephedrine
isomers
.

Meta
-
hydroxyephedrine
(
HED
)
comprises
four
stereoisomers
consisting
of
two
enantiomeric
pairs
related
to
ephedrine
and
pseudoephedrine
.

HED
is
transported
into
adrenergic
neurons
and
radiolabeled
HED
has
been
employed
in
positron
emission
tomography
(
PET
)
to
image
adrenergic
neurons
in
vivo
.

To
extend
structure
-
activity
analyses
of
binding
sites
within
monoamine
transporters
and
to
determine
which
stereoisomer
displayed
the
best
selectivity
for
PET
imaging
applications
,
we
tested
the
HED
compounds
for
their
abilities
to
inhibit
[
(
3
)
H
]
neurotransmitter
uptake
into
platelets
,
transfected
cells
,
and
chromaffin
vesicles
.

We
hypothesized
that
the
HED
compounds
would
be
most
potent
at
the
norepinephrine
transporter
(
NET
)
compared
to
the
serotonin
or
dopamine
transporters
and
that
the
1R
diastereomers
would
be
more
effective
than
1S
diastereomers
.

Supporting
the
hypotheses
,
all
stereoisomers
were
most
potent
at
the
NET
and
the
1R
,
2S
stereoisomer
was
the
most
potent
inhibitor
overall
.

However
,
the
1S
,
2R
isomer
may
be
preferred
for
PET
applications
because
of
better
selectivity
among
the
transporters
and
reduced
neuronal
recycling

which
is
the
S
-
enantiomer
of
citalopram
,
is
in
clinical
development
worldwide
for
the
treatment
of
depression
and
anxiety
disorders
.

Preclinical
studies
demonstrate
that
the
therapeutic
activity
of
citalopram
resides
in
the
S
-
isomer
and
that
escitalopram
binds
with
high
affinity
to
the
human
serotonin
transporter
.

Conversely
,
R
-
citalopram
is
approximately
30
-
fold
less
potent
than
escitalopram
at
this
transporter
.

Escitalopram
has
linear
pharmacokinetics
,
so
that
plasma
levels
increase
proportionately
and
predictably
with
increased
doses
and
its
half
-
life
of
27
-
32
h
is
consistent
with
once
-
daily
dosing
.

In
addition
,
escitalopram
has
negligible
effects
on
cytochrome
P450
drug
-
metabolising
enzymes
in
vitro
,
suggesting
a
low
potential
for
drug
-
drug
interactions
.

The
efficacy
of
escitalopram
in
patients
with
major
depressive
disorder
has
been
demonstrated
in
multiple
short
-
term
,
placebo
-
controlled
clinical
trials
,
three
of
which
included
citalopram
as
an
active
control
,
as
well
as
in
a
36
-
week
study
evaluating
efficacy
in
the
prevention
of
depression
relapse
.

In
these
studies
,
escitalopram
was
shown
to
have
robust
efficacy
in
the
treatment
of
depression
and
associated
symptoms
of
anxiety
relative
to
placebo
.

Efficacy
has
also
been
shown
in
treating
generalised
anxiety
disorder
,
panic
disorder
and
social
anxiety
disorder
.

Results
also
suggest
that
,
at
comparable
doses
,
escitalopram
demonstrates
clinically
relevant
and
statistically
significant
superiority
to
placebo
treatment
earlier
than
citalopram
.

Analysis
of
the
safety
database
shows
a
low
rate
of
discontinuation
due
to
adverse
events
,
and
there
was
no
statistically
significant
difference
between
escitalopram
10
mg
/
day
and
placebo
in
the
proportion
of
patients
who
discontinued
treatment
early
because
of
adverse
events
.

The
most
common
adverse
events
associated
with
escitalopram
which
occurred
at
a
rate
greater
than
placebo
include
nausea
,
insomnia
,
ejaculation
disorder
,
diarrhoea
,
dry
mouth
and
somnolence
.

Only
nausea
occurred
in
>
10
%
of
escitalopram
-
treated
patients
.

Formation
of
Mallory
body
-
like
inclusions
and
cell
death
induced
by
deregulated
expression
of
keratin
18
.

Mallory
bodies
(
MBs
)
are
cytoplasmic
inclusions
that
contain
keratin
8
(
K8
)
and
K18
and
are
present
in
hepatocytes
of
individuals
with
alcoholic
liver
disease
,
nonalcoholic
steatohepatitis
,
or
benign
or
malignant
hepatocellular
neoplasia
.

Mice
fed
long
term
with
griseofulvin
are
an
animal
model
of
MB
formation
.

However
,
the
lack
of
a
cellular
model
has
impeded
understanding
of
the
molecular
mechanism
of
this
process
.

Culture
of
HepG2
cells
with
griseofulvin
has
now
been
shown
to
induce
both
the
formation
of
intracellular
aggregates
containing
K18
as
well
as
an
increase
in
the
abundance
of
K18
mRNA
.

Overexpression
of
K18
in
HepG2
,
HeLa
,
or
COS
-
7
cells
also
induced
the
formation
of
intracellular
aggregates
that
stained
with
antibodies
to
ubiquitin
and
with
rhodamine
B
(
characteristics
of
MBs
formed
in
vivo
)
,
eventually
leading
to
cell
death
.

The
MB
-
like
aggregates
were
deposited
around
centrosomes
and
disrupted
the
microtubular
array
.

Coexpression
of
K8
with
K18
restored
the
normal
fibrous
pattern
of
keratin
distribution
and
reduced
the
toxicity
of
K18
.

In
contrast
,
an
NH
(
2
)
-
terminal
deletion
mutant
of
K8
promoted
the
formation
of
intracellular
aggregates
even
in
the
absence
of
K18
overexpression
.

Deregulated
expression
of
K18
,
or
an
imbalance
between
K8
and
K18
,
may
thus
be
an
important
determinant
of
MB
formation
,
which
compromises
the
function
of
centrosomes
and
the
microtubule
network
and
leads
to
cell
death
.

Cyclooxygenase
and
5
-
lipoxygenase
inhibitors
protect
against
mononuclear
phagocyte
neurotoxicity
.

Neuroinflammation
and
oxidative
stress
are
believed
to
be
contributing
factors
to
neurodegeneration
in
normal
aging
,
as
well
as
in
age
-
related
neurological
disorders
.

Reactive
microglia
are
found
in
increased
numbers
in
aging
brain
and
are
prominently
associated
with
lesions
in
such
age
-
related
degenerative
conditions
as
Alzheimer
'
s
disease
(
AD
)
,
Parkinson
'
s
disease
(
PD
)
and
amyotrophic
lateral
sclerosis
(
ALS
)
.

In
vitro
,
stimulated
microglia
or
microglial
-
like
cells
secrete
neurotoxic
materials
and
are
generators
of
free
radicals
through
their
respiratory
burst
system
.

Agents
that
suppress
microglial
activation
are
therefore
candidates
for
neuroprotection
.

We
have
developed
quantitative
in
vitro
assays
for
measuring
neurotoxicity
of
microglia
or
other
mononuclear
phagocytes
.

Neuronal
like
SH
-
SY5Y
cells
are
cultured
in
supernatants
from
activated
cells
of
the
human
monocytic
THP
-
1
line
and
their
survival
is
followed
.

Respiratory
burst
is
directly
measured
on
the
activated
cells
.

We
tested
inhibitors
of
the
cyclooxygenase
(
COX
)
or
the
5
-
lipoxygenase
(
5
-
LOX
)
pathways
as
possible
neuroprotective
agents
.

The
COX
pathway
generates
inflammatory
prostaglandins
,
while
the
5
-
LOX
pathway
generates
inflammatory
leukotrienes
.

We
found
that
inhibitors
of
both
these
pathways
suppressed
neurotoxicity
in
a
dose
-
dependent
fashion
.

They
included
the
COX
-
1
inhibitor
indomethacin
;
the
COX
-
2
inhibitor
NS
-
398
;
the
mixed
COX
-
1
/
COX
-
2
inhibitor
ibuprofen
;
the
nitric
oxide
(
NO
)
derivatives
of
indomethacin
,
ibuprofen
and
flurbiprofen
;
the
5
-
LOX
inhibitor
REV
5901
;
and
the
5
-
LOX
activating
protein
(
FLAP
)
inhibitor
MK
-
886
.

The
FLAP
inhibitor
also
reduced
respiratory
burst
activity
in
a
more
potent
manner
than
indomethacin
.

Combinations
of
COX
and
5
-
LOX
inhibitors
were
more
effective
than
single
inhibitors
.

The
data
suggest
that
both
COX
inhibitors
and
5
-
LOX
inhibitors
may
be
neuroprotective
in
vivo
by
suppressing
toxic
actions
of
microglia
/
macrophages
,
and
that
combinations
of
the
two
might
have
greater
therapeutic
potential
than
single
inhibitors
of
either
class
.

MDMA
-
and
p
-
chlorophenylalanine
-
induced
reduction
in
5
-
HT
concentrations
:
effects
on
serotonin
transporter
densities
.

Low
levels
of
serotonin
may
reduce
the
density
of
the
serotonin
transporter
(
SERT
)
by
either
increasing
trafficking
or
reducing
synthesis
;
a
"
neuroadaptive
response
"
.

To
determine
whether
3
,
4
-
methylenedioxymethamphetamine
(
MDMA
)
-
induced
reductions
in
SERT
density
could
be
related
to
such
a
mechanism
,
p
-
chlorophenylalanine
or
MDMA
was
administered
to
rats
,
and
brain
serotonin
and
SERT
density
were
measured
.

As
expected
,
both
treatments
led
to
serotonin
depletion
1
,
7
and
14
days
later
.

However
,
only
MDMA
reduced
SERT
density
.

This
observation
suggests
that
MDMA
-
induced
reductions
in
SERT
density
do
not
represent
neuroadaptive
responses
to
decreased
levels
of
brain
serotonin
,
but
may
occur
in
response
to
some
other
stimulus
or
to
the
neurotoxic
effects
of
MDMA
.

Atomoxetine
increases
extracellular
levels
of
norepinephrine
and
dopamine
in
prefrontal
cortex
of
rat
:
a
potential
mechanism
for
efficacy
in
attention
deficit
/
hyperactivity
disorder
.

The
selective
norepinephrine
(
NE
)
transporter
inhibitor
atomoxetine
(
formerly
called
tomoxetine
or
LY139603
)
has
been
shown
to
alleviate
symptoms
in
Attention
Deficit
/
Hyperactivity
Disorder
(
ADHD
)
.

We
investigated
the
mechanism
of
action
of
atomoxetine
in
ADHD
by
evaluating
the
interaction
of
atomoxetine
with
monoamine
transporters
,
the
effects
on
extracellular
levels
of
monoamines
,
and
the
expression
of
the
neuronal
activity
marker
Fos
in
brain
regions
.

Atomoxetine
inhibited
binding
of
radioligands
to
clonal
cell
lines
transfected
with
human
NE
,
serotonin
(
5
-
HT
)
and
dopamine
(
DA
)
transporters
with
dissociation
constants
(
K
(
i
)
)
values
of
5
,
77
and
1451
nM
,
respectively
,
demonstrating
selectivity
for
NE
transporters
.

In
microdialysis
studies
,
atomoxetine
increased
extracellular
(
EX
)
levels
of
NE
in
prefrontal
cortex
(
PFC
)
3
-
fold
,
but
did
not
alter
5
-
HT
(
EX
)
levels
.

Atomoxetine
also
increased
DA
(
EX
)
concentrations
in
PFC
3
-
fold
,
but
did
not
alter
DA
(
EX
)
in
striatum
or
nucleus
accumbens
.

In
contrast
,
the
psychostimulant
methylphenidate
,
which
is
used
in
ADHD
therapy
,
increased
NE
(
EX
)
and
DA
(
EX
)
equally
in
PFC
,
but
also
increased
DA
(
EX
)
in
the
striatum
and
nucleus
accumbens
to
the
same
level
.

The
expression
of
the
neuronal
activity
marker
Fos
was
increased
3
.
7
-
fold
in
PFC
by
atomoxetine
administration
,
but
was
not
increased
in
the
striatum
or
nucleus
accumbens
,
consistent
with
the
regional
distribution
of
increased
DA
(
EX
)
.

We
hypothesize
that
the
atomoxetine
-
induced
increase
of
catecholamines
in
PFC
,
a
region
involved
in
attention
and
memory
,
mediates
the
therapeutic
effects
of
atomoxetine
in
ADHD
.

In
contrast
to
methylphenidate
,
atomoxetine
did
not
increase
DA
in
striatum
or
nucleus
accumbens
,
suggesting
it
would
not
have
motoric
or
drug
abuse
liabilities
.

Pharmacological

rasagiline
;

Rasagiline
[
N

1R
(

)
-
aminoindan
;
TVP1012
]
is
a
potent
irreversible
monoamine

inhibitor
with
selectivity
for
type
B
of
the
enzyme
,
which
is
being
developed
for
treatment
of
Parkinson

.

In
this

we
examined

of
behavioural
response
to
L

did

following

of
both

by
tranylcypromine
together
with
the
monoamine
precursors
.

Following
oral
administration
,
levels
of
noradrenaline
(
NA
)
,
5
-
hydroxytryptamine
(
5
-
HT
)
and
dopamine
(

were
unaffected
in
hippocampus
and
striatum
after
single
doses
of
rasagiline
up
to
2
mg

(

.

Following
chronic
oral
administration
(
21
days
,
one
dose
daily
)
,
levels
of
NA
,
5

hippocampus
and

were
unaffected
by
rasagiline
at
doses
up
to
1
mg

(

.

Rasagiline
does
not
modify
CNS

at
doses
which
selectively
inhibit

L
-
proline
accumulation
and
freeze
tolerance
of
Saccharomyces
cerevisiae
are
caused
by
a
mutation
in
the
PRO1
gene
encoding
gamma
-
glutamyl
kinase
.

We
previously
isolated
a
mutant
which
showed
a
high
tolerance
to
freezing
that
correlated
with
higher
levels
of
intracellular
L
-
proline
derived
from
L
-
proline
analogue
-
resistant
mutants
.

The
mutation
responsible
for
the
analogue
resistance
and
L
-
proline
accumulation
was
a
single
nuclear
dominant
mutation
.

By
introducing
the
mutant
-
derived
genomic
library
into
a
non
-
L
-
proline
-
utilizing
strain
,
the
mutant
was
found
to
carry
an
allele
of
the
wild
-
type
PRO1
gene
encoding
gamma
-
glutamyl
kinase
,
which
resulted
in
a
single
amino
acid
replacement
;
Asp
(
GAC
)
at
position
154
was
replaced
by
Asn
(
AAC
)
.

Interestingly
,
the
allele
of
PRO1
was
shown
to
enhance
the
activities
of
gamma
-
glutamyl
kinase
and
gamma
-
glutamyl
phosphate
reductase
,
both
of
which
catalyze
the
first
two
steps
of
L
-
proline
synthesis
from
L
-
glutamate
and
which
together
may
form
a
complex
in
vivo
.

When
cultured
in
liquid
minimal
medium
,
yeast
cells
expressing
the
mutated
gamma
-
glutamyl
kinase
were
found
to
accumulate
intracellular
L
-
proline
and
showed
a
prominent
increase
in
cell
viability
after
freezing
at
-
20
degrees
C
compared
to
the
viability
of
cells
harboring
the
wild
-
type
PRO1
gene
.

These
results
suggest
that
the
altered
gamma
-
glutamyl
kinase
results
in
stabilization
of
the
complex
or
has
an
indirect
effect
on
gamma
-
glutamyl
phosphate
reductase
activity
,
which
leads
to
an
increase
in
L
-
proline
production
in
Saccharomyces
cerevisiae
.

The
approach
described
in
this
paper
could
be
a
practical
method
for
breeding
novel

Eprosartan
for
the
treatment
of
hypertension
.

Antihypertensive
agents
are
proven
to
reduce
the
cardiovascular
risk
of
stroke
,
coronary
heart
disease
and
cardiac
failure
.

The
ideal
antihypertensive
agent
should
control
all
grades
of
hypertension
and
have
a
placebo
-
like
side
effect
profile
.

Angiotensin
II
(
AII
)
receptor
antagonists
are
a
relatively
new
class
of
antihypertensive
agent
that
block
AII
Type
1
(
AT
(
1
)
)
receptors
,
and
reduce
the
pressor
effects
of
AII
in
the
vasculature
.

By
this
mechanism
,
they
induce
similar
pharmacological
effects
compared
with
angiotensin
-
converting
enzyme
(
ACE
)
inhibitors
,
resulting
in
a
lowering
of
blood
pressure
.

However
,
AII
receptor
blockers
differ
from
ACE
inhibitors
with
respect
to
side
effects
,
and
induce
less
cough
,
a
side
effect
which
may
be
related
to
bradykinin
or
other
mediators
such
as
substance
P
.

Within
the
class
of
AII
blockers
,
eprosartan
differs
from
other
currently
available
agents
in
terms
of
chemical
structure
,
as
it
is
a
non
-
biphenyl
,
non
-
tetrazole
,
non
-
peptide
antagonist
with
a
dual
pharmacological
mode
of
action
.

Eprosartan
acts
at
vascular
AT
(
1
)
receptors
(
postsynaptically
)
and
at
presynaptic
AT
(
1
)
receptors
,
where
it
inhibits
sympathetically
stimulated
noradrenaline
release
.

Its
lack
of
metabolism
by
cytochrome
P450
enzymes
confers
a
low
potential
for
metabolic
drug
interactions
and
may
be
of
importance
when
treating
elderly
patients
and
those
on
multiple
drugs
.

In
clinical
trials
,
eprosartan
has
been
demonstrated
to
be
at
least
as
effective
in
reducing
blood
pressure
as
the
ACE
inhibitor
enalapril
,
and
has
significantly
lower
side
effects
.

Eprosartan
is
safe
,
effective
and
well
-
tolerated
in
long
-
term
treatment
,
either
as
a
monotherapy
or
in
combination
with
other
antihypertensive
drugs
such
as
hydrochlorothiazide
.

by
serine
racemase
,
a
pyridoxal
5
'

phosphate
-
dependent
enzyme
expressed
mainly
in
brain
and
liver
.

NMDA
receptor
overactivation
has
been
implicated
in
a
number
of
pathological
conditions
and
inhibitors
of
serine
racemase
are
thus
potentially
interesting
targets
for
therapy
.

We
expressed
recombinant
mouse
serine
racemase
in
insect
cells
and
purified
it
to
near
homogeneity
.

The
enzyme
is
a
non
-
covalent
homodimer
in
solution
and
requires
divalent
cations
Mg
(
2

)
,
Ca
(
2

)
or
Mn
(
2
+
)
for
activity
but
not
for
dimerization
.

In
addition
to
the
racemization
it
also
catalyzes
specific
elimination
of
L
-
Ser
to
pyruvate
.

D
-
Serine
is
eliminated
much
less
efficiently
.

Both
L
-
serine
racemization
and
elimination
activities
of
serine
racemase
are
of
comparable
magnitude
,
display
alkaline
pH
optimum
and
are
negligible
below
pH

Colorectal

is
the

Nonsteroidal

results
in

of
several

effectors
,
including
the
proapoptotic

Bad
.

Phosphorylation
of
Ser112
by
ERK1

inactivates
Bad
and
protects
the
tumor
cell
from

.

Sulindac
metabolites
and
other
nonsteroidal
anti
-
inflammatory
drugs
selectively
inhibit
ERK1

phosphorylation
in
human
colon

cells
.

In
this
study
we
show
that
epidermal
growth
factor
(
EGF
)
strongly
induces
phosphorylation
of
ERK1
/
2
and
Bad
in
HT29
colon
cancer
cells
.

EGF
-
stimulated
phosphorylation
of
ERK
and
Bad
is
blocked
by
pretreatment
with
U0126
,
a
selective
MAP
kinase
kinase
(
MKK
)
1

inhibitor
.

Similarly
,
pretreatment
with
sulindac
sulfide
blocks
the
ability
of
EGF
to
induce
ERK1

2
and
Bad
phosphorylation
,
but
also
down
-
regulates

protein
levels
.

The
ability
of
sulindac
to
block
ERK1

2
signaling
by
the
EGF
receptor
may
account
for
at
least
part
of
its

:
a
unique
molecule
that
reduces
body
weight
and
ameliorates
metabolic
abnormalities
.

OBJECTIVE
:
Preclinical
evaluation
of
DRF
2655
,
a
peroxisome
proliferator
-
activated
receptor
alpha
(
PPARalpha
)
and
PPARgamma
agonist
,
as
a
body
-
weight
lowering
,
hypolipidemic
and
euglycemic
agent
.

RESEARCH
METHODS
AND
PROCEDURES
:
DRF
2655
was
studied
in
different
genetic
,
normal
,
and
hyperlipidemic
animal
models
.

HEK
293
cells
were
used
to
conduct
the
reporter
-
based
transactivation
of
PPARalpha
and
PPARgamma
.

To
understand
the
biochemical
mechanism
of
lipid

,
and
glucose
-
lowering
effects
,
activities
of
key
beta

oxidation
and
lipid
catabolism
enzymes
and
gluconeogenic
enzymes
were
studied
in
db
/
db
mice
treated
with
DRF
2655
.

3T3L1
cells
were
used
for
adipogenesis
study
,
and
HepG2
cells
were
used
to
study
the
effect
of
DRF
2655
on
total
cholesterol
and
triglyceride
synthesis
using
[
(
14
)
C
]
acetate
and
[
(

)
H
]
glycerol
.

RESULTS
:
DRF
2655
showed
concentration
-
dependent
transactivation
of
PPARalpha
and
PPARgamma
.

In
the
3T3L1
cell
-
differentiation
study
,
DRF
2655
and
rosiglitazone
showed
369
%
and
471
%
increases
,
respectively
,
in
triglyceride
accumulation
.

DRF
2655
showed
body

weight
lowering
and
euglycemic
and
hypolipidemic
effects
in
various
animal
models
.

db

treated
with
DRF
2655
showed
5

fold
inhibition
in
phosphoenolpyruvate
carboxykinase
and
glucose

phosphatase
activity
and
651
%
and
77
%
increases
in
the
beta

oxidation
enzymes
carnitine
palmitoyltransferase
and
carnitine
acetyltransferase
,
respectively
.

HepG2
cells
treated
with
DRF
2655
showed
significant
reduction
in
lipid
synthesis
.

DISCUSSION
:
DRF
2655
showed
excellent
euglycemic
and
hypolipidemic
activities
in
different
animal
models
.

An
exciting
finding
is
its
body
-
weight
lowering
effect
in
these
models
,
which
might
be
mediated
by
the
induction
of
target
enzymes
involved
in
hepatic
lipid
catabolism
through
PPARalpha
activation
.

Gonadotropin
-
releasing
hormone
receptor
gene
expression
during
pubertal
development
of
male
rats
.

Appropriate
expression
of
the
GnRH
receptor
(
GnRH
-
R
)
in
gonadotropes
is
critical
for
GnRH
signaling
and
hence
for
gonadotropin
secretion
and
sexual
development
.

In
the
present
work
,
we
have
studied
the
ontogeny
of
the
steady
-
state
GnRH
-
R
mRNA
levels
in
pituitaries
of
male
rats
from
Day
5
to
Day
55
,
when
sexual
maturity
is
attained
.

Developmental
changes
of
gonadotropin
subunit
(
alpha
,
FSHbeta
,
and
LHbeta
)
mRNA
levels
were
also
assessed
.

In
addition
,
the
role
of
the
endogenous
GnRH
on
the
maturational
changes
of
GnRH
-
R
and
gonadotropin
subunit
gene
expression
was
investigated
.

Messenger
RNA
levels
were
determined
by
Northern
blot
analysis
of
total
RNA
from
anterior
pituitaries
.

Amounts
of
the
most
abundant
(
5
.
0
kb
)
GnRH
-
R
mRNA
increased
slowly
from
Day
5
through
the
infantile
and
the
juvenile
periods
,
to
peak
at
Day
35
(
12
-
fold
increase
vs
.
Day
5
)
.

Thereafter
,
the
levels
of
the
GnRH
-
R
mRNA
decline
slightly
until
Day
55
(
33
%
decrease
vs
.
Day
35
)
.

Parallel
changes
were
observed
on
the
4
.
5
-
kb
transcript
of
the
GnRH
-
R
gene
.

Alpha
subunit
mRNA
was
easily
detected
at
Day
5
,
and
its
levels
increased
progressively
through
the
infantile
period
(
2
.
5
-
fold
increase
)
and
peaked
at
Day
25
(
3
.
3
-
fold
increase
vs
.
Day
5
)
with
a
smooth
nonstatistically
significant
increment
until
Day
35
;
then
it
decreased
by
41
.
5
%
at
Day
55
.

FSHbeta
and
LHbeta
mRNA
levels
rose
slowly
until
Day
25
.

A
sharp
rise
occurred
thereafter
to
reach
maximum
levels
at
Day
35
(
5
.
8
-
fold
for
FSHbeta
and
3
.
8
-
fold
for
LHbeta
vs
.
Day
25
)
.

Thereafter
,
the
levels
of
both
mRNAs
fell
until
Day
55
(
44
.
1
%
decrease
for
FSHbeta
and
37
.
1
%
decrease
for
LHbeta
vs
.
Day
35
)
.

To
ascertain
whether
developmental
activation
of
the
GnRH
-
R
and
gonadotropin
subunit
gene
expression
is
GnRH
dependent
,
we
have
studied
the
effect
of
blocking
the
endogenous
GnRH
action
by
treating
developing
male
rats
with
the
specific
GnRH
antagonist
cetrorelix
(
1
.
5
mg
/
kg
body
weight
/
week
,
s
.
c
.
)
through
the
infantile
(
Days
5
-
20
)
and
the
juvenile
periods
(
Days
20
-
35
)
.

Cetrorelix
completely
blocked
the
rise
of
levels
of
the
two
most
abundant
species
,
5
.
0
kb
and
4
.
5
kb
,
of
the
GnRH
-
R
mRNA
,
during
both
the
infantile
and
the
juvenile
periods
.

Cetrorelix
also
abolished
the
developmental
rise
of
the
gonadotropin
beta
subunit
mRNAs
during
the
two
periods
of
the
study
.

In
contrast
,
the
alpha
subunit
gene
expression
was
not
altered
by
cetrorelix
treatment
during
any
of
the
two
periods
.

These
data
demonstrate
that
sexual
maturation
of
male
rats
is
accompanied
by
a
progressive
and
concerted
induction
of
GnRH
-
R
and
gonadotropin
subunit
gene
expression
.

Developmental
activation
of
GnRH
-
R
and
gonadotropin
beta
subunit
genes
is
GnRH
dependent
.

The
apparent
GnRH
-
independent
regulation
of
the
alpha
-
glycoprotein
subunit
mRNA
levels
may
be
due
to
the
contribution
of
thyrotropes
and
perhaps
to
the
presence
of
exclusive
regulatory
signals
for
this
gene
.

Long
-
term
use
of
sildenafil
.

The
treatment
of
erectile
dysfunction
(
ED
)
has
been
revolutionised
by
new
agents
to
inhibit
the
enzyme
PDE5
.

The
scientific
basis
of
this
treatment
of
ED
includes
relaxation
of
the
corpus
cavernosum
smooth
muscle
tissue
by
inhibition
of
PDE5
that
breaks
down
cGMP
,
the
key
pathway
for
the
production
of
erectile
function
in
humans
.

Many
clinical
studies
,
both
pre
-
and
post
-
marketing
,
have
demonstrated
the
clinical
efficacy
and
safety
of
sildenafil
(
Viagra
,
Pfizer
)
-
the
first
approved
selective
PDE
inhibitor
for
the
treatment
of
ED
.

Sildenafil
is
inhibitory
of
PDE5
at
a
rate
tenfold
higher
than
for
the
next
PDE
(
PDE6
)
,
which
produces
visual
changes
through
the
retinal
rods
.

Its
clinical
effectiveness
has
been
well
documented
in
the
majority
of
men
with
ED
irrespective
of
aetiology
.

The
aetiology
of
ED
,
also
,
does
not
appear
to
effect
the
function
of
sildenafil
in
relaxing
corpus
cavernosum
smooth
muscle
tissue
.

Adverse
events
are
usually
associated
with
the
vascular
changes
from
PDE5
inhibition
.

These
include
headache
and
flushing
.

Each
of
these
adverse
events
,
however
,
declines
with
medication
use
.

With
the
use
of
sildenafil
,
it
has
been
clearly
,
clinically
demonstrated
that
the
selective
inhibition
of
PDE5
is
an
appropriate
,
effective
,
safe
method
for
the
treatment
of
ED
of
all
aetiologies
and
severities
.

Effects
of
serine

threonine
protein
phosphatase
inhibitors
on
morphine
-
induced
antinociception
in
the
tail
flick
test
in
mice
.

The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
evaluate
the
effects
of
serine
/
threonine
protein
phosphatase
(
PP
)
inhibitors
on
morphine
-
induced
antinociception
in
the
tail

test
in
mice
,
and
on
[
3H
]
naloxone
binding
to
the
forebrain
crude
synaptosome
fraction
.

Neither
okadaic
acid
nor
cantharidin
(
1
-
10000
nM
)
displaced
[
3H
]
naloxone
from
its
specific
binding
sites
,
which
indicates
that
they
do
not
interact
at
the
opioid
receptor
level
.

The
i

c

administration
of
very
low
doses
of
okadaic
acid
(
0

)
and
cantharidin
(
0

,
which
inhibit
PP2A
,
produced
a
dose

antagonism
of
the
antinociception
induced
by
morphine
(

)
.

However

,
an
analogue
of
okadaic

against

,
did
not
affect
the
antinociceptive
effect
of
morphine
.

On
the

of
okadaic

)
,
which
inhibits
equally
both
PP1
and
PP2A
,
did
not
modify
the
morphine

induced
antinociception
.

These
results
suggest
that
the
activation
of
type
2A
serine
/
threonine
protein
phosphatases
may
play
a
role
in
the
antinociceptive
effect
of
morphine
,
and
that
PP1
might
counterbalace
this
activity
.

Cloning

.

The

data
reported
will
appear
in
DDBJ
,
EMBL

GenBank
(

and

;
the
sequences
of
ovine
CPT1A
and
CPT1B
cDNAs
have
the
accession
numbers
Y18387
and
AJ272435
respectively
and

and

respectively
.

Fatty
acid
and
ketone
body
metabolism
differ
considerably
between
monogastric
and
ruminant
species
.

The
regulation
of
the
key
enzymes
involved
may
differ
accordingly
.

Carnitine
palmitoyltransferase
1
(
CPT
1
)
is
the
key
locus
for
the
control
of
long
-
chain
fatty
acid
beta
-
oxidation
and
liver
ketogenesis
.

Previously
we
showed
that
CPT
1
kinetics
in
sheep
and
rat
liver
mitochondria
differ
.

We
cloned
cDNAs
for
both
isoforms
[
liver
-
(
L
-
)
and
muscle
-
(
M
-
)
]
of
ovine
CPT
1
in
order
to
elucidate
the
structural
features
of
these
proteins
and
their
genes
(
CPT1A
and
CPT1B
)
.

Their
deduced
amino
acid
sequences
show
a
high
degree
of
conservation
compared
with
orthologues
from
other
mammalian
species
,
with
the
notable
exception
of
the
N
-
terminus
of
ovine
M
-
CPT
1
.

These
differences
were
also
present
in
bovine
M
-
CPT
1
,
whose
N
-
terminal
sequence
we
determined
.

In
addition
,
the
5
'
-
end
of
the
sheep
CPT1B
cDNA
suggested
a
different
promoter
architecture
when
compared
with
previously
characterized
CPT1B
genes
.

Northern
blotting
revealed
differences
in
tissue
distribution
for
both
CPT1A
and
CPT1B
transcripts
compared
with
other
species
.

In
particular
,
ovine
CPT1B
mRNA
was
less
tissue
restricted
,
and
the
predominant
transcript
in
the
pancreas
was
CPT1B
.

Expression
in
yeast
allowed
kinetic
characterization
of
the
two
native
enzymes
,
and
of
a
chimaera
in
which
the
distinctive
N
-
terminal
segment
of
ovine
M
-
CPT
1
was
replaced
with
that
from
rat
M
-
CPT
1
.

The
ovine
N
-
terminal
segment
influences
the
kinetics
of
the
enzyme
for
both
its
substrates
,
such
that
the
K
(
m
)
for
palmitoyl
-
CoA
is
decreased
and
that
for
carnitine
is
increased
for
the
chimaera
,
relative
to
the
parental
ovine
M
-
CPT
1
.

Thyroid
hormone
receptors
/
THR
genes
in
human
cancer
.

Thyroid
hormone
(
triiodothyronine
,
T3
)
is
a
pleiotropic
regulator
of
growth
,
differentiation
and
tissue
homeostasis
in
higher
organisms
that
acts
through
the
control
of
target
gene
expression
.

Most
,
if
not
all
,
major
T3
actions
are
mediated
by
specific
high
affinity
nuclear
receptors
(
TR
)
which
are
encoded
by
two
genes
,
THRA
and
THRB
.

Several
TRalpha
and
TRbeta
receptor
isoforms
are
expressed
.

Abundant
and
contradictory
literature
exists
on
the
relationship
between
circulating
thyroid
hormone
levels
,
thyroid
diseases
and
human
cancer
.

In
1986
,
a
connection
between
TR
and
cancer
became
evident
when
the
chicken
TRalpha1
was
characterized
as
the
c
-
erbA
proto
-
oncogene
,
the
cellular
counterpart
of
the
retroviral

In
recent
years
,
many
studies
have
analyzed
the
presence
of
quantitative
(
abnormal
levels
)
or
qualitative
(
mutations
)
alterations
in
the
expression
of
THR
genes
in
different
types
of
human
neoplasias
.

While
their
role
in
tumor
generation
or
progression
is
currently
unclear
,
both
gross
chromosomal
and
minor
mutations
(
deletions
,
aberrant
splicing
,
point
mutations
)
and
changes
in
the
level
of
expression
of
THRA
and
THRB
genes
have
been
found
.

Together
with
other
in

data
indicating
connections
between
TR
and
p53
,
Rb
,
cyclin
D
and
other
cell
cycle
regulators
and
oncogenes
,
these
results
suggest
that
THRA
and
THRB
may
be
involved
in
human
cancer
.

Investigating
the
regulation
of
one
-
carbon
metabolism
in
Arabidopsis
thaliana
.

Serine
(
Ser
)
biosynthesis
in
C
(

)
plants
can
occur
via
several
pathways
.

One
major
route
involves
the
tetrahydrofolate
(
THF
)
-
dependent
activities
of
the
glycine
decarboxylase
complex
(
GDC
,
EC
2
.

.

)
and
serine
hydroxymethyltransferase
(
SHMT
,
EC

.

)
with
glycine
(
Gly
)
as
one
-
carbon
(
1
-
C
)
source
.

An
alternative
THF
-
dependent
pathway
involves
the
C1
-
THF
synthase
/
SHMT
activities
with
formate
as
1
-
C
source
.

Here
,
we
have
investigated
aspects
of
the
regulation
of
these
two
folate
-
mediated
pathways
in
Arabidopsis
thaliana
(
L
.
)
Heynh
.

Columbia
using
two
approaches
.

Firstly
,
transgenic
plants
overexpressing
formate
dehydrogenase
(
FDH
,
EC
1
.
2
.
1
.
2
)
were
used
to
continue
our
previous
studies
on
the
function
of
FDH
in
formate
metabolism
.

The
formate
pool
size
was
approximately
73
nmol
(
g
FW
)
(
-
1
)
in
wild
type
(
WT
)
Arabidopsis
plants
;
three
independent
transgenic
lines
had
similar
-
sized
pools
of
formate
.

Transgenic
plants
produced
more
(
13
)
CO
(
2
)
from
supplied
[
(
13
)
C
]
formate
than
did
WT
plants
but
were
not
significantly
different
from
WT
plants
in
their
synthesis
of
Ser
.

We
concluded
that
FDH
has
no
direct
role
in
the
regulation
of
the
above
two
pathways
of
Ser
synthesis
;
the
breakdown
of
formate
to
CO
(
2
)
by
the
FDH
reaction
is
the
primary
and
preferred
fate
of
the
organic
acid
in
Arabidopsis
.

The
ratio
between
the
GDC
/
SHMT
and
C1

THF

/
SHMT
pathways
of
Ser

from
[
alpha

(
13
)
C
]
Gly
and
[
(
13
)
C
]
formate
,
respectively
,
in
Arabidopsis
shoots
was
21
:
1
;
in
roots
,
9
:
1
.

In
shoots
,
therefore
,
the
pathway
from
formate
plays
only
a
small
role
in
Ser
synthesis
;
in
the
case
of
roots
,
results
indicated
that
the
9
:
1
ratio
was
as
a
result
of
greater
fluxes
of
(
13
)
C
through
both
pathways
together
with
a
relatively
higher
contribution
from
the
C1
-
THF
synthase
/
SHMT
route
than
in
shoots
.

We
also
examined
the
synthesis
of
Ser
in
a
GDC
-
deficient
mutant
of
Arabidopsis
(
glyD
)
where
the
GDC
/
SHMT
pathway
was
impaired
.

Compared
with
WT
,
glyD
plants
accumulated
5
-
fold
more
Gly
than
WT
after
supplying
[
alpha
-
(
13
)
C
]
Gly
for
24
h
;
the
accumulation
of
Ser
from
[
alpha
-
(
13
)
C
]
Gly
was
reduced
by
25
%
in
the
same
time
period
.

On
the
other
hand
,
the
accumulation
of
Ser
through
the
C1
-
THF
synthase
/
SHMT
pathway
in
glyD
plants
was
2
.
5
-
fold
greater
than
that
in
WT
plants
.

Our
experiments
confirmed
that
the
GDC
/
SHMT
and
C1
-
THF
synthase
/
SHMT
pathways
normally
operate
independently
in
Arabidopsis
plants
but
that
when
the
primary
GDC
/
SHMT
pathway
is
impaired
the
alternative
C1
-
THF
synthase
/
SHMT
pathway
can
partially
compensate
for
deficiencies
in
the
synthesis
of
Ser
.

Methionine
adenosyltransferase
II
beta
subunit
gene
expression
provides
a
proliferative
advantage
in
human
hepatoma
.

BACKGROUND
&
AIMS
:
Of
the
2
genes
(
MAT1A
,
MAT2A
)
encoding
methionine
adenosyltransferase
,
the
enzyme
that
synthesizes
S
-
adenosylmethionine
,
MAT1A
,
is
expressed
in
liver
,
whereas
MAT2A
is
expressed
in
extrahepatic
tissues
.

In
liver
,
MAT2A
expression
associates
with
growth
,
dedifferentiation
,
and
cancer
.

Here
,
we
identified
the
beta
subunit
as
a
regulator
of
proliferation
in
human
hepatoma
cell
lines
.

The
beta
subunit
has
been
cloned
and
shown
to
lower
the
K
(
m
)
of
methionine
adenosyltransferase
II
alpha2
(
the
MAT2A
product
)
for
methionine
and
to
render
the
enzyme
more
susceptible
to
S
-
adenosylmethionine
inhibition
.

METHODS
:
Methionine
adenosyltransferase
II
alpha2
and
beta
subunit
expression
was
analyzed
in
human
and
rat
liver
and
hepatoma
cell
lines
and
their
interaction
studied
in
HuH7
cells
.
beta
Subunit
expression
was
up
-
and
down
-
regulated
in
human
hepatoma
cell
lines
and
the
effect
on
DNA
synthesis
determined
.

RESULTS
:
We
found
that
beta
subunit
is
expressed
in
rat
extrahepatic
tissues
but
not
in
normal
liver
.

In
human
liver
,
beta
subunit
expression
associates
with
cirrhosis
and
hepatoma
.
beta
Subunit
is
expressed
in
most
(
HepG2
,
PLC
,
and
Hep3B
)
but
not
all
(
HuH7
)
hepatoma
cell
lines
.

Transfection
of
beta
subunit
reduced
S
-
adenosylmethionine
content
and
stimulated
DNA
synthesis
in
HuH7
cells
,
whereas
down
-
regulation
of
beta
subunit
expression
diminished
DNA
synthesis
in
HepG2
.

The
interaction
between
methionine
adenosyltransferase
II
alpha2
and
beta
subunit
was
demonstrated
in
HuH7
cells
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
Our
findings
indicate
that
beta
subunit
associates
with
cirrhosis
and
cancer
providing
a
proliferative
advantage
in
hepatoma
cells
through
its
interaction
with
methionine
adenosyltransferase
II
alpha2
and
down
-

of
S
-
adenosylmethionine
levels

Cloning
and
expression
of
a
heme
binding
protein
from
the
genome
of
Saccharomyces
cerevisiae
.

The
YLR205c
gene
of
Saccharomyces
cerevisiae
does
not
show
significant
sequence
identity
to
any
known
gene
,
except
for
heme
oxygenase
(
22
%
to
human
HO
-
1
)
.

The
YLR205
ORF
was
cloned
and
overexpressed
in
both
Escherichia
coli
and
S
.
cerevisiae
.

Both
expression
systems
yielded
proteins
that
bound
heme
tightly
.

The
isolated
YLR205c
protein
underwent
reduction
in
the
presence
of
either
NADPH
-
cytochrome
P450
reductase
or
NADH
-
putidaredoxin
-
putidaredoxin
reductase
but
did
not
exhibit
heme
oxygenase
activity
.

The
protein
exhibited
modest
H
(
2
)
O
(
2
)
-
dependent
peroxidase
activities
with
guaiacol
,
potassium
iodide
,
and
2
,
2
(
'
)
-
azino
-
bis
(
3
-
ethylbenzothiazoline
-
6
-
sulfonic
acid
(
ABTS
)
.

Thus
,
YLR205c
codes
for
a
hemoprotein
of
unknown
physiological
function
that
exhibits
peroxidase
activity
.

GluR5
kainate
receptors
,
seizures
,
and
the
amygdala
.

The
amygdala
is
a
critical
brain
region
for
limbic
seizure
activity
,
but
the
mechanisms
underlying
its
epileptic
susceptibility
are
obscure
.

Several
lines
of
evidence
implicate
GluR5
(
GLU
(
K5
)
)
kainate
receptors
,
a
type
of
ionotropic
glutamate
receptor
,
in
the
amygdala
'
s
vulnerability
to
seizures
and
epileptogenesis
.

GluR5
mRNA
is
abundant
in
temporal
lobe
structures
including
the
amygdala
.

Brain
slice
recordings
indicate
that
GluR5
kainate
receptors
mediate
a
portion
of
the
synaptic
excitation
of
neurons
in
the
rat
basolateral
amygdala
.

Whole
-
cell
voltage
-
clamp
studies
demonstrate
that
GluR5
kainate
receptor
-
mediated
synaptic
currents
are
inwardly
rectifying
and
are
likely
to
be
calcium
permeable
.

Prolonged
activation
of
basolateral
amygdala
GluR5
kainate
receptors
results
in
enduring
synaptic
facilitation
through
a
calcium
-
dependent
process
.

The
selective
GluR5
kainate
receptor
agonist
ATPA
induces
spontaneous
epileptiform
bursting
that
is
sensitive
to
the
GluR5
kainate
receptor
antagonist
LY293558
.

Intra
-
amygdala
infusion
of
ATPA
in
the
rat
induces
limbic
status
epilepticus
;
in
some
animals
,
recurrent
spontaneous
seizures
occur
for
months
after
the
ATPA
treatment
.

Together
,
these
observations
indicate
that
GluR5
kainate
receptors
have
a
unique
role
in
triggering
epileptiform
activity
in
the
amygdala
and
could
participate
in
long
-
term
plasticity
mechanisms
that
underlie
some
forms
of
epileptogenesis
.

Accordingly
,
GluR5
kainate
receptors
represent
a
potential
target
for
antiepileptic
and
antiepileptogenic
drug
treatments
.

Most
antiepileptic
drugs
do
not
act
through
effects
on
glutamate
receptors
.

However
,
topiramate
at
low
concentrations
causes
slow
inhibition
of
GluR5
kainate
receptor
-
mediated
synaptic
currents
in
the
basolateral
amygdala
,
indicating
that
it
may
protect
against
seizures
,
at
least
in
part
,
through
suppression
of
GluR5
kainate
receptor
responses
.

Properties
of
purified
recombinant
human
polyamine
oxidase
,
PAOh1
/
SMO
.

The
discovery
of
an
inducible
oxidase
whose
apparent
substrate
preference
is
spermine
indicates
that
polyamine
catabolism
is
more
complex
than
that
originally
proposed
.

To
facilitate
the
study
of
this
enzyme
,
the
purification
and
characterization
of
the
recombinant
human
PAOh1
/
SMO
polyamine
oxidase
are
reported
.

Purified
PAOh1
/
SMO
oxidizes
both
spermine
(
K
(
m
)
=
1
.
6
microM
)
and
N
(
1
)
-
acetylspermine
(
K
(
m
)
=
51
microM
)
,
but
does
not
oxidize
spermidine
.

The
purified
human
enzyme
also
does
not
oxidize
eight
representative
antitumor
polyamine
analogues
;
however
,
specific
oligamine
analogues
were
found
to
be
potent
inhibitors
of
the
oxidation
of
spermine
by
PAOh1
/
SMO
.

The
results
of
these
studies
are
consistent
with
the
hypothesis
that
PAOh1
/
SMO
represents
a
new
addition
to
the
polyamine
metabolic
pathway
that
may
represent
a
new
target
for
antineoplastic
drug
development
.

Altered
methionine
metabolism
in
long
living
Ames
dwarf
mice
.

Ames
dwarf
mice
(
df
/
df
)
are
deficient
in
growth
hormone
,
prolactin
,
and
thyroid
-
stimulating
hormone
and
live
significantly
longer
than
their
normal
siblings
.

In
the
current
study
,
we
found
that
the
hormone
deficiencies
affect
methionine
metabolism
.

We
previously
reported
that
the
dwarf
mice
exhibit
enzyme
activities
and
levels
that
combat
oxidative
stress
more
efficiently
than
those
of
normal
mice
.

Moreover
,
methionine
or
metabolites
of
methionine
are
involved
in
antioxidative
processes
.

Thus
,
we
performed
an
experiment
that
compared
various
parameters
of
methionine
metabolism
between
18
-
month
old
male
dwarf
(
N
=
6
)
and
wild
type
(
N
=
5
)
mice
.

The
specific
activity
of
liver
methionine
adenosyltransferase
(
MAT
)
was
significantly
elevated
(
205
%
,
p
<
0
.
0001
)
in
the
dwarf
mice
,
as
were
cystathionine
synthase
(
50
%
,
p
<
0
.
01
)
,
cystathionase
(
83
%
,
p
<
0
.
001
)
,
and
glycine
N
-
methyltransferase
(
GNMT
,
91
%
,
p
<
0
.
001
)
activities
.

Even
though
the
activities
of
MAT
and
GNMT
were
elevated
,
the
concentration
of
liver
S
-
adenosylmethionine
was
decreased
(
24
%
,
p
<
0
.
001
)
and
S
-
adenosylhomocysteine
increased
(
113
%
,
p
<
0
.
001
)
in
the
dwarf
mice
.

These
data
indicate
that
dwarf
mice
,
compared
to
wild
type
mice
,
have
a
markedly
different
metabolism
of
methionine
.

Altered
methionine
metabolism
may
partially
explain
earlier
reports
indicating
less
oxidative
damage
to
proteins
in
dwarf
mice
.

Taken
together
,
the
data
suggest
that
methionine
metabolism
may
play
a
role
in
oxidative
defense
in
the
dwarf
mouse
and
should
be
studied
as
a
potential
mechanism
of
extended
lifespan
.

Biosynthetic
regulation
and
intracellular
transport
of
phosphatidylserine
in
mammalian
cells
.

In
mammalian
cells
,
phosphatidylserine
(
PtdSer
)
is
synthesized
through
the
action
of
the
endoplasmic
reticulum
enzymes
,
PtdSer
synthase
1
and
2
,
and
the
decarboxylation
of
PtdSer
accounts
for
the
majority
of
phosphatidylethanolamine
(
PtdEtn
)
synthesis
.

PtdSer
decarboxylation
for
PtdEtn
formation
occurs
in
the
mitochondria
.

In
addition
,
the
transport
of
PtdSer
from
the
endoplasmic
reticulum
to
the
mitochondria
is
probably
a
rate
limiting
step
for
PtdEtn
synthesis
through
the
decarboxylation
pathway
.

Therefore
,
the
regulation
of
PtdSer
synthesis
and
its
intracellular
transport
appear
to
be
essential
events
for
the
maintenance
of
normal
cellular
PtdSer
and
PtdEtn
levels
.

Here
we
describe
the
current
understanding
of
the
regulation
of
PtdSer
biosynthesis
and
the
transport
of
PtdSer
from
the
ER
to
the
mitochondria
in
mammalian
cells
.

Diclofenac
inhibits
proliferation
and
differentiation
of
neural
stem
cells
.

Nonsteroidal
anti
-
inflammatory
drugs
(
NSAIDs
)
are
widely
used
in
clinical
situations
as
anti
-
inflammatory
,
analgesic
and
antipyretic
drugs
.

However
,
it
is
still
unknown
whether
NSAIDs
have
effects
on
the
development
of
the
central
nervous
system
.

In
the
present
study
,
we
investigated
the
effects
of
NSAIDs
on
neural
stem
cell
(
NSC
)
proliferation
and
differentiation
into
neurons
.

In
contrast
to
aspirin
,
naproxen
,
indomethacin
and
ibuprofen
,
treatment
with
diclofenac
(
10
microM
)
for
2
days
induced
the
death
of
NSCs
in
a
concentration
-
dependent
manner
.

Diclofenac
also
inhibited
the
proliferation
of
NSCs
and
their
differentiation
into
neurons
.

Treatment
with
diclofenac
resulted
in
nuclear
condensation
(
a
morphological
change
due
to
apoptosis
of
NSCs
)
24hr
after
the
treatment
and
activated
caspase
-
3
after
6
hr
,
indicating
that
diclofenac
may
cause
apoptosis
of
neuronal
cells
via
activation
of
the
caspase
cascade
.

These
results
suggest
that
diclofenac
may
affect
the
development
of
the
central
nervous
system
.

Tissue
expression
and
translational
control
of
rat
kynurenine
aminotransferase
/
glutamine
transaminase
K
mRNAs
.

Kynurenic
acid
(
KA
)
is
an
endogenous
glutamate
receptor
antagonist
at
the
level
of
the
different
ionotropic
glutamate
receptors
.

One
of
the
enzymes
responsible
for
the
production
of
KA
,
kynurenine
aminotransferase
I
(
KATI
)
,
also
catalyses
the
reversible
transamination
of
glutamine
to
oxoglutaramic
acid
(
GTK
,
EC
2
.
6
.
1
.
15
)
.

The
enzyme
exists
in
a
cytosolic
and
in
a
mitochondrial
form
because
of
the
presence
of
two
different
KATI
mRNAs
coding
for
a
protein
respectively
with
and
without
leader
sequence
targeting
the
protein
into
mitochondria
.

We
have
cloned
from
a
phage
library
of
rat
kidney
cDNA
four
new
KATI
cDNAs
containing
different
5
'
untranslated
regions
(
UTRs
)
.

One
of
the
transcripts
(
+
14KATI
cDNA
)
contains
an
alternative
site
of
initiation
of
translation
.

The
tissue
distribution
of
the
different
transcripts
was
studied
by
RT
-
PCR
.

The
study
demonstrated
that
several
KATI
mRNAs
are
constitutively
expressed
in
ubiquitous
manner
,
while
+
14KATI
mRNA
is
present
only
in
kidney
.

The
translational
efficiency
of
the
different
transcripts
was
studied
in
vitro
and
enzymatic
activities

(

)
on
duodenal

(

significantly
increased

Because

and
because
reciprocal
CFTR

has
been
previously
shown

,
we
speculate
that
NHE3

increased

Selective

Topiramate
is
a
widely
used
antiepileptic
agent
whose
mechanism
of
action
is
poorly
understood
.

The
drug
has
been
reported
to
interact
with
various
ion

,
including
AMPA

.

In

rat

,
topiramate
at

)
selectively
inhibited
pharmacologically
isolated
excitatory
synaptic

.

Topiramate
also
partially
depressed

,
but
with
lower
efficacy
.

Topiramate
did
not
alter
the

in
paired

experiments
,
and
it
reduced
the
amplitude
of
miniature
EPSCs
without
affecting
their
frequency
,
demonstrating
that
the
block
of

occurs
postsynaptically
.

Inhibition
of
GluR5

could
represent
a
key
mechanism
underlying
the
anticonvulsant
activity
of
topiramate
.

Moreover
,
these

support
the
concept
that

represent
a
novel
target
for

development

Hypertension
is
a

diseases
such
as
stroke
,
myocardial

,
and
heart

,
the
leading
causes
of
death
in
the

world
.

Inhibitors
of
the
renin
-
angiotensin
system
(
RAS
)
have
proven
to
be
successful
treatments
for
hypertension
.

As
renin
specifically
catalyses
the
rate
-
limiting
step
of
the
RAS
,
it
represents
the
optimal
target
for
RAS
inhibition
.

Several
peptide
-
like
renin
inhibitors
have
been
synthesized
previously
,
but
poor
pharmacokinetic
properties
meant
that
these
compounds
were
not

useful
.

We
employed
a
combination
of
molecular
modelling
and
crystallographic
structure
analysis
to
design
renin
inhibitors
lacking
the
extended
peptide
-
like
backbone
of
earlier
inhibitors
,
for
improved
pharmacokinetic

.

This
led
to
the
discovery
of
aliskiren

of

The
serotonin
transporter
polymorphism
,
5HTTLPR
,
is
associated
with
a
faster
response
time
to
sertraline
in
an
elderly
population
with
major
depressive
disorder
.

RATIONALE
:
A
common
polymorphism
(
5HTTLPR
)
within
the
promoter
region
of
the
serotonin
transporter
gene
(
LSC6A4
)
has
been
shown
to
influence
response
time
as
well
as
overall
response
to
selective
serotonin
reuptake
inhibitors
(
SSRIs
)
in
subjects
with
major
depressive
disorder
.

We
hypothesized
that
a
similar
effect
in
response
time
to
sertraline
would
be
observed
and
that
no
effect
on
response
time
would
be
seen
in
a
placebo
arm
.

OBJECTIVES
:
We
tested
the
hypothesis
that
subjects
homozygous
for
the
long
allele
at
the
5HTTLPR
polymorphism
would
respond
more
rapidly
to
sertraline
than
subjects
carrying
one
or
two
copies
of
the
short
allele
.

METHODS
:
HAM
-
D
and
CGI
-
I
responses
to
sertraline
and
placebo
were
measured
weekly
in
the
context
of
an
8
-
week
,
placebo
-
controlled
study
in
elderly
depressed
subjects
.

Genotyping
of
the
5HTTLPR
polymorphism
was
performed
to
test
for
correlations
with
response
at
each
week
in
the
sertraline
and
placebo
groups
(
n
=
206
)
.

RESULTS
:
Subjects
homozygous
for
the
long
allele
of
5HTTLPR
showed
a
significant
increase
in
response
at
week
1
and
week
2
,
as
assessed
by
the
CGI
-
I
scale
compared
with
subjects
carrying
one
or
two
copies
of
the
short
allele
(
P
=
0
.
01
at
both
weeks
)
.

No
significant
difference
was
observed
in
the
placebo
group
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
These
results
suggest
that
genetic
variation
in
the
serotonin
transporter
gene
effects
the
response
time
to
sertraline
and
provides
complementing
evidence
to
previous
reports
that
this
polymorphism
affects
response
time
to
other
SSRIs
.

Changes
of
phosphorylation
of
cAMP
response
element
binding
protein
in
rat
nucleus

after
chronic

intake
:
naloxone
reversal
.

AIM
:
To
study
the
changes
in
the
expression
and
phosphorylation
of
cAMP
response
element
binding
protein
(
CREB
)
in
the
rat
nucleus
accumbens
after
chronic
ethanol
intake
and
its
withdrawal
.

METHODS
:
Ethanol
was
given
in
drinking
water
at
the
concentration
of
6
%
(
v
/
v
)
,
for
one
month
.

Changes
in
the
levels
of
CREB
and
phospho
-
CREB
(
p
-
CREB
)
protein
in
the
nucleus
accumbens
were
measured
by
immunohistochemistry
methods
.

RESULTS
:
Ethanol
given
to
rats
in
drinking
water
decreased
the
level
of
p
-
CREB
protein
in
the
nucleus
accumbens
(
-
75
%
)
at
the
time
of
exposure
to
ethanol
.

The
decrement
of
p
-
CREB
protein
in
the
nucleus
accumbens
remained
at
24
h
(
-
35
%
)
and
72
h
(
-
28
%
)
of
ethanol
withdrawal
,
which
recovered
toward
control
level
after
7
d
of
ethanol
withdrawal
.

However
,
chronic
ethanol
,
as
well
as
ethanol
withdrawal
failed
to
produce
any
significant
alteration
in
the
level
of
CREB
protein
in
the
nucleus
accumbens
.

Naloxone
(
alone
)
treatment
of
rats
had
no
effect
on
the
levels
of
CREB
and
p
-
CREB
protein
in
the
nucleus
accumbens
.

However
,
when
naloxone
was
administered
concurrently
with
ethanol
treatment
,
it
antagonized
the
down
-
regulation
of
p
-
CREB
protein
in
the
nucleus
accumbens
(
142
%
)
of
rats
exposed
to
ethanol
.

CONCLUSION
:
A
long
-
term
intake
of
ethanol
solution
down
-
regulates
the
phosphorylation
of
CREB
in
the
nucleus
accumbens
,
and
those
changes
can
be
reversed
by
naloxone
,
which
may
be
one
kind
of
the
molecular
mechanisms
associated
with
ethanol
dependence
.

Zuclopenthixol
facilitates
memory
retrieval
in
rats
:
possible
involvement
of
noradrenergic
and
serotonergic
mechanisms
.

Although
disturbed
memory
function
often
coexists
with
psychosis
,
the
cognitive
effects
of
antipsychotic
medications
with
diverse
pharmacodynamic
properties
are
rarely
investigated
.

The
neurocognitive
profile
of
zuclopenthixol
,
a
thioxanthene
dopaminergic
antagonist
and
a
conventional
neuroleptic
agent
,
has
yet
to
be
investigated
despite
the
effect
of
the
drug
on
a
variety
of
neurotransmitter
systems
involved
in
mediation
of
learning
and
memory
processes
.

In
this
study
,
the
effect
of
zuclopenthixol
was
tested
on
memory
retrieval
24
h
after
training
using
an
inhibitory
avoidance
task
in
rats
.

Acute
administration
of
zuclopenthixol
(
0
.
7
and
1
.
4
mg
/
kg
i
.
p
.
)
before
retrieval
testing
increased
step
-
through
latency
during
the
test
session
.

The
same
doses
of
zuclopenthixol
did
not
affect
the
ambulatory
activity
of
rats
in
the
openfield
test
and
therefore
the
facilitatory
effect
of
the
drug
on
memory
function
could
not
be
confounded
with
any
motoric
properties
.

This
study
also
investigated
the
effect
of
zuclopenthixol
on
cortical
and
hippocampal
monoaminergic
neurotransmitters
'
levels
together
with
acetylcholinesterase
enzyme
(
AChE
)
activity
,
both
of
which
are
known
to
be
important
in
control
of
cognitive
function
.

Administration
of
zuclopenthixol
(
0
.
7
and
1
.
4
mg
/
kg
i
.
p
.
)
neither
affected
dopamine
(
DA
)
level
nor
AChE
activity
in
rat
cortex
and
hippocampus
.

On
the
other
hand
,
the
lower
dose
of
zuclopenthixol
elevated
cortical
norepinephrine
(
NE
)
level
,
while
the
higher
dose
elevated
both
cortical
and
hippocampal
NE
level
together
with
hippocampal
serotonin
(
5
-
HT
)
level
.

These
results
may
suggest
the
involvement
of
adrenergic
and
serotonergic
mechanisms
in
the
facilitatory
effect
of
zuclopenthixol
on
retrieval
memory
.

Zuclopenthixol
may
therefore
be
a
better
alternative
than
other
commonly
used
antipsychotic
medications
reported
to
impair
cognitive
function
of
schizophrenic
patients
.

As

(

glutamic

(
4a
)
was
designed
as
a
structural
hybrid
between

.

4a
was
shown
to
be
a
potent

and
a
high

ligand
and
to
indiscriminately
bind
to
the

in
which
the

replaced
by

which
have
previously
been
incorporated

in
yeast
by
expressing
constitutively

greatly
increases
the

This
increased

These
results
provide
strong
support
of
the
hypothesis
that
the
cellular
target
of
these
drugs
is
DNA

and
that
these

kill

Failure
of
ritodrine
to
prevent
preterm
labor
in
the
sheep
.

OBJECTIVES
:
The
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
determine
whether
continuous
infusion
of
ritodrine
could
prevent
preterm
delivery
in
sheep
.

STUDY
DESIGN
:
Sheep
in
preterm
labor
induced
by
RU
486
(
mifepristone
)
received
infusions
of
either
ritodrine
(
n
=
5
)
or
saline
solution
(
n
=
5
)
,
and
the
progress
of
labor
was
monitored
.
beta

-
Adrenergic
receptor
density
and
function
(
agonist
-
induced
cyclic
adenosine
monophosphate
production
)
was
measured
in
myometrial
samples
from
both
groups
.

RESULTS
:
Ritodrine
initially
inhibited
labor
contractions
.

This
inhibition
was
only
maintained
for
16
hours
,
after
which
both
the
amplitude
and
frequency
of
electromyographic
bursts
and
contractions
returned
.

The
failure
of
the
myometrium
to
respond
to
ritodrine
(
desensitization
)
was
associated
with
significant
reductions
in
agonist
-
induced
cyclic
adenosine
monophosphate
production
and
beta
2
-
adrenergic
receptor
concentration
in
myometrial
tissue
collected
from
these
animals
compared
with
the
saline
solution
-
treated
controls
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
Continuous
infusion
of
ritodrine
to
sheep
in
preterm
labor
produces
only
a
transient
inhibition
of
contractions
.

This
desensitization
is
caused
by
a
down
-
regulation
of
myometrial
beta

-
adrenergic
receptors
.

Different
neuroleptics
show
common
dose
and
time
dependent
effects
in
quantitative
field
potential
analysis
in
freely
moving
rats
.

Under
the
assumption
that
field
potentials
recorded
from
particular
brain
areas
reflect
the
net
balance
of
neurotransmitter
activities
,
the
dose
-
and
time
-
dependent
responses
induced
by
intraperitoneal
application
of
different
neuroleptic
drugs
are
quantified
by
spectral
analysis
of
the
electroencephalogram
recorded
from
frontal
cortex
,
hippocampus
,
striatum
and
reticular
formation
.

The
actions
of
haloperidol
,
chlorpromazine
,
clozapine
,
prothipendyl
and
thioridazine
in
general
were
characterized
by
increases
of
the
spectral
power
in
the
alpha
1
and
beta
range
,
at
higher
dosages
also
in
the
theta
range
.

This
observed
pattern
of
changes
is
in
line
with
the
neuroleptic
induced
spectral
changes
reported
in
the
literature
for
other
animals
and
man
.

In
the
light
of
the
already
known
effects
of
other
psychoactive
drugs
on
the
frequency
content
of
field
potentials
in
the
rat
,
it
should
now
be
possible
to
classify
different
drugs
in
terms
of
their
clinical
indication
.

With
respect
to
the
type
of
neurotransmitter
control
underlying
the
changes
produced
by
various
neuroleptics
,
it
is
quite
obvious
from
the
comparisons
with
the
respective
drug
effects
that
dopamine
-
D1
-
receptor
controlled
transmission
is
not
responsible
for
this
action
.

On
the
basis
of
earlier
findings
a
possible
interaction
between
dopamine
-
D2
receptor
or
glutamatergic
transmitter
control
is
discussed
.

The
effects
of
labetalol
and
dilevalol
on
isolated
cardiovascular
preparations
of
the
guinea
-
pig
and
rat
.

Differing
effects
of
labetalol
and
dilevalol
on
cardiovascular
preparations
have
been
reported
.

I
have
studied
the
effects
of
labetalol
and
dilevalol
on
the
contractile
responses
of
the
rat
and
guinea
-
pig
left
atria
and
rat
portal
vein
.

On
the
guinea
-
pig
left
atria
low
concentrations
of
labetalol
(
>
or
=
10
(
-
8
)
M
)
and
of
dilevalol
(
>
or
=
10
(
-
7
)
M
)
inhibited
to
a
small
extent
the
responses
to
electrical
cardiac
stimulation
,
which
is
indicative
of
membrane
stabilizing
activity
.

Labetalol
(
>
or
=
3
x
10
(
-
8
)
M
)
and
dilevalol
(
>
or
=
10
(
-
8
)
M
)
caused
surmountable
antagonism
of
the
isoprenaline
responses
of
the
atria
and
the
pA2
values
were
8
.
60
and
8
.
98
at
the
beta
1
-
adrenoceptors
of
the
rat
left
atria
and
7
.
90
and
8
.
31
,
respectively
,
on
the
guinea
-
pig
left
atria
which
has
functional
beta
1
-
and
beta
2
-
adrenoceptors
.

Labetalol
and
dilevalol
(
both
at
>
or
=
10
(
-
7
)
M
)
attenuated
the
spontaneous
contractile
activity
of
the
rat
portal
vein
and
the
attenuation
to
labetalol
at
10
(
-
6
)
M
was
abolished
by
ICI
118
,
551
which
illustrates
that
the
labetalol
-
induced
attenuation
is
beta
2
-
adrenoceptor
mediated
.

The
isoprenaline
attenuation
responses
of
the
portal
vein
were
inhibited
by
labetalol
and
dilevalol
(
both
at
>
or
=
10
(
-
7
)
M
)
and
the
pA2
value
for
the
labetalol
at
beta
2
-
adrenoceptors
was
7
.
59
.

It
is
concluded
that
labetalol
and
dilevalol
are
beta
1
-
adrenoceptor
selective
antagonists
.

Prostacyclin
analogues
inhibit
tissue
factor
expression
in
the
human
monocytic
cell
line
THP
-
1
via
a
cyclic
AMP
-
dependent
mechanism
.

Increased
expression
of
tissue
factor
procoagulant
by
peripheral
blood
monocytes
has
been
implicated
in
a
number
of
thrombotic
disorders
.

The
present
studies
were
undertaken
to
determine
whether
stable
analogues
of
prostacyclin
,
a
potent
endothelium
-
derived
platelet
inhibitor
and
vasodilator
,
could
inhibit
tissue
factor
expression
by
human
monocytic
cells
.

Exposure
of
monocytic
tumor
THP
-
1
cells
to
100
ng
/
ml
endotoxin
,
2
units
/
ml
interleukin
-
1
beta
,
or
5
ng
/
ml
tumor
necrosis
factor
-
alpha
for
4
hours
led
to
increased
tissue
factor
procoagulant
activity
.

Preincubation
for
30
minutes
with
iloprost
,
ciprostene
,
and
carbacyclin
led
to
a
dose
-
dependent
inhibition
of
tissue
factor
expression
induced
by
all
three
challenging
agents
.

Iloprost
was
the
most
potent
:
50
%
inhibition
occurred
at
5
nM
,
a
concentration
close
to
the
reported
dissociation
constant
for
iloprost
binding
to
the
platelet
prostacyclin
receptor
.

An
orally
active
analogue
,
cicaprost
,
was
equally
effective
against
endotoxin
-
induced
tissue
factor
expression
.

Carbacyclin
and
ciprostene
were
100
times
less
potent
.

Iloprost
prevented
the
endotoxin
-
induced
expression
of
tissue
factor
antigen
on
the
surface
of
THP
-
1
cells
,
as
determined
by
flow
cytometry
.

Iloprost
(
500
pM
-
50
nM
)
increased
intracellular
levels
of
cyclic
AMP
.

This
effect
was
potentiated
by
isobutylmethylxanthine
,
an
inhibitor
of
phosphodiesterase
.

The
inhibitory
effects
of
iloprost
on
tissue
factor
expression
were
also
potentiated
by
isobutylmethylxanthine
and
mimicked
by
forskolin
and
dibutyryl
cyclic
AMP
but
not
dibutyryl
cyclic
GMP
.

These
results
suggest
that
prostacyclin
may
play
a
role
in
downregulating
tissue
factor
expression
in
monocytes
,
at
least
in
part
via
elevation
of
intracellular
levels
of
cyclic
AMP
.

Effectiveness
of
endopeptidase
inhibition
(
candoxatril
)
in
congestive
heart
failure
.

Candoxatril
is
a
novel
,
orally
active
inhibitor
of
neutral
endopeptidase
EC
3
.
4
.
24
.
11
,
the
enzyme
that
degrades
atrial
natriuretic
peptide
(
ANP
)
.

The
acute
and
chronic
(
10
days
treatment
)
hemodynamic
and
hormonal
effects
of
candoxatril
(
150
mg
twice
daily
)
in
12
patients
with
moderately
severe
congestive
heart
failure
were
investigated
in
a
randomized
,
placebo
-
controlled
,
double
-
blind
study
.

On
study
day
1
,
candoxatril
acutely
increased
plasma
ANP
levels
,
suppressed
aldosterone
and
decreased
right
atrial
and
pulmonary
capillary
wedge
pressures
.

After
10
days
of
treatment
,
basal
ANP
was
increased
and
basal
aldosterone
was
decreased
.

Body
weight
was
reduced
,
most
likely
reflecting
chronic
natriuretic
or
diuretic
effects
,
or
both
,
and
there
was
a
trend
toward
increased
cardiac
index
and
reduced
preload
values
.

On
study
day
10
,
the
acute
effects
of
candoxatril
were
similar
to
those
on
day
1
(
i
.
e
.
,
ANP
was
further
increased
,
aldosterone
was
suppressed
,
and
right
and
left
ventricular
filling
pressures
were
decreased
)
.

Thus
,
candoxatril
may
offer
a
new
and
effective
therapeutic
approach
in
the
treatment
of
heart
failure
.

Prohormone
convertase
-
1
will
process
prorelaxin
,
a
member
of
the
insulin
family
of
hormones
.

Relaxin
is
a
polypeptide
hormone
involved
in
remodeling
of
the
birth
canal
during
parturition
.

It
is
synthesized
as
a
preprohormone
precursor
,
which
undergoes
specific
processing
to
form
the
mature
two
-
chain
disulfide
-
linked
active
species
that
is
secreted
by
the
cell
.

A
major
part
of
this
processing
requires
endoproteolytic
cleavage
at
specific
pairs
of
basic
amino
acid
residues
,
an
event
necessary
for
the
maturation
of
a
variety
of
important
biologically
active
proteins
,
such
as
insulin
and
nerve
growth
factor
.

Human
type
2
preprorelaxin
was
coexpressed
in
human
kidney
293
cells
with
the
candidate
prohormone
convertase
-
processing
enzymes
mPC1
or
mPC2
,
both
cloned
from
the
mouse
pituitary
tumor
AtT
-
20
cell
line
,
or
with
the
yeast
kex2
alpha
-
mating
factor
-
converting
enzyme
from
Saccharomyces
cerevisiae
.

Prorelaxin
expressed
alone
in
293
cells
was
secreted
into
the
culture
medium
unprocessed
.

Transient
coexpression
with
mPC1
or
kex2
,
but
not
with
mPC2
,
resulted
in
the
secretion
of
a
low
mol
wt
species
with
an
electrophoretic
mobility
very
similar
,
if
not
identical
,
to
that
of
authentic
mature
relaxin
purified
from
human
placenta
.

This
species
was
precipitable
by
monoclonal
antibodies
specific
for
relaxin
and
had
a
retention
time
on
reverse
phase
HPLC
comparable
to
that
of
relaxin
.

Its
analysis
by
both
electrospray
and
fast
atom
bombardment
mass
spectrometry
generated
mass
data
that
were
consistent
only
with
mature
relaxin
.

The
basic
residues
required
for
mPC1
-
dependent
cleavage
of
prorelaxin
are
defined
by
site
-
directed
mutagenesis
.

The
tricyclic
antidepressant
clomipramine
increases
plasma
glucose
levels
of
mice
.

Effects
of
the
tricyclic
antidepressant
clomipramine
on
plasma
glucose
levels
in
mice
were
studied
.

Clomipramine
at
doses
ranging
5
-
20
mg
/
kg
elicited
significant
hyperglycemia
in
mice
.

Hyperglycemia
elicited
by
clomipramine
was
not
reduced
by
pretreatment
with
the
5
-
hydroxytryptamine
(
5
-
HT
)
depleter
p
-
chlorophenylalanine
.

The
5
-
HT
(
1
/
2
/
5
/
7
)
-
receptor
antagonist
methysergide
and
the
5
-
HT
(
2A
/
2B
/
2C
)
-
receptor
antagonist
LY
53857
enhanced
clomipramine
-
induced
hyperglycemia
,
while
the
5
-
HT
(
1A
/
1B
)
-
receptor
antagonist
(
-
)
-
propranolol
and
the
5
-
HT
(
3
/
4
)
-
receptor
antagonist
tropisetron
did
not
affect
it
.

The
5
-
HT
(
2B
/
2C
)
-
receptor
antagonist
SB
206553
facilitated
hyperglycemia
induced
by
clomipramine
,
although
the
5
-
HT
(
2A
)
-
receptor
antagonist
ketanserin
was
without
effect
.

Clomipramine
-
induced
hyperglycemia
was
reduced
by
prior
adrenalectomy
.

These
results
suggest
that
clomipramine
induces
hyperglycemia
in
mice
by
blocking
the
5
-
HT
(
2B
)
and
/
or
5
-
HT
(
2C
)
receptors
,
which
results
in
facilitation
of
adrenaline
release
.

Compared
pharmacological
characteristics
in
humans
of
racemic
cetirizine
and
levocetirizine
,
two
histamine
H1
-
receptor
antagonists
.

The
potent
histamine
H
(
1
)
-
receptor
antagonist
cetirizine
(
Zyrtec
)
is
a
racemic
mixture
of
levocetirizine
(
now
available
under
the
trademark
Xyzal
and
dextrocetirizine
.

In
this
Commentary
,
we
examine
some
biological
properties
of
cetirizine
and
levocetirizine
,
namely
enantioselectivity
in
pharmacological
activity
and
pharmacokinetic
properties
,
with
emphasis
on
the
possibility
of
racemization
,
the
compared
behavior
of
the
two
enantiomers
,
and
the
potential
for
interactions
with
other
drugs
.

Recent
data
demonstrate
that
the
antihistaminergic
activity
of
the
racemate
is
primarily
due
to
levocetirizine
.

Levocetirizine
is
rapidly
and
extensively
absorbed
,
poorly
metabolized
,
and
not
subject
to
racemization
.

Its
pharmacokinetic
characteristics
are
comparable
after
administration
alone
or
in
the
racemate
.

Its
apparent
volume
of
distribution
is
smaller
than
that
of
dextrocetirizine
(
0
.
41
L
kg
(
-
1
)
vs
.
0
.
60
L
kg
(
-
1
)
)
.

Moreover
,
the
non
-
renal
(
mostly
hepatic
)
clearance
of
levocetirizine
is
also
significantly
lower
than
that
of
dextrocetirizine
(

8
mL
min
(
-
1
)
vs
.
29
.
2
mL
min
(

)
)
.

Our
conclusion
is
that
levocetirizine
is
indeed
the
eutomer
of
cetirizine
.

The
evidence
reviewed
here
confirms
preclinical
findings
and
offers
a
rationale
for
the
chiral
switch
from
the
racemate
to
levocetirizine
.

P2Y
(

)
receptor
agonist
INS37217
enhances
functional
recovery
after
detachment
caused
by
subretinal
injection
in
normal
and
rds
mice
.

PURPOSE
:
To
evaluate
the
effects
of
INS37217
on
the
recovery
of
retinal
function
after
experimental
retinal
detachment
induced
by
subretinal
injection
.

METHODS
:
Subretinal
injections
of
1
micro
L
of
fluorescent
microbeads
,
saline
,
or
INS37217
(
1
-
200
micro
M
)
were
made
by
the
transvitreal
method
in
normal
(
C57BL
/

)
mice
and
in
mice
heterozygous
for
the
retinal
degeneration
slow
(
rds
)
gene
.

Control
,
mock
-
injected
animals
underwent
corneal
puncture
without
injection
.

Histologic
and
ERG
evaluations
were
made
at
0
to
1
and
8
hours
,
and
1
,
3
,
7
,
10
,
14
,
and
60
days
post
injection
(
PI
)
.

DNA
fragmentation
was
evaluated
by
terminal
deoxynucleotidyl
transferase
-
mediated
uridine
5
'
-
triphosphate
-
biotin
nick
end
labeling
(
TUNEL
)
.

RESULTS
:
A
single
subretinal
injection
of
saline
solution
containing
fluorescent
beads
caused
a
histologically
evident
retinal
detachment
and
distributed
the
microbeads
to
almost
all
the
subretinal
space
.

Spontaneous
reattachment
occurred
within
24
hours
after
injection
and
was
accompanied
by
evident
retinal
folding
that
appeared
largely
resolved
by
6
days
later
.

Relative
to
controls
,
injection
of
saline
resulted
in
approximately
40
%
recovery
of
dark
-
adapted
a
-
wave
amplitude
at
24
hours
PI
and
gradually
improved
to
approximately
90
%
of
controls
at
2
months
PI
.

Subretinal
injection
of
saline
containing
INS37217
(
10
micro
M
)
significantly
increased
rod
and
cone
ERG
of
normal
and
rds
(
+
/
-
)
mice
at
1
and
10
days
PI
,
when
compared
with
injection
of
saline
alone
.

Additionally
,
INS37217
reduced
the
number
of
TUNEL
-
positive
photoreceptors
and
the
enhanced
rate
of
reattachment
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
Enhancement
of
ERG
recovery
by
INS37217
is
likely
due
to
reduced
retinal
folding
and
cell
death
associated
with
detachment
.

These
results
support
the
use
of
INS37217
to
help
restore
function
after
therapies
that
involve
subretinal
administration
of
drugs
in
animal
models
of
retinal
diseases
.

Activation
of
alpha
2B
-
adrenoceptors
mediates
the
cardiovascular
effects
of
etomidate
.

BACKGROUND
:
The
intravenous
anesthetic
etomidate
exhibits
structural
similarities
to
specific
alpha2
-
adrenoceptor
agonists
of
the
type
such
as
dexmedetomidine
.

The
current
study
was
performed
to
elucidate
the
possible
interaction
of
etomidate
with
alpha2
-
adrenoceptors
in
mice
lacking
individual
alpha2
-
adrenoceptor
subtypes
(
alpha2
-
KO
)
.

METHODS
:
Sedative
and
cardiovascular
responses
to
etomidate
and
the
alpha2
-
agonist
,
dexmedetomidine
,
were
determined
in
mice
deficient
in
alpha2
-
receptor
subtypes
.

Inhibition
of
binding
of
the
alpha2
-
receptor
antagonist
[
3H
]
RX821002
to
recombinant
alpha2
-
receptors
by
etomidate
was
tested
in
human
embryonic
kidney
(
HEK293
)
cells
in
vitro
.

RESULTS
:
In
vivo
,
loss
and
recovery
of
the
righting
reflex
required
similar
times
after
intraperitoneal
injection
of
etomidate
in
wild
-
type
and
in
alpha2A
-
receptor
-
deficient
mice
,
indicating
that
the
hypnotic
effect
of
etomidate
in
mice
does
not
require
the
alpha2A
-
receptor
subtype
.

Intravenous
injection
of
etomidate
resulted
in
a
transient
increase
(
duration
2
.
4
+
/
-
0
.
2
min
)
in
arterial
blood
pressure
in
wild
-
type
mice
(
17
+
/
-
3
mmHg
)
.

Etomidate
did
not
affect
blood
pressure
in
alpha2B
-
KO
or
alpha2AB
-
KO
mice
.

In
membranes
from
HEK293
cells
transfected
with
alpha2
-
receptors
,
etomidate
inhibited
binding
of
the
alpha2
-
antagonist
,
[
3H
]
RX821002
,
with
higher
potency
from
alpha2B
-
and
alpha2C
-
receptors
than
from
alpha2A
-
receptors
(
Ki
alpha2A
208
microm
,
alpha2B
26
microm
,
alpha2C
56
microm
)
.

In
alpha2B
-
receptor
-
expressing
HEK293
cells
,
etomidate
rapidly
increased
phosphorylation
of
the
extracellular
signal
-
related
kinases
ERK1
/
2
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
These
results
indicate
that
etomidate
acts
as
an
agonist
at
alpha2
-
adrenoceptors
,
which
appears
in
vivo
primarily
as
an
alpha2B
-
receptor
-
mediated
increase
in
blood
pressure
.

This
effect
of
etomidate
may
contribute
to
the
cardiovascular
stability
of
patients
after
induction
of
anesthesia
with
etomidate
.

Transcriptional
control
of
the
arginine
/
lysine
transporter
,
cat
-
1
,
by
physiological
stress
.

Cells
respond
to
physiological
stress
by
phosphorylating
the
alpha
subunit
of
the
translation
initiation
factor
eIF2
.

This
adaptive
response
inhibits
protein
synthesis
and
up
-
regulates
genes
essential
for
cell
survival
.

Cat
-
1
,
the
transporter
for
the
essential
amino
acids
,
arginine
and
lysine
,
is
one
of
the
up
-
regulated
genes
.

We
previously
showed
that
stress
increases
cat
-
1
expression
by
coordinated
stabilization
of
the
mRNA
and
increased
mRNA
translation
.

This
induction
is
triggered
by
amino
acid
depletion
and
the
unfolded
protein
response
(
UPR
)
,
which
is
caused
by
unfolded
proteins
in
the
endoplasmic
reticulum
.

We
show
here
that
cat
-
1
gene
transcription
is
also
increased
by
cellular
stress
.

Our
studies
demonstrate
that
the
cat
-
1
gene
promoter
/
regulatory
region
is
TATA
-
less
and
is
located
in
a
region
that
includes
94
bases
of
the
first
exon
.

Transcription
from
this
promoter
is
stimulated
8
-
fold
by
cellular
stress
.

An
amino
acid
response
element
within
the
first
exon
is
shown
to
be
required
for
the
response
to
amino
acid
depletion
but
not
to
the
UPR
.

The
stimulation
of
transcription
by
amino
acid
depletion
requires
activation
of
GCN2
kinase
,
which
phosphorylates
eIF2alpha
.

This
phosphorylation
also
induces
translation
of
the
cat
-
1
mRNA
,
demonstrating
that
stress
-
induced
transcriptional
and
translational
control
of
cat
-
1
are
downstream
targets
of
a
signaling
pathway
initiating
with
eIF2alpha
phosphorylation
.

Our
studies
show
that
the
increase
in
cat
-
1
gene
expression
by
cellular
stress
involves
at
least
three
types
of
coordinate
regulation
:
regulation
of
transcription
,
regulation
of
mRNA
stability
,
and
regulation
of
mRNA
translation
.

Mechanism
of
organophosphates
(
nerve
gases
and
pesticides
)
and
antidotes
:
electron
transfer
and
oxidative
stress
.

Evidence
indicates
that
nerve
gas
toxins
operate
in
ways
in
addition
to
inhibition
of
acetylcholine
esterase
.

Alternative
bioactivities
are
discussed
with
focus
on
electron
transfer
.

The
main
class
,
including
pralidoxime
(
2
-
PAM
)
,
incorporates
conjugated
iminium
and
oxime
moieties
that
are
electron
affinic
.

Various
physiological
properties
of
iminium
and
oxime
species
are
reviewed
.

The
organophosphates
encompass
both
nerve
gases
and
insecticides
,
possessing
similar
properties
,
but
different
activities
.

Toxic
manifestations
are
apparently
due
,
in
part
,
to
oxidative
stress
.

Alkylation
of
DNA
takes
place
which
may
lead
to
generation
of
reactive
oxygen
species
.

Structure
-
activity
relationships
are
examined
,
including
reduction
potentials
and
the
captodative
effect
.

The
neuropharmacological
basis
for
the
use
of
memantine
in
the
treatment
of
Alzheimer
'
s
disease
.

Memantine
has
been
demonstrated
to
be
safe
and
effective
in
the
symptomatic
treatment
of
Alzheimer
'
s
disease
(
AD
)
.

While
the
neurobiological
basis
for
the
therapeutic
activity
of
memantine
is
not
fully
understood
,
the
drug
is
not
a
cholinesterase
inhibitor
and
,
therefore
,
acts
differently
from
current
AD
therapies
.

Memantine
can
interact
with
a
variety
of
ligand
-
gated
ion
channels
.

However
,
NMDA
receptors
appear
to
be
a
key
target
of
memantine
at
therapeutic
concentrations
.

Memantine
is
an
uncompetitive
(
channel
blocking
)
NMDA
receptor
antagonist
.

Like
other
NMDA
receptor
antagonists
,
memantine
at
high
concentrations
can
inhibit
mechanisms
of
synaptic
plasticity
that
are
believed
to
underlie
learning
and
memory
.

However
,
at
lower
,
clinically
relevant
concentrations
memantine
can
under
some
circumstances
promote
synaptic
plasticity
and
preserve
or
enhance
memory
in
animal
models
of
AD
.

In
addition
,
memantine
can
protect
against
the
excitotoxic
destruction
of
cholinergic
neurons
.

Blockade
of
NMDA
receptors
by
memantine
could
theoretically
confer
disease
-
modifying
activity
in
AD
by
inhibiting
the
"
weak
"
NMDA
receptor
-
dependent
excitotoxicity
that
has
been
hypothesized
to
play
a
role
in
the
progressive
neuronal
loss
that
underlies
the
evolving
dementia
.

Moreover
,
recent
in
vitro
studies
suggest
that
memantine
abrogates
beta
-
amyloid
(
Abeta
)
toxicity
and
possibly
inhibits
Abeta
production
.

Considerable
attention
has
focused
on
the
investigation
of
theories
to
explain
the
better
tolerability
of
memantine
over
other
NMDA
receptor
antagonists
,
particularly
those
that
act
by
a
similar
channel
blocking
mechanism
such
as
dissociative
anesthetic
-
like
agents
(
phencyclidine
,
ketamine
,
MK
-
801
)
.

A
variety
of
channel
-
level
factors
could
be
relevant
,
including
fast
channel
-
blocking
kinetics
and
strong
voltage
-
dependence
(
allowing
rapid
relief
of
block
during
synaptic
activity
)
,
as
well
as
reduced
trapping
(
permitting
egress
from
closed
channels
)
.

These
factors
may
allow
memantine
to
block
channel
activity
induced
by
low
,
tonic
levels
of
glutamate
-
-
an
action
that
might
contribute
to
symptomatic
improvement
and
could
theoretically
protect
against
weak
excitotoxicity
-
-
while
sparing
synaptic
responses
required
for
normal
behavioral
functioning
,
cognition
and
memory
.

Update
on
rivastigmine
.

BACKGROUND
:
Rivastigmine
is
a
carbamate
drug
designed
to
inhibit
both
acetylcholinesterase
and
butyrylcholinesterase
by
reversibly
covalently
bonding
to
these
enzymes
.

Butyrylcholinesterase
in
-
creases
as
Alzheimer
disease
progresses
,
so
its
inhibition
may
become
more
important
as
the
disease
worsens
.

Metabolism
of
rivastigmine
occurs
at
the
synapse
rather
than
at
the
liver
and
previous
studies
have
demonstrated
no
drug
-
drug
interactions
.

Rivastigmine
has
a
half
-
life
at
the
synapse
of
9
hours
allowing
for
bid
dosing
.

REVIEW
SUMMARY
:
Effective
therapy
requires
up
-
titration
from
initial
dosage
of
3
mg
/
d
to
6
mg
/
d
with
additional
increases
to
9
mg
or
12
mg
/
d
giving
additional
benefits
in
some
patients
.

Beneficial
effects
with
rivastigmine
therapy
in
the
functioning
of
activities
of
daily
living
,
behavior
,
cognition
,
and
global
functioning
have
been
demonstrated
in
patients
with
mild
to
moderate
Alzheimer
disease
in
4
large
double
-
blind
,
placebo
-
controlled
multicenter
clinical
trials
.

Potential
adverse
effects
of
nausea
,
vomiting
,
or
diarrhea
in
these
original
Alzheimer
trials
with
rapid
(
every
week
)
dosage
increases
occurred
in
up
to
34
%
of
patients
and
can
be
minimized
by
slower
monthly
up
-
titrations
.

Rivastigmine
also
was
proven
effective
in
decreasing
psychiatric
symptoms
and
cognitive
deficits
in
a
large
double
-
blind
,
placebo
-
controlled
trial
in
patients
with
diffuse
Lewy
body
disease
.

Other
studies
have
suggested
that
rivastigmine
improves
symptoms
in
nursing
home
patients
with
more
severe
stage
Alzheimer
disease
,
Parkinson
dementia
,
and
subcortical
dementia
.

Follow
-
up
studies
have
suggested
that
rivastigmine
may
delay
disease
progression
and
,
in
patients
discontinuing
the
drug
,
no
withdrawal
effects
were
seen
.

CONCLUSION
:
Rivastigmine
is
an
effective
therapeutic
agent
for
treating
cognitive
and
behavioral
symptoms
in
Alzheimer
disease
and
diffuse
Lewy
body
disease
and
may
also
have
beneficial
effects
in
vascular
and
Parkinson
dementias
.

Based

determined
that
(

,
80
to
85
%
of
cefadroxil

These
findings
demonstrate
that
PEPT2
is
the
primary
transporter
responsible
for
cefadroxil
uptake
in
the
choroid

.

Moreover
,
the
data
suggest
a
role
for
PEPT2
in
the

OBJECTIVE
:
To
determine
in

the
extent
of

that
there
are
direct

METHODS
:
Synovial

.

RESULTS
:
Levels
of
cartilage
degradation
products
in
early
RA
or
early
PsA
were
not
elevated
above
levels
in
OA
,
although
in
early
inflammatory

,
TNFalpha
and
MMP
-
1
levels
were
similar
to
those
observed
in
late
inflammatory
disease
and
higher
than
those
in

.

PIICP
was
reduced
in

.

Correlations
were
observed

and
the

was
reduced
in

to
SM
macrophage
infiltration
in

and
in
the

.

Both

correlated
with
CD4

and
lining

in
the
SM
,
and
MMP

levels
correlated
with
lining

levels
,
but
TNFalpha
and
IL

10
levels
did
not
.

CONCLUSION
:
Except
for
CII
synthesis
,
there
were
no
significant
changes
in
extracellular
matrix
turnover
of
aggrecan
or
CII
in
the
early
stages
of
human
inflammatory
arthritis
.

However
,
the
direct
correlation
between
the
increases
in
TNFalpha
and
MMP
-
1
production
and
collagen
degradation
suggests
that
collagenase
cleavage
of
cartilage
collagen
is
related
to
the
activities
of
TNFalpha
and
MMP
-
1
.

The
reduction
in
CII
synthesis
in
early
RA
may
contribute
to
the
developing
pathology
,
since
a
lack
of
synthesis
of
this
molecule
would
inhibit
maintenance
of
cartilage
matrix
.

Molecular
mechanism
of
terbinafine
resistance
in
Saccharomyces
cerevisiae
.

Ten
mutants
of
the
yeast
Saccharomyces
cerevisiae
resistant
to
the
antimycotic
terbinafine
were
isolated
after
chemical
or
UV
mutagenesis
.

Molecular
analysis
of
these
mutants
revealed
single
base
pair
exchanges
in
the
ERG1
gene
coding
for
squalene
epoxidase
,
the
target
of
terbinafine
.

The
mutants
did
not
show
cross
-
resistance
to
any
of
the
substrates
of
various
pleiotropic
drug
resistance
efflux
pumps
tested
.

The
ERG1
mRNA
levels
in
the
mutants
did
not
differ
from
those
in
the
wild
-
type
parent
strains
.

Terbinafine
resistance
was
transmitted
with
the
mutated
alleles
in
gene
replacement
experiments
,
proving
that
single
amino
acid
substitutions
in
the
Erg1
protein
were
sufficient
to
confer
the
resistance
phenotype
.

The
amino
acid
changes
caused
by
the
point
mutations
were
clustered
in
two
regions
of
the
Erg1
protein
.

Seven
mutants
carried
the
amino
acid
substitutions
F402L
(
one
mutant
)
,
F420L
(
one
mutant
)
,
and
P430S
(
five
mutants
)
in
the
C
-
terminal
part
of
the
protein
;
and
three
mutants
carried
an
L251F
exchange
in
the
central
part
of
the
protein
.

Interestingly
,
all
exchanges
identified
involved
amino
acids
which
are
conserved
in
the
squalene
epoxidases
of
yeasts
and
mammals
.

Two
mutations
that
were
generated
by
PCR
mutagenesis
of
the
ERG1
gene
and
that
conferred
terbinafine
resistance
mapped
in
the
same
regions
of
the
Erg1
protein
,
with
one
resulting
in
an
L251F
exchange
and
the
other
resulting
in
an
F433S
exchange
.

The
results
strongly
indicate
that
these
regions
are
responsible
for
the
interaction
of
yeast
squalene
epoxidase
with
terbinafine
.

The
inhibitory
effect
of
ginseng
saponins
on
the
stress

induced

interleukin

6
level
in
mice
.

The
effect
of
ginseng
saponins
on
plasma
interleukin
-
6
(
IL
-
6
)
in
non
-
stressed
and
immobilization
-
stressed
mice
were
investigated
.

Ginseng
total
saponins
,
ginsenosides
Rb2
,
Rg1
and
Rd
administered
intraperitoneally
attenuated
the
immobilization
stress
-
induced
increase
in
plasma
IL
-
6
level
.

But
,
intracerebroventricular
injection
of
each
ginsenoside
did
not
affect
plasma
IL
-
6
level
induced
by
immobilization
stress
.

Ginsenosides
Rb2
,
Rd
and
Rg1
significantly
decreased
norepinephrine
and
/
or
epinephrine
-
induced
increase
of
IL
-
6
level
in
macrophage
cell
line
(
RAW
264
.
7
)
.

Thus
,
it
can
be
suggested
that
the
inhibitory
action
of
ginseng
saponins
against
the
immobilization
stress
-
induced
increase
of
plasma
IL
-
6
level
would
be
in
periphery
;
at
least
in
part
,
mediated
by
blocking
norepinephrine
-
and
/
or
epinephrine
-
induced
increase
of
IL
-
6
level
in
macrophage
rather
than
in
the
brain
.

Ginseng
saponins
might
be
proposed
as
a
possible
candidate
in
the
research
or
therapeutic
modulation
of

disorders
.

Enhanced

adrenergic
receptor
(
beta2AR
)
signaling
by
adeno

associated
viral
(
AAV
)
-
mediated
gene
transfer
.

BACKGROUND
:
Beta2
-
adrenergic
receptors
(
beta2AR
)
play
important
regulatory
roles
in
a
variety
of
cells
and
organ
systems
and
are
important
therapeutic
targets
in
the
treatment
of
airway
and
cardiovascular
disease
.

Prolonged
use
of
beta
-
agonists
results
in
tolerance
secondary
to
receptor
down
-
regulation
resulting
in
reduced
therapeutic
efficiency
.

The
purpose
of
this
work
is
to
evaluate
the
signaling
capabilities
of
the
beta2AR
expressed
by
a
recombinant
adeno
-
associated
viral
(
AAV
)
vector
that
also
included
an
enhanced
green
fluorescent
protein
(
EGFP
)
gene
(
AAV
-
beta2AR
/
EGFP
)
.

RESULTS
:
By
epifluorescence
microscopy
,
approximately
40
%
of
infected
HEK
293
cells
demonstrated
EGFP
expression
.

beta2AR
density
measured
with
[
3H
]
dihydroalprenolol
(
[

DHA
)
increased
either
13
-
or
77
-
fold
in
infected
cells
compared
to
mock
infected
controls
depending
on
the
culture
conditions
used
.

The
[
3H
]
DHA
binding
was
to
a
single
receptor
population
with
a
dissociation
constant
of
0
.
42
nM
,
as
would
be
expected
for
wild
-
type
beta2AR
.

Agonist
competition
assays
with
[
3H
]
DHA
showed
the
following
rank
order
of
potency
:
isoproterenol
>
epinephrine
>
norepinephrine
,
consistent
with
beta2AR
interaction
.

Isoproterenol
-
stimulated
cyclic
AMP
levels
were
5
-
fold
higher
in
infected
cells
compared
to
controls
(

.

Receptor
trafficking
demonstrated
surface
expression
of
beta2AR
with

treatment
and
internalization
following
isoproterenol
treatment
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
We
conclude
that
HEK
293
cells
infected
with
AAV
-
beta2AR
/
EGFP
effectively
express
beta2AR
and
that
increased
expression
of
these
receptors
results
in
enhanced
beta2AR
signaling
.

This
method
of
gene
transfer
may
provide
an
important
means
to
enhance
function
in
in

Structure
of
human
microsomal
cytochrome
P450

.

Evidence
for
a
peripheral
fatty
acid
binding
site
.

A
2
.
7
-
Angstrom
molecular
structure
of
human
microsomal
cytochrome
P450
2C8
(
CYP2C8
)
was
determined
by
x
-
ray
crystallography
.

The
membrane
protein
was
modified
for
crystallization
by
replacement
of
the
hydrophobic
N
-
terminal
transmembrane
domain
with
a
short
hydrophilic
sequence
before
residue
28
.

The
structure
of
the
native
sequence
is
complete
from
residue
28
to
the
beginning
of
a
C
-
terminal
histidine
tag
used
for
purification
.

CYP2C8
is
one
of
the
principal
hepatic
drug
-
metabolizing
enzymes
that
oxidizes
therapeutic
drugs
such
as
taxol
and
cerivastatin
and
endobiotics
such
as
retinoic
acid
and
arachidonic
acid
.

Consistent
with
the
relatively
large
size
of
its
preferred
substrates
,
the
active
site
volume
is
twice
that
observed
for
the
structure
of
CYP2C5
.

The
extended
active
site
cavity
is
bounded
by
the
beta1
sheet
and
helix
F
'
that
have
not
previously
been
implicated
in
substrate
recognition
by
mammalian
P450s
.

CYP2C8
crystallized
as
a
symmetric
dimer
formed
by
the
interaction
of
helices
F
,
F
'
,
G
'
,
and
G
.

Two
molecules
of
palmitic
acid
are
bound
in
the
dimer
interface
.

The
dimer
is
observed
in
solution
,
and
mass
spectrometry
confirmed
the
association
of
palmitic
acid
with
the
enzyme
.

This
novel
finding
identifies
a
peripheral
binding
site
in
P450s
that
may
contribute
to
drug
-
drug
interactions
in
P450
metabolism
.

Efficacy
and
safety
of
tamsulosin
in
the
treatment
of
urological
diseases
.

The
alpha
(
1
)
-
adrenoceptor
antagonist
,
tamsulosin
,
is
selective
for
alpha
(
1A
)
-
and
alpha
(
1D
)
-
over
alpha
(
1B
)
-
adrenoceptors
.

Both
placebo
-
controlled
and
comparative
studies
with
other
agents
have
demonstrated
tamsulosin
to
be
an
effective
treatment
for
patients
with
lower
urinary
symptoms
suggestive
of
benign
prostatic
hyperplasia
.

Its
effectiveness
appears
to
be
maintained
over
many
years
.

Tamsulosin
may
also
effectively
reduce
lower
urinary
tract
symptoms
in
other
urological
diseases
.

A
dose
of
tamsulosin
0
.
4
mg
/
day
has
a
tolerability
close
to
that
of
placebo
and
has
little
,
if
any
,
blood
pressure
lowering
effects
.

Tolerability
and
lack
of
blood
pressure
lowering
are
maintained
even
in
high
-
risk
patients
such
as
those
with
cardiovascular
comorbidity
and
/
or
comedication
.

Apart
from
adrenoceptor
subtype
-
selectivity
,
a
smooth
pharmacokinetic
profile
of
its
modified
-
release
formulation
and
a
selective
accumulation
in
target
tissues
may
contribute
to
an
excellent
efficacy

.

OBJECTIVE
:
To
examine
the
influence
of
carvedilol
dose
and
concentration
in
serum
on
plasma
brain
natriuretic

(
BNP
)
,
a

.

METHODS
:
12
patients
with

were
enrolled
in

.

They
received
carvedilol
at
daily
doses
of
1
-
20
mg
with
a
1

2
weekly
adjustment
.

Serum
carvedilol
trough
concentrations
were
measured
in
steady
-
state
using
a
specific
fluorescence
HPLC
method
.

The
degree
of
improvement
in
heart
failure
was
assessed
from
the
ratio
of
change
in
the
plasma
BNP
concentration
,
2
weeks
,
1
month
and
3
months
after
the
commencement
of
carvedilol
administration
.

RESULTS
:
From
the
pharmacokinetic
aspect
,
there
was
no
valid
correlation
between
the
trough
serum
carvedilol
concentration
(
Cmin
)
and
daily
dose
per

weight
(
Dd

BW
)
,
indicating
that
there
was
a
wide
difference
in
the
carvedilol
elimination
capacity
among
individuals
.

A
significant
decrease
in
the
BNP
was
observed
at
the
3rd
month
in
patients
treated
with
the
high
dose
(
>
750
mg
/
3
months
)
.

On
the

of
less
than

,
the
degree
of

was
significantly
larger
,
relative
to
the

CONCLUSIONS
:
The
total
carvedilol
dose
was
confirmed
to
be
one
of
the
determinants
for
improvement
in
heart
failure
,
and
it
was
suggested
that
the
initial
serum
level
also
plays
an
important
role
in
therapeutic
outcome
.

Therefore
,
it
may
be
important
to
monitor
the
serum
carvedilol
level
at
the
introductory
period
to
determine
the
daily
dose
requirements
because
of
the
wide
inter
-
individual
variability
in
its
metabolic
clearance
.

Structural
model
of
carnitine
palmitoyltransferase
I
based
on
the
carnitine
acetyltransferase
crystal
.

CPT
I
(
carnitine
palmitoyltransferase
I
)
catalyses
the
conversion
of
palmitoyl
-
CoA
into
palmitoylcarnitine
in
the
presence
of
L
-
carnitine
,
facilitating
the
entry
of
fatty
acids
into
mitochondria
.

We
propose
a
3
-
D
(
three
-
dimensional
)
structural
model
for
L
-
CPT
I
(
liver
CPT
I
)
,
based
on
the
similarity
of
this
enzyme
to
the
recently
crystallized
mouse
carnitine
acetyltransferase
.

The
model
includes
607
of
the
773
amino
acids
of
L
-
CPT
I
,
and
the
positions
of
carnitine
,
CoA
and
the
palmitoyl
group
were
assigned
by
superposition
and
docking
analysis
.

Functional
analysis
of
this
3
-
D
model
included
the
mutagenesis
of
several
amino
acids
in
order
to
identify
putative
catalytic
residues
.

Mutants
D477A
,
D567A
and
E590D
showed
reduced
L
-
CPT
I
activity
.

In
addition
,
individual
mutation
of
amino
acids
forming
the
conserved
Ser685
-
Thr686
-
Ser687
motif
abolished
enzyme
activity
in
mutants
T686A
and
S687A
and
altered
K
(
m
)
and
the
catalytic
efficiency
for
carnitine
in
mutant
S685A
.

We
conclude
that
the
catalytic
residues
are
His473
and
Asp477
,
while
Ser687
probably
stabilizes
the
transition
state
.

Several
conserved
lysines
,
i
.
e
.
Lys455
,
Lys505
,
Lys560
and
Lys561
,
were
also
mutated
.

Only
mutants
K455A
and
K560A
showed
decreases
in
activity
of
50
%
.

The
model
rationalizes
the
finding
of
nine
natural
mutations
in
patients
with
hereditary
L
-
CPT
I
deficiencies
.

Thymidine
kinase
and
thymidine
phosphorylase
level
as
the
main
predictive
parameter
for
sensitivity
to
TAS
-
102
in
a
mouse
model
.

TAS
-
102
is
a
new
oral
anti
-
cancer
drug
preparation
,
composed
of
a
1
:
0
.
5
mixture
(
on
a
molar
basis
)
of
alpha
,
alpha
,
alpha

trifluorothymidine
(
FTD
)
and

-
chloro

-
[

methyl
]
-
2
,
4
(
1H
,
3H
)
-
pyrimidinedione
hydrochloride
(
TPI
)
.

TAS
-
102
currently
undergoing
clinical
trials
,
has
been
demonstrated
to
have
at
least
two
mechanisms
,
inhibition
of
TS
and
incorporation
into
DNA
.

We
hypothesized
that
the
thymidine
metabolism
enzyme
may
be
a
crucial
factor
that
affects
the
antitumor
activity
of
TAS
-
102
.

In
the
present
study
,
we
measured
the
enzyme
activity
of
thymidine
kinase
(
TK
)
,
thymidine
phosphorylase
(
TP
)
and
thymidilate
synthase
(
TS
)
in
human
cancer
xenografts
to
investigate
the
contribution
of
these
enzymes
to
the
sensitivity
of
TAS
-
102
.

Antitumor
activity
of
TAS
-
102
appears
to
be
associated
with
TK
,
tumor
growth
and
TS
.

However
,
the
most
related
factors
in
this
study
were
the
TK
and
TP
ratio
.

There
was
a
significant
correlation
(
p
=
0
.
04
)
between
tumor
growth
inhibition
and
this
ratio
.

These
results
suggested
that
the
activation
and
degradation
pattern
of
FTD
plays
an
important
role
in
the
efficacy
of
TAS
-
102
and
that
it
is
possible
to
use
the
TK
/
TP
ratio
to
predict
response
to
TAS
-
102
therapy
.

We
also
studied
the
influence
of
TPI
on
the
capacity
of
exogenous
dThd
to
reverse
FTD
-
dependent
growth
inhibition
.

Thymidine
(
dThd
)
levels
rescued
the
effect
of
FTD
in
vitro
and
significantly
increased
in
serum
after
administration
of
TAS
-
102
or
TPI
alone
but
not
FTD
alone
.

This
may
suggest
the
possibility
of
a
decrease
in
antitumor
effect
.

However
,
our
study
indicated
that
the
therapeutic
index
was
clearly
increased
by
FTD
combined
with
TPI
,
compared
with
FTD
alone
,
suggesting
FTD
-
induced
toxicity
to
sensitive
host
tissue
can
be
selectively
reversed
with
dThd
.

In
conclusion
,
TK
and
TPI
effects
on
TP
play
important
roles
in
the
cytotoxic
action
of
TAS
-
102
,
and
it
is
possible
to
use
the
TK
/
TP
ratio
to
predict
more
precisely
individual
resistance
or
sensitivity
.

Sepracor
in
the
US
is
developing
arformoterol
[
R
,
R

formoterol
]
,
a
single
isomer
form
of
the
beta
(
2
)
-
adrenoceptor
agonist
formoterol
[
eformoterol
]
.

This
isomer
contains
two
chiral
centres
and
is
being
developed
as
an
inhaled
preparation
for
the
treatment
of
respiratory
disorders
.

Sepracor
believes
that
arformoterol
has
the
potential
to
be
a
once
-
daily
therapy
with
a
rapid
onset
of
action
and
a
duration
of
effect
exceeding
12
hours
.

In
1995
,
Sepracor
acquired
New
England
Pharmaceuticals
,
a
manufacturer
of
metered
-
dose
and
dry
powder
inhalers
,
for
the
purpose
of
preparing
formulations
of
levosalbutamol
and
arformoterol
.

Phase
II
dose
-
ranging
clinical
studies
of
arformoterol
as
a
longer
-
acting
,
complementary
bronchodilator
were
completed
successfully
in
the
fourth
quarter
of
2000
.

Phase
III
trials
of
arformoterol
began
in
September
2001
.

The
indications
for
the
drug
appeared
to
be
asthma
and
chronic
obstructive
pulmonary
disease
(
COPD
)
.

However
,
an
update
of
the
pharmaceutical
product
information
on
the
Sepracor
website
in
September
2003
listed
COPD
maintenance
therapy
as
the
only
indication
for
arformoterol
.

In
October
2002
,
Sepracor
stated
that
two
pivotal
phase
III
studies
were
ongoing
in
1600
patients
.

Sepracor
estimates
that
its
NDA
submission
for
arformoterol
,
which
is
projected
for
the
first
half
of
2004
,
will
include
approximately
3000
adult
subjects
.

Sepracor
stated
in
July
2003
that
it
had
completed
more
than
100
preclinical
studies
and
initiated
or
completed
15
clinical
studies
for
arformoterol
inhalation
solution
for
the
treatment
of
bronchospasm
in
patients
with
COPD
.

In
addition
,
Sepracor
stated
that
the
two
pivotal
phase
III
studies
in
1600
patients
were
still
progressing
.

In
1995
,
European
patents
were
granted
to
Sepracor
for
the
use
of
arformoterol
in
the
treatment
of
asthma
,
and
the
US
patent
application
was
pending

Truncated
ErbB2
receptor
(
p95ErbB2
)
is
regulated
by
heregulin
through
heterodimer
formation
with
ErbB3
yet
remains
sensitive
to
the
dual
EGFR
/
ErbB2
kinase
inhibitor
GW572016
.

The
expression
of
the
NH2
terminally
truncated
ErbB2
receptor
(
p95ErbB2
)
in
breast
cancer
correlates
with
metastatic
disease
progression
compared
with
the
expression
of
full
-
length
p185ErbB2
.

We
now
show
that
heregulin
(
HRG
)
,
but
not
EGF
,
stimulates
p95ErbB2
phosphorylation
in
BT474
breast
cancer
cells
.

Furthermore
,
phospho
-
p95ErbB2
forms
heterodimers
with
ErbB3
,
but
not
EGFR
,
while
p185ErbB2
heterodimerizes
with
both
EGFR
and
ErbB3
.

The
predilection
of
p95ErbB2
to
heterodimerize
with
ErbB3
provides
an
explanation
for
its
regulation
by
HRG
,
an
ErbB3
ligand
.

GW572016
,
a
reversible
small
molecule
inhibitor
of
EGFR
and
ErbB2
tyrosine
kinases
,
inhibits
baseline
p95ErbB2
phosphorylation
in
BT474
cells
and
tumor
xenografts
.

Inhibition
of
p95ErbB2
,
p185ErbB2
,
and
EGFR
phosphorylation
by
GW572016
resulted
in
the
inhibition
of
downstream
phospho
-
Erk1
/
2
,
phospho
-
AKT
,
and
cyclin
D
steady
-
state
protein
levels
.

Increased
phosphorylation
of
p95ErbB2
and
AKT
in
response
to
HRG
was
abrogated
to
varying
degrees
by
GW572016
.

In
contrast
,
trastuzumab
did
not
inhibit
p95ErbB2
phosphorylation
or
the
expression
of
downstream
phospho
-
Erk1
/
2
,
phospho
-
AKT
,
or
cyclin
D
.

It
is
tempting
to
speculate
that
trastuzumab
resistance
may
be
mediated
in
part
by
the
selection
of
p95ErbB2
-
expressing
breast
cancer
cells
capable
of
exerting
potent
growth
and
prosurvival
signals
through
p95ErbB2
-
ErbB3
heterodimers
.

Thus
,
p95ErbB2
represents
a
target
for
therapeutic
intervention
,
and
one
that
is
sensitive
to
GW572016
therapy
.

Alpha1
-
adrenergic
receptors
and
their
inhibitors
in
lower
urinary
tract
symptoms
and
benign
prostatic
hyperplasia
.

PURPOSE
:
We
provide
a
comprehensive
overview
of
the
role
of
alpha1
-
adrenergic
receptors
(
alpha1ARs
)
as
critical
mediators
of
lower
urinary
tract
symptoms
(
LUTS
)
and
pathophysiology
in
benign
prostatic
hyperplasia
(
BPH
)
,
and
we
review
the
pharmacological
antagonists
of
alpha1ARs
.

MATERIALS
AND
METHODS
:
A
review
was
performed
of
pertinent
studies
in
the
literature
relating
to
the
pathophysiology
of
LUTS
and
BPH
,
focusing
on
the
role
of
alpha1ARs
,
and
of
clinical
trial
and
practice
data
evaluating
the
different
agents
that
inhibit
these
receptors
.

RESULTS
:
Further
characterization
of
the
alpha1AR
gene
family
indicates
that
3
receptor
subtypes
exist
in
humans
.

Their
different
distribution
between
urinary
tract
and
cardiovascular
tissues
has
provided
a
strategy
for
the
development
of
improved
therapeutic
agents
.

Since
excessive
activity
of
the
alpha1aAR
and
alpha1dAR
subtypes
appears
to
be
a
common
feature
in
symptomatic
BPH
and
alpha1aARs
are
enriched
in
prostatic
tissue
,
drugs
that
demonstrate
high
alpha1aAR
selectivity
have
attracted
attention
.

Tamsulosin
,
which
has
high
affinity
for
alpha1aAR
and
alpha1dAR
subtypes
but
not
for
alpha1bAR
,
shows
efficacy
similar
to
the
nonsubtype
selective
agents
terazosin
and
doxazosin
.

It
is
associated
with
fewer
cardiovascular
side
effects
,
although
it
has
some
ejaculatory
side
effects
.

The
nonsubtype
selective
agent
alfuzosin
also
demonstrates
efficacy
and
offers
an
enhanced
side
effect
profile
,
particularly
minimizing
hypotension
.

Other
agents
with
super
selective
specificity
for
the
alpha1aAR
subtype
are
under
investigation
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
Further
advances
in
the
treatment
of
LUTS
associated
with
BPH
may
depend
not
only
on
receptor
subtype
selectivity
,
but
also
on
other
pharmacokinetic
and
pharmacodynamic
factors
.

Ornithine
metabolism
in
male
and
female
rat
kidney
:
mitochondrial
expression
of
ornithine
aminotransferase
and
arginase
II
.

In
the
kidney
,
L
-
ornithine
is
reabsorbed
along
the
proximal
convoluted
tubule
(
PCT
)
,
transported
by
basolateral
carriers
,
and
produced
by
arginase
II
(
AII
)
.

Here
,
the
renal
metabolic
fate
of
L
-
ornithine
was
analyzed
in
male
and
female
rats
.

Kidneys
and
renal
zones
were
dissected
and
used
for
Western
blot
analysis
,
immunofluorescence
,
and
electron
microscopic
studies
.

Ornithine
aminotransferase
(
OAT
)
and
AII
were
localized
using
specific
antibodies
.

Ornithine
oxidation
was
determined
by
incubating
microdissected
tubules
with
L
-
[
1
-
14C
]
or
L
-
[
U
-
14C
]
ornithine
in
the
presence
or
absence
of
energy
-
providing
substrates
.

Ornithine
decarboxylase
(
ODC
)
mRNAs
were
localized
by
in
situ
hybridization
.

The
48
-
kDa
OAT
protein
was
detected
in
male
and
female
kidneys
,
but
its
level
was
fourfold
higher
in
the
latter
.

OAT
relative
distribution
increased
from
the
superficial
cortex
toward
the
outer
medulla
to
reach
its
highest
level
.

Almost
all
OAT
protein
was
localized
in
cortical
and
medullary
proximal
straight
tubules
(
CPST
and
OSPST
,
respectively
)
.

In
proximal
straight
tubule
(
PST
)
,
AII
protein
distribution
overlapped
that
of
OAT
.

No
gender
difference
in
AII
protein
level
was
found
.

OAT
and

ornithine
decarboxylation
occurred
in
all
tubules
,
but
predominantly
in
proximal

.

L

[
1

ornithine
decarboxylation
was
enhanced
when
L
-
[
1
-
14C
]
ornithine
was
given
to
tubules
as
the
sole
substrate
.

The
use
of
L

[
U
-
14C
]
ornithine
demonstrated
the
complete
oxidation
of
ornithine
.

In
conclusion
,
the
OAT
gene
was
expressed
more
in
female
rat
proximal
tubules
than
in
male
.

Because
OAT
and
AII
proteins
overlapped
in
PST
mitochondria
,
L
-
arginine
-
derived
ornithine
may
be
preferentially
converted
to
L

glutamate
,
as
proven
by
ornithine
oxidation
.

However
,
the
coexpression
of
ODC
,
glutamate
decarboxylase
,
and
glutamine
synthetase
in
PST
suggests
that
L
-
ornithine
can
also
be
metabolized
to
putrescine
,
GABA
,
and
L
-
glutamine
.

The
fate
of
L

ornithine
may
depend
on
the
cellular
context
.

Emerging
role
of
epidermal
growth
factor
receptor
inhibition
in
therapy
for
advanced
malignancy
:
focus
on
NSCLC
.

Combination
chemotherapy
regimens
have
emerged
as
the
standard
approach
in
advanced
non
-
small
-
cell
lung
cancer
.

Meta
-
analyses
have
demonstrated
a
2
-
month
increase
in
median
survival
after
platinum
-
based
therapy
vs
.
best
supportive
care
,
and
an
absolute
10
%
improvement
in
the
1
-
year
survival
rate
.

Just
as
importantly
,
cytotoxic
therapy
has
produced
benefits
in
symptom
control
and
quality
of
life
.

Newer
agents
,
including
the
taxanes
,
vinorelbine
,
gemcitabine
,
and
irinotecan
,
have
expanded
our
therapeutic
options
in
the
treatment
of
advanced
non
-
small
-
cell
lung
cancer
.

Despite
their
contributions
,
we
have
reached
a
therapeutic
plateau
,
with
response
rates
seldom
exceeding
30
-
40
%
in
cooperative
group
studies
and
1
-
year
survival
rates
stable
between
30
%
and
40
%
.

It
is
doubtful
that
substituting
one
agent
for
another
in
various
combinations
will
lead
to
any
further
improvement
in
these
rates
.

The
thrust
of
current
research
has
focused
on
targeted
therapy
,
and
epidermal
growth
factor
receptor
inhibition
is
one
of
the
most
promising
clinical
strategies
.

Epidermal
growth
factor
receptor
inhibitors
currently
under
investigation
include
the
small
molecules
gefitinib
(
Iressa
,
ZD1839
)
and
erlotinib
(
Tarceva
,
OSI
-
774
)
,
as
well
as
monoclonal
antibodies
such
as
cetuximab
(
IMC
-
225
,
Erbitux
)
.

Agents
that
have
only
begun
to
undergo
clinical
evaluation
include
CI
-
1033
,
an
irreversible
pan
-
erbB
tyrosine
kinase
inhibitor
,
and
PKI166
and
GW572016
,
both
examples
of
dual
kinase
inhibitors
(
inhibiting
epidermal
growth
factor
receptor
and
Her2
)
.

Preclinical
models
have
demonstrated
synergy
for
all
these
agents
in
combination
with
either
chemotherapy
or
radiotherapy
,
leading
to
great
enthusiasm
regarding
their
ultimate
contribution
to
lung
cancer
therapy
.

However
,
serious
clinical
challenges
persist
.

These
include
the
identification
of
the
optimal
dose
(
s
)
;
the
proper
integration
of
these
agents
into
popular
,
established
cytotoxic
regimens
;
and
the
selection
of
the
optimal
setting
(
s
)
in
which
to
test
these
compounds
.

Both
gefitinib
and
erlotinib
have
shown
clinical
activity
in
pretreated
,
advanced
non
-
small
-
cell
lung
cancer
,
but
placebo
-
controlled
randomized
Phase
III
studies
evaluating
gefitinib
in
combination
with
standard
cytotoxic
therapy
,
to
our
chagrin
,
have
failed
to
demonstrate
a
survival
advantage
compared
with
chemotherapy
alone
.

Externalization
of
phosphatidylserine
during
apoptosis
does
not
specifically
require
either
isoform
of
phosphatidylserine
synthase
.

Phosphatidylserine
(
PtdSer
)
is
made
in
mammalian
cells
by
two
PtdSer
synthases
,
PSS1
and
PSS2
.

In
the
plasma
membrane
PtdSer
is
normally
localized
on
the
inner
leaflet
but
undergoes
transbilayer
movement
during
apoptosis
and
becomes
exposed
on
the
cell
surface
.

We
induced
apoptosis
with
staurosporine
in
four
Chinese
hamster
ovary
(
CHO
)
cell
lines
that
are
deficient
in
PSS1
and
/
or
PSS2
to
determine
if
PtdSer
generated
by
either
of
these
enzymes
is
required
for
externalization
on
the
cell
surface
during
apoptosis
.

The
onset
of
apoptosis
was
confirmed
by
the
appearance
of
morphological
changes
and
DNA
fragmentation
while
the
plasma
membrane
remained
largely
intact
.

In
all
cell
lines
,
regardless
of
their
content
of
PSS1
and
/
or
PSS2
,
apoptosis
occurred
to
approximately
the
same
extent
,
and
within
approximately
the
same
time
frame
,
as
in
parental
CHO
-
K1
cells
.

The
exposure
of
PtdSer
on
the
cell
surface
was
assessed
by
annexin
V
labeling
and
flow
cytometry
.

Cells
that
were
deficient
in
either
PSS1
or
PSS2
,
as
well
as
cells
that
were
deficient
in
both
PSS1
and
PSS2
,
externalized
normal
amounts
of
PtdSer
.

Our
study
demonstrates
,
that
reduction
of
in
vitro
serine
-
exchange
activity
,
even
by
97
%
,
does
not
restrict
the
externalization
of
PtdSer
during
apoptosis
.

Moreover
,
a
normal
level
of
expression
of
PSS1
and
/
or
PSS2
is
not
required
for
generating
the
pool
of
PtdSer
externalized
during
apoptosis
.

Block

5
sodium

by
novel
alpha

hydroxyphenylamide
analogues
of
phenytoin
.

Voltage
-
gated
sodium
(
Na
)
channels
are
a
critical
component
of
electrically
excitable
cells
.

Phenytoin
(
diphenylhydantoin
,
DPH
)
is
an
established
sodium
channel
blocker
and
is
a
useful
anticonvulsant
and
class
1b
antiarrhythmic
,
and
has
been
effectively
used
in
the
treatment
of
neuropathic
pain
.

In
this
study
,
we
have
synthesized
novel
alpha
-
hydroxyphenylamide
analogues
of
diphenylhydantoin
and
examined
their
ability
to
inhibit
human
Na

.
5
sodium
channels
expressed
in
Chinese
Hamster
Ovary
(

cells
.

Phenyl
ring
substitutions
were
examined
including
para
-
methyl
,
para
-
fluoro
,
para
-
chloro
,
ortho
-
chloro
and
meta
-
chloro
.

We
have
found
that
phenyl
ring
substitutions
with
electron
withdrawing
properties
resulted
in
compounds
with
greater
activity
.

In
comparison
to
diphenylhydantoin
,
the
novel
chloro
-
substituted
alpha
-
hydroxyphenylamide
compounds
produced
as
much
as
a
20

fold
greater
tonic
and
frequency

blockade
of
Na
(

)
1

5
channels
with
an
IC
(

value
of
14
.
5
microM
.

In
addition
,
the
chloro
-
substitutions
have
position
specific
state
dependent
blocking
properties
.

The
ortho

,
meta
-
and
para
-
chloro
substitutions
have
an
8
-
,
13
-
and
3
-
fold
increased
affinity
for
the
inactivated
state
,
respectively
.

Molecular
modeling
suggests
that
these
differences
in
affinity
are
due
to
a
direct
interaction
with
the
receptor
.

Comparing
models
of
diphenylhydantoin
to
the
novel
alpha
-
hydroxyphenlyamide
compound
suggests
that
the
increased
activity
may
be
due
to
an
optimized
phenyl
ring
position
and
increased
molecular
volume
.

This
information
may
be
useful
in
the
development
of
more
potent
sodium
channel
blockers

Effects
of
an
ethanolic
salix
extract
on
the

of
selected

mediators
in

.

Salix
extracts
are
in
current
use
for
the
treatment
of
pain
and
inflammation
.

In

an
insight
into
the
mechanism
(
s
)
of
action
of
the
ethanolic
Salix
extract
1520L
-
-
which
is
essentially
similar
to
an

for
which
clinical

have
demonstrated
analgesic
effectiveness
-
-
its
effects
were
evaluated
in
an

system
using

.

The

obtained
for
the

for
the
Salix

1520L
and

L745337
,
respectively
.

There
was
no
effect
on
COX

.

The
Salix

inhibited
the
LPS

respectively
.

Both
,
salicin
and

,
had
no
effect
in
any
of
the
parameters
.

Our
results
indicate
that
Salix
extract
1520L
inhibits
COX

2
-
mediated
PGE2
release
through
compounds
other
than
salicin

Our
data
further
suggest
that
the

is
a
weak

Kinetic
mechanism
of
quinone
oxidoreductase
2
and
its
inhibition
by
the
antimalarial
quinolines
.

Quinone
oxidoreductase
2
(
QR2
)
purified
from
human
red
blood
cells
was
recently
shown
to
be
a
potential
target
of
the
quinoline
antimalarial
compounds
[
Graves
et
al
.
,
(

)
Mol

]
.

QR2
catalyzes
the
two
-
electron
reduction
of
menadione
via
the
oxidation
of
N
-
alkylated
or
N
-
ribosylated
nicotinamides
.

To
investigate
the
mechanism
and
consequences
of
inhibition
of
QR2
by
the
quinolines
further
,
we
have
used
steady
-
state
and
transient
-
state
kinetics
to
define
the
mechanism
of
QR2
.

Importantly
,
we
have
shown
that
QR2
when
isolated
from
an
overproducing
strain
of
E
.
coli
is
kinetically
equivalent
to
the
enzyme
from
the
native
human
red
blood
cell
source
.

We
observe
ping
-
pong
kinetics
consistent
with
one
substrate
/
inhibitor
binding
site
that
shows
selectivity
for
the
oxidation
state
of
the
FAD
cofactor
,
suggesting
that
selective
inhibition
of
the
liver
versus
red
blood
cell
forms
of
malaria
may
be
possible
.

The
reductant
N
-
methyldihydronicotinamide
and
the
inhibitor
primaquine
bind
exclusively
to
the
oxidized
enzyme
.

In
contrast
,
the
inhibitors
quinacrine
and
chloroquine
bind
exclusively
to
the
reduced
enzyme
.

The
quinone
substrate
menadione
,
on
the
other
hand
,
binds
nonspecifically
to
both
forms
of
the
enzyme
.

Single
-
turnover
kinetics
of
the
reductive
half
-
reaction
are
chemically
and
kinetically
competent
and
confirm
the
inhibitor
selectivity
seen
in
the
steady
-
state
experiments
.

Our
studies
shed
light
on
the
possible
in
vivo
potency
of
the
quinolines
and
provide
a
foundation
for
future
studies
aimed
at
creating
more
potent
QR2
inhibitors
and
at
understanding
the
physiological
significance
of
QR2
.

Evidence
that
the
granulocyte
colony
-
stimulating
factor
(
G
-
CSF
)
receptor
plays
a
role
in
the
pharmacokinetics
of
G
-
CSF
and
PegG
-
CSF
using
a
G
-
CSF
-
R
KO
model
.

The
covalent
attachment
of
polyethylene
glycol
to
filgrastim
results
in
a
new
molecule
pegfilgrastim
,
which
has
a
significantly
longer
half
-
life
than
filgrastim
.

It
is
likely
that
the
clearance
of
both
filgrastim
and
pegfilgrastim
involves
granulocyte
colony
simulating
factor
(
G
-
CSF
)
receptor
binding
,
but
the
pharmacokinetics
of
these
drugs
have
not
been
compared
in
mice
with
and
without
a
functional
G
-
CSF
receptor
.

We
sought
to
clarify
the
role
of
receptor
-
mediated
clearance
of
filgrastim
and
pegfilgrastim
using
wild
-
type
(
WT
)
mice
or
mice
with
a
non
-
functional
G
-
CSF
-
R
(
knockout
,
KO
)
.

We
administered
single
doses
of
filgrastim
or
pegfilgrastim
(
10
or
100
microg
kg
(
-
1
)
)
intravenously
to
WT
and
KO
mice
.

Plasma
levels
of
protein
were
measured
by
enzyme
-
linked
immunosorbent
assay
(
ELISA
)
at
preset
time
points
,
and
AUC
,
MRT
,
CL
,
V
(
d
)
,
and
T
(
1
/
2
)
were
calculated
.

When
compared
with
WT
mice
,
the
G
-
CSF
-
R
KO
mice
had
significantly
greater
AUC
,
longer
MRT
,
longer
T
(
1
/
2
)
,
and
lower
clearance
.

This
was
the
case
whether
animals
received
10
or
100
microg
kg
(
-
1
)
and
whether
they
received
filgrastim
or
pegfilgrastim
.

The
volume
of
protein
distribution
was
identical
among
WT
and
KO
mice
.

However
,
the
V
(
d
)
was
larger
after
pegfilgrastim
dosing
than
after
filgrastim
dosing
.

In
both
WT
and
KO
mice
,
increasing
the
dose
of
figrastim
or
pegfilgrastim
resulted
in
a
proportional
increase
in
the
AUC
.

A
functional
G
-
CSF
-
R
is
an
important
mechanism
in
the
plasma
clearance
of
both
filgrastim
and
pegfilgrastim
.

Cross
-
inhibition
of
SR
-
BI
-
and
ABCA1
-
mediated
cholesterol
transport
by
the
small
molecules
BLT
-
4
and
glyburide
.

Scavenger
receptor
class
B
type
I
(
SR
-
BI
)
and
ABCA1
are
structurally
dissimilar
cell
surface
proteins
that
play
key
roles
in
HDL
metabolism
.

SR
-
BI
is
a
receptor
that
binds
HDL
with
high
affinity
and
mediates
both
the
selective
lipid
uptake
of
cholesteryl
esters
from
lipid
-
rich
HDL
to
cells
and
the
efflux
of
unesterified
cholesterol
from
cells
to
HDL
.

ABCA1
mediates
the
efflux
of
unesterified
cholesterol
and
phospholipids
from
cells
to
lipid
-
poor
apolipoprotein
A
-
I
(
apoA
-
I
)
.

The
activities
of
ABCA1
and
other
ATP
binding
cassette
superfamily
members
are
inhibited
by
the
drug
glyburide
,
and
SR
-
BI
-
mediated
lipid
transport
is
blocked
by
small
molecule
inhibitors
called
BLTs
.

Here
,
we
show
that
one
BLT
,
[
1
-
(
2
-
methoxy
-
phenyl
)
-
3
-
naphthalen
-
2
-
yl
-
urea
]
(
BLT
-
4
)
,
blocked
ABCA1
-
mediated
cholesterol
efflux
to
lipid
-
poor
apoA
-
I
at
a
potency
similar
to
that
for
its
inhibition
of
SR
-
BI
(
IC
(
50
)
approximately
55
-
60
microM
)
.

Reciprocally
,
glyburide
blocked
SR
-
BI
-
mediated
selective
lipid
uptake
and
efflux
at
a
potency
similar
to
that
for
its
inhibition
of
ABCA1
(
IC
(
50
)
approximately
275
-
300
microM
)
.

As
is
the
case
with
BLTs
,
glyburide
increased
the
apparent
affinity
of
HDL
binding
to
SR
-
BI
.

The
reciprocal
inhibition
of
SR
-
BI
and
ABCA1
by
BLT
-
4
and
glyburide
raises
the
possibility
that
these
proteins
may
share
similar
or
common
steps
in
their
mechanisms
of
lipid
transport
.

Carbonic
anhydrase
inhibitors
:
aromatic
and
heterocyclic
sulfonamides
incorporating
adamantyl
moieties
with
strong
anticonvulsant
activity
.

A
series
of
aromatic
/
heterocyclic
sulfonamides
incorporating
adamantyl
moieties
were
prepared
by
reaction
of
aromatic
/
heterocyclic
aminosulfonamides
with
the
acyl
chlorides
derived
from
adamantyl
-
1
-
carboxylic
acid
and
1

acetic
acid
.

Related
derivatives
were
obtained
from
the
above
-
mentioned
aminosulfonamides
with
adamantyl
isocyanate
and
adamantyl
isothiocyanate
,
respectively
.

Some
of
these
derivatives
showed
good
inhibitory
potency
against
two
human
CA
isozymes
involved
in
important
physiological
processes
,
CA
I
,
and
CA
II
,
of
the
same
order
of
magnitude
as
the
clinically
used
drugs
acetazolamide
and
methazolamide
.

The
lipophilicity
of
the
best
CA
inhibitors
was
determined
and

were
investigated
for
their

showed

On

,
flavonoids

These

important
for

In
determining
the
biological
profiles
of

antiprogestins
,
it
is
important
to
assess
the
hormonal
and
antihormonal
activity
,
selectivity
,
and
potency
of
their
proximal
metabolites
.

The
early
metabolism
of
mifepristone
is
characterized
by
rapid
demethylation
and
hydroxylation
.

Similar
initial
metabolic
pathways
have
been
proposed
for
CDB
-
2914
(
CDB
:
Contraceptive
Development
Branch
of
NICHD
)
and
CDB

4124
,
and
their
putative

have
been
synthesized
.

We
have
examined
the
functional
activities
and
potencies
,
in
various

,
and
relative

(

)
for

of

The
binding
affinities
of
the
monodemethylated
metabolites
for
rabbit

and

and

were
similar
to
those
of
the
parent
compounds
.

Monodemethylated
mifepristone
bound
to

with
higher
affinity
than
monodemethylated
CDB

Antiglucocorticoid

was
determined
by

.

The
mono

and
didemethylated
metabolites
of
CDB

2914
and
CDB
-
4124
had
less
antiglucocorticoid
activity
(
IC
(

)
'

approximately
10
(

)
than
monodemethylated

(
IC
(

)
or
the
other
test
compounds
.

At

)
M
in
transcription
assays
,
none
of
these
compounds
showed
progestin
agonist
activity
,
whereas
mifepristone
and
its
monodemethylated
metabolite
manifested
slight
glucocorticoid
agonist
activity
.

The
reduced
antiglucocorticoid
activity
of
monodemethylated
CDB
-
2914
and
CDB
-
4124
was
confirmed
in
vivo
by
the
thymus
involution
assay
in
adrenalectomized
male
rats
.

The
aromatic
A
-
ring
derivatives
-
stimulated

of
an
estrogen
-
responsive
reporter
plasmid
in
MCF
-

and
T47D
-
CO
human
breast
cancer
cells
but
were
much
less
potent
than
estradiol
.

Taken
together
,
these
data
suggest
that
the
proximal
metabolites
of
mifepristone
,
CDB
-
2914
,
and
CDB
-
4124
contribute
significantly
to
the
antiprogestational
activity
of
the
parent
compounds
in
vivo
.

Furthermore
,
the
reduced
antiglucocorticoid
activity
of
CDB
-
2914
and
CDB
-
4124
compared
to
mifepristone
in
vivo
may
be
due
in
part
to
decreased
activity
of
their
putative
proximal
metabolites
.

A
PET
study
of
dopamine
D2
and
serotonin
5
-
HT2
receptor
occupancy
in
patients
with
schizophrenia
treated
with
therapeutic
doses
of
ziprasidone
.

OBJECTIVE
:
Ziprasidone
is
an
atypical
antipsychotic
drug
that
shows
a
higher
affinity
for
serotonin
5
-
HT
(
2
)
receptors
compared
with
dopamine
D
(
2
)
receptors
in
vitro
.

The
affinity
of
ziprasidone
for
these
receptors
in
vivo
in
patients
was
examined
in
a
positron
emission
tomography
(
PET
)
study
.

METHOD
:
The
authors
conducted
a
PET
study
to
evaluate
D
(
2
)
occupancy
(
using
[
(
11
)
C
]
raclopride
)
and
5
-
HT
(
2
)
occupancy
(
using
[
(
18
)
F
]
setoperone
)
in
brain
regions
of
interest
in
16
patients
with
schizophrenia
or
schizoaffective
disorder
randomly
assigned
to
receive
40
,
80
,
120
,
or
160
mg
/
day
of
ziprasidone
,
which
reflected
the
recommended
dose
range
.

PET
scanning
was
done
after
3
weeks
of
administration
and
at
trough
plasma
levels
,
i
.
e
.
,
12
-
16
hours
after
the
last
dose
.

RESULTS
:
The
mean
5
-
HT
(
2
)
receptor
occupancy
was
significantly
higher
than
the
mean
D
(
2
)
receptor
occupancy
(
mean
=
76
%
,
SD
=
15
%
,
and
mean
=
56
%
,
SD
=
18
%
,
respectively
)
.

The
estimated
plasma
ziprasidone
concentration
associated
with
50
%
maximal
5
-
HT
(
2
)
receptor
occupancy
was
almost
four
times
lower
than
that
for
D
(
2
)
receptor
occupancy
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
These
data
affirm
that
ziprasidone
is
similar
to
other
novel
antipsychotics
in
having
greater
5
-
HT
(
2
)
than
D
(
2
)
receptor
occupancy
at
therapeutic
doses
and
suggest
that
the
optimal
effective
dose
of
ziprasidone
is
closer
to
120
mg
/
day
than
to
the
lower
doses
suggested
by
previous
PET
studies
.

The
relatively
high
D
(
2
)
receptor
occupancy
,
even
at
trough
plasma
levels
,
suggests
that
ziprasidone
is
more
similar
to
risperidone
and
olanzapine
in
receptor
occupancy
profile
than
to
clozapine
and
quetiapine
.

Since
ziprasidone
plasma
levels
show
significant
(
more
than
twofold
)
variation
within
a
single
dose
cycle
,
studies
that
are
aimed
at
peak
plasma
levels
(
6
hours
after
the
last
dose
)
and
that
examine
extrastriatal
regions
are
required
to
fully
characterize
the
in
vivo
occupancy
profile
of
ziprasidone
.

Characterization
of
the
interaction
of
ingenol
3
-
angelate
with
protein
kinase
C
.

Ingenol
3
-
angelate
(
I3A
)
is
one
of
the
active
ingredients
in
Euphorbia
peplus
,
which
has
been
used
in
traditional
medicine
.

Here
,
we
report
the
initial
characterization
of
I3A
as
a
protein
kinase
C
(
PKC
)
ligand
.

I3A
bound
to
PKC
-
alpha
in
the
presence
of
phosphatidylserine
with
high
affinity
;
however
,
under
these
assay
conditions
,
little
PKC
isoform
selectivity
was
observed
.

PKC
isoforms
did
show
different
sensitivity
and
selectivity
for
down
-
regulation
by
I3A
and
phorbol
12
-
myristate
13
-
acetate
(
PMA
)
in
WEHI
-
231
,
HOP
-
92
,
and
Colo
-
205
cells
.

In
all
of
the
three
cell
types
,
I3A
inhibited
cell
proliferation
with
somewhat
lower
potency
than
did
PMA
.

In
intact
CHO
-
K1
cells
,
I3A
was
able
to
translocate
different
green
fluorescent
protein
-
tagged
PKC
isoforms
,
visualized
by
confocal
microscopy
,
with
equal
or
higher
potency
than
PMA
.

PKC
-
delta
in
particular
showed
a
different
pattern
of
translocation
in
response
to
I3A
and
PMA
.

I3A
induced
a
higher
level
of
secretion
of
the
inflammatory
cytokine
interleukin
6
compared
with
PMA
in
the
WEHI
-
231
cells
and
displayed
a
marked
biphasic
dose
-
response
curve
for
the
induction
.

I3A
was
unable
to
cause
the
same
extent
of
association
of
the
C1b
domain
of
PKC
-
delta
with
lipids
,
compared
with
PMA
or
the
physiological
regulator
diacylglycerol
,
and
was
able
to
partially
block
the
association
induced
by
these
agents
,
measured
by
surface
plasmon
resonance
.

The
in
vitro
kinase
activity
of
PKC
-
alpha
induced
by
I3A
was
lower
than
that
induced
by
PMA
.

The
novel
pattern
of
behavior
of
I3A
makes
it
of
great
interest
for
further
evaluation
.

Enzyme
expression
profiles
suggest
the
novel
tumor
-
activated
fluoropyrimidine
carbamate
capecitabine
(
Xeloda
)
might
be
effective
against
papillary
thyroid
cancers
of
children
and
young
adults
.

PURPOSE
:
The
fluoropyrimidine
carbamate
(
capecitabine
)
is
converted
to
5
-
fluorouracil
(
5
-
FU
)
by
thymidine
phosphorylase
(
TP
)
inside
target
tissues
.

5
-
FU
interferes
with
DNA
synthesis
by
blocking
thymidylate
synthase
(
TS
)
but
is
inactivated
by
dihydropyrimidine
dehydrogenase
(
DPD
)
.

Favorable
enzyme
profiles
(
high
TP
and
low
DPD
)
generate
high
intratumor
levels
of
5
-
FU
that
are
effective
against
many
tumors
,
especially
those
with
low
TS
.

Capecitabine
has
not
been
tested
against
thyroid
cancers
,
and
it
is
not
known
to
what
extent
thyroid
cancers
express
TP
,
TS
or
DPD
.

METHODS
:
To
test
this
,
we
determined
TP
,
TS
and
DPD
in
19
thyroid
cancers
from
young
patients
(
14
papillary
,
4
follicular
,
1
medullary
)
by
immunohistochemistry
.

After
approval
by
the
Human
Use
Committee
,
the
intensity
of
TP
,
TS
,
and
DPD
staining
was
determined
by
two
independent
examiners
and
graded
(
absent
=
0
to
intense
=
3
)
with
>
90
%
concordance
.

RESULTS
:
TS
was
detected
in
7
/
19
cancers
(
37
%
)
,
TP
in
14
/
19
cancers
(
74
%
)
and
DPD
in
14
/
19
cancers
(
74
%
)
.

In
six
tumors
,
TP
was
more
intense
that
DPD
,
suggesting
capecitabine
sensitivity
.

Only
five
tumors
failed
to
express
TP
but
four
of
these
expressed
DPD
,
suggesting
capecitabine
resistance
.

Overall
,
6
/
19
tumors
(
32
%
of
the
total
)
had
a
favorable
expression
profile
,
and
all
of
them
were
papillary
cancers
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
We
conclude
that
the
majority
of
differentiated
thyroid
cancers
(
74
%
)
express
TP
and
low
levels
of
TS
(
63
%
undetectable
)
.

The
results
support
the
hypothesis
that
capecitabine
is
activated
in
the
majority
of
differentiated
thyroid
cancers
and
that
32
%
have
favorable
expression
of
all
three
enzymes
(
TP
,
TS
,
and
DPD
)
.

Polyamine

are
detailed
with
reference
to
the

of
oligoamine

of
polyamines
.

Enc

cuniculi
,
an
intracellular
parasite
of

,
has
both
biosynthetic
and
catabolic
enzymes
of
polyamine
metabolism
,
as
demonstrated
in
cell

free
extracts
of
mature
spores
.

The
uptake
of
polyamines
was
measured
in
immature
,
pre
-
emergent
spores
isolated
from
host
cells
by
Percoll
gradient
.

Spermine
was
rapidly
taken
up
and
metabolized
to

and

,
by

/
spermine
N
(

)
-
acetyltransferase
(
SSAT
)
and
polyamine

(

)
.

Most
of
the
spermidine
and
the
unknown
product
were
found
in
the
cell
incubation
medium
,
indicating
they
were
released
from

.

bis
(

oligoamine

of

,
such
as

,
as

as
arylamine
analogues
[

,
a

]
blocked
uptake
and
interconversion
of
spermine
at
micromolar
levels
and
,
in
the
case
of
BW
-
1
,
acted
as
substrate
for
PAO
.

The
Enc
.
cuniculi
PAO
activity
differed
from
that
found
in
mammalian
cells
with
respect
to
pH
optimum
,
substrate
specificity
and
sensitivity
to
known
PAO
inhibitors
.

SL
-
11158
inhibited
SSAT
activity
with
a
mixed
type
of
inhibition
in
which
the
analogue
had
a
70
-
fold
higher
affinity
for
the
enzyme
than
the
natural
substrate
,
spermine
.

The
interest
in
Enc
.
cuniculi
polyamine
metabolism
and
the
biochemical
effects
of
these
polyamine
analogues
is
warranted
since
they
cure
model
infections
of
Enc

cuniculi
in
mice
and
are
potential
candidates
for
human
clinical
trials
.

Redesign
of

.

In
eukaryotes
,
L

is
involved
in
energy
metabolism
by
facilitating
beta

oxidation
of
fatty

.

Carnitine

)
catalyze
the

.

To
redesign
the

of

,
we
mutated

.

The
M564G
mutated

showed
higher

was
1250

higher
than
that
of
the

,
and
lower

showed
modification
in
favor
of

CoAs
as

.

In
the
reverse
case
,
mutation
of
the
orthologous
glycine
(
Gly553
)
to
methionine
in
carnitine
octanoyltransferase
(
COT
)
decreased
activity
toward
its
natural
substrates
,
medium
-
and
long
-
chain
acyl
-
CoAs
,
and
increased
activity
toward
short

chain
acyl

CoAs
.

Another
CrAT
mutant
,
M564A
,
was
prepared
and
tested
in
the
same
way
,
with
similar
results
.

We
conclude
that
Met564
blocks
the
entry
of
medium
-
and
long
-
chain
acyl
-
CoAs
to
the
catalytic
site
of
CrAT
.

Three
-
dimensional
models
of
wild
-
type
and
mutated
CrAT
and
COT
support
this
hypothesis
.

We
show
for
the
first
time
that
a
single
amino
acid
is
able
to
determine
the
substrate
specificity
of
CrAT
and
COT
.

No
influence
of
moderate
hepatic
impairment
on
the
pharmacokinetics
of
lumiracoxib
,
an
oral
COX
-

selective
inhibitor
.

The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
evaluate
the
influence
of
hepatic
impairment
on
the
pharmacokinetics
(
PK
)
of
the
novel
cyclooxygenase
-
2
(
COX
-

)
selective
inhibitor
lumiracoxib
(
Prexige
)
,
so
that
dose
recommendations
for
clinical
use
can
be
provided
.

This
was
an
open

label
,
single

,
case
-
controlled
study
in
which
eight
subjects
with
liver
cirrhosis
classed
as
moderate
hepatic
impairment
(
Child
-
Pugh
score
:
7
-
9
)
and
eight
demographically
-
matched
healthy
subjects
received
a
single
oral
400
mg
dose
of
lumiracoxib
.

Routine
safety
assessments
were
made
and
blood
samples
were
taken
for
determination
of
lumiracoxib
concentrations
for
96
h
post
dose
.

The
ex
vivo
binding
of
lumiracoxib
to
plasma
proteins
was
determined
pre
dose
and
at
2
and
12
h
post
dose
.

An
analysis
of
variance
was
used
to
detect
differences
in
PK
parameters
(
AUC
,
Cmax
and
Tmax
)
between
the
treatment
groups
.

There
were
no
significant
differences
between
subjects
with
moderate
hepatic
insufficiency
and
healthy
subjects
in
the
area
under
the
lumiracoxib
plasma
concentration

(

)
)

.

The
rate
of
absorption
of
lumiracoxib
was
not
significantly
altered
by
hepatic
impairment
based
on
Cmax
and
Tmax
.

The
protein
-
bound
fraction
of
lumiracoxib
exceeded
98
%
both
in
healthy
control
subjects
and
in
those
with
moderate
hepatic
insufficiency
.

A
single
dose
of
400
mg
lumiracoxib
was
well
tolerated
.

In
conclusion
,
no
dose
adjustments
appear
to
be
required
when
lumiracoxib
is
administered
to
patients
with
either
mild
or
moderate
hepatic
impairment
.

P2Y12
,
a
new
platelet
ADP
receptor
,
target
of
clopidogrel
.

Clopidogrel
is
a
potent
antithrombotic
drug
that
inhibits
ADP
-
induced
platelet
aggregation
.

The
results
of
large
clinical
trials
have
demonstrated
an
overall
benefit
of
clopidogrel
over
aspirin
in
the
prevention
of
vascular
ischemic
events
(
myocardial
infarction
,
stroke
,
vascular
death
)
in
patients
with
a
history
of
symptomatic
atherosclerotic
disease
.

The
antiaggregating
effect
of
clopidogrel
is
attributed
to
an
irreversible
inhibition
of
ADP
binding
to
a
purinergic
receptor
present
at
the
platelet
surface
.

Clopidogrel
is
not
active
in
vitro
and
can
be
considered
a
precursor
of
an
active
metabolite
formed
in
the
liver
.

The
chemical
structure
of
this
active
metabolite
and
its
biological
activity
have
been
described
recently
.

Several
purinergic
receptors
have
been
described
on
platelets
;
P2X
(
1
)
,
a
calcium
channel
,
and
P2Y1
a
Gq
-
coupled
seven
-
transmembrane
domain
receptor
,
have
been
found
not
to
be
antagonized
by
clopidogrel
.

Another
Gi
(
2
)
-
coupled
receptor
(
named
P2Y12
)
has
been
recently
cloned
and
stably
expressed
in
CHO
cells
.

These
cells
displayed
a
strong
affinity
for
(
33
)
P
-
2MeS
-
ADP
,
a
stable
analogue
of
ADP
,
the
binding
characteristics
of
which
corresponded
in
all
points
to
those
observed
on
platelets
.

The
binding
of
(
33
)
P
-
2MeS
-
ADP
to
these
cells
was
strongly
inhibited
by
the
active
metabolite
of
clopidogrel
with
a
potency
that
was
consistent
with
that
observed
for
this
compound
on
platelets
.

In
these
transfected
CHO
cells
,
as
in
platelets
,
ADP
and
2MeS
-
ADP
induced
adenylyl
cyclase
downregulation
,
an
effect
that
was
inhibited
by
the
active
metabolite
of
clopidogrel
.

These
results
demonstrate
that
this
receptor
corresponds
to
the
previously
called
"
P2t
"
platelet
receptor
and
show
that
the
active
metabolite
of
clopidogrel
binds
in
a
covalent
manner
to
this
receptor
,
thus
explaining
how
it
blocks
the
aggregating
effect
of
ADP
on
platelets
.

It

Thus
,
the
cranio

is
predominantly
mediated
by

HT1B
receptors
as
well

Significant
receptor
affinities
of
metabolites
and
a
degradation
product
of
mometasone
furoate
.

Mometasone
furoate
(
MF
)
is
a
highly
potent
glucocorticoid
used
topically
to
treat
inflammation
in
the
lung
,
nose
and
on
the
skin
.

However
,
so
far
no
information
has
been
published
on
the
human
glucocorticoid
receptor
activity
of
the
metabolites
or
degradation
products
of
MF
.

We
have
now
determined
the
relative
receptor
binding
affinities
of
the
known
metabolite
6beta
-
OH
MF
and
the
degradation
product
9
,
11
-
epoxy
MF
to
understand
their
possible
contribution
to
undesirable
systemic
side
effects
.

In
competition
experiments
with
human
lung
glucocorticoid
receptors
we
have
determined
the
relative
receptor
affinities
(
RRA
)
of
these
substances
with
reference
to
dexamethasone
(
RRA
=
100
)
.

We
have
discovered
that
6beta
-
OH
MF
and
9
,
11
-
epoxy
MF
display
RRAs
of
206
+
/
-
15
and
220
+
/
-
22
,
respectively
.

This
level
of
activity
is
similar
to
that
of
the
clinically
used
inhaled
corticosteroid
flunisolide
(
RRA
180
+
/
-
11
)
.

Furthermore
we
observed
that
9
,
11
-
epoxy
MF
is
a
chemically
reactive
metabolite
.

In
recovery
experiments
with
human
plasma
and
lung
tissue
we
found
a
time
dependent
decrease
in
extractability
of
the
compound
.

Hence
,
we
provide
data
that
might
contribute
to
the
understanding
of
the
pharmacokinetics
as
well
as
the
clinical
effects
of
MF
.

Probing
for
a
hydrophobic
a
binding
register
in
prostate
-
specific
membrane
antigen
with
phenylalkylphosphonamidates
.

To
explore
for
the
existence
of
an
auxiliary
hydrophobic
binding
register
remote
from
the
active
site
of
PSMA
a
series
of
phenylalkylphosphonamidate
derivatives
of
glutamic
acid
were
synthesized
and
evaluated
for
their
inhibitory
potencies
against
PSMA
.

Both
the
phenyl
-
and
benzylphosphonamidates
(
1a
and
1b
)
exhibited
only
modest
inhibitory
potency
against
.

The
phenethyl
analog
1c
was
intermediate
in
inhibitory
potency
while
inhibitors
possessing
a
longer
alkyl
tether
from
the
phenyl
ring
,
resulted
in
markedly
improved
K
(
i
)
values
.

The
greatest
inhibitory
potency
was
obtained
for
the
inhibitors
in
which
the
phenyl
ring
was
extended
furthest
from
the
central
phosphorus
(
1f
,
n
=
5
and
1g
,
n
=
6
)
.

The
slightly
serrated
pattern
that
emerged
as
the
alkyl
tether
increased
from
three
to
six
methylene
units
suggests
that
inhibitory
potency
is
not
simply
correlated
to
increased
hydrophobicity
imparted
by
the
phenylalkyl
chain
,
but
rather
that
one
or
more
hydrophobic
binding
registers
may
exist
remote
from
the
substrate
recognition
architecture
in
the
active
site
of
PSMA
.

,
5
-
HT2C
,
D1

and
D3
receptor

and
functional
assays
.

Two
isomers
demonstrated
potent
D2

binding
(
Ki
<
3
nM
)
and
functional
antagonism
(
IC50
<
or

nM
)
activities
.

These
two
isomers
also
showed
moderate
affinity
for
the
5
-
HT2A
and
D3
receptors
.

A
third
isomer
was
devoid
of
significant
D2
receptor
binding
,
but
did
have
moderate
affinity
for
the
5

HT2A
and
D3
receptors
.

The
fourth
isomer
demonstrated
poor
affinity
for
all
the

tested
.

Most
significantly
,
the
stereochemistry
of
the
sulfoxide
moiety
played
a
dominant
role
in
the

the
results
of
a

the
clinical
effects
of
olanzapine
versus
clozapine
in
a
sample
of
neuroleptic

.

Receptor

was
evaluated
in
different
cortical
areas
and
in
basal

using
[

fluoro

ethyl

spiperone
(
[

)
and
positron

(

.

A
total
of
15
neuroleptic

patients
completed
the
study
undergoing
a
baseline
and
a
post

treatment
PET
scan
(

,
nine
patients
,
one
female
;
clozapine
,
six
patients
,

)
8
weeks
after
starting
treatment
.

PET
data
were
analysed
both
by
regions
of
interest
and
on
a
voxel
-
by

voxel
basis
using
Statistical
Parametric
Mapping
(
SPM96
)
.

Olanzapine
and
clozapine
induced
a
similar
and
significant
inhibition
of
[
18F
]
FESP
binding
index
in
the
cortex
.

In
the
basal
ganglia
,
receptor
occupancy
was
significantly
higher
with
olanzapine
than
with
clozapine
(
p
=
0
.
0018
)
.

By
contrast
,
no
differences
in
receptor
occupancy
were
detected
at
the
level
of
the
pituitary
gland
.

Clinical
outcomes
,
in
particular
a
full
extra
pyramidal
tolerability
,
were
similar
.

In
this
sample
of
neuroleptic
-
refractory
schizophrenic
patients
,
olanzapine
and
clozapine
showed
a
different
pattern
of
occupancy
of
D2

like
receptor
despite
a
common
lack
of
extrapyramidal

Brain

NR2B
receptor
is
responsible
for
the
anti

effect
of
an
NR2B
subunit
-
selective
antagonist
CP
-
101
,
606
in
a
rat
chronic

model
.

In
order
to
examine
the
site
of
action
of
an
NR2B
subtype
-
selective
NMDA
antagonist
CP
-
101
,
606
,
we
investigated
its
analgesic
effect
in
a
rat
model
of
neuropathic
pain
at
various
routes
of
administration
.

Mechanical
allodynia
was
induced
by
chronic
constriction
injury
(
CCI
)
of
the
sciatic
nerve
in
male
Sprague
-
Dawley
rats
.

Subcutaneous
treatment
of
the
animals
with
CP
-
101
,
606
at
10
mg
/
kg
significantly
inhibited
CCI
-
induced
mechanical
allodynia
.

Intracerebroventricular
injection
of
CP
-
101
,
606
at
10
,
30
and
100
nmol
also
inhibited
the
mechanical
allodynia
in
a
dose
-
dependent
manner
,
the
statistically
significant
effect
being
achieved
at
the
highest
dose
tested
(
100
nmol
)
without
producing
any
behavioral
abnormalities
.

However
,
intrathecal
injection
of
CP
-
101
,
606
at
a
dose
of
300
nmol
failed
to
inhibit
CCI
-
induced
allodynia
.

A
receptor
binding
assay
using
rat
forebrain
and
spinal
cord
membrane
preparations
demonstrated
that
[
3H
]
CP
-
101
,
606
bound
to
the
brain
NR2B
receptor
with
a
greater
extent
compared
to
the
spinal
cord
one
.

These
findings
suggest
that
the
anti
-
allodynia

Adaptation
to
hypoxia
and
maintenance
of
O
(

)
homeostasis
involve
a
wide
range
of
responses
that
occur
at
different
organizational
levels
in
the
body
.

One
of
the
most
important
transcription
factors
that
activate

is
hypoxia

Nitric
oxide
(
NO
)
mediates
a
variety
of
biological
effects
including
relaxation
of

.

We
investigated
the
effect
of
the
clinically
used
nitrates

ISDN
)
,
and
sodium

on

transcriptional

.

We
demonstrate
that
among
the
three
nitrates
,
only
SNP
inhibits
HIF

1
activation
in
response
to
hypoxia
.

In
contrast
,
NTG

does
not
affect

SNP
inhibits
the
accumulation
of

the

and
the

that
is
not

Amylin
receptors
:
molecular
composition
and
pharmacology
.

Several
receptors
which
bind
the
hormone
AMY
(
amylin
)
with
high
affinity
have
now
been
identified
.

The
minimum
binding
unit
is
composed
of
the
CT
(
calcitonin
)
receptor
at
its
core
,
plus
a
RAMP
(
receptor
activity
modifying
protein
)
.

The
receptors
have
been
named
AMY
(

)
,
AMY
(

)
and
AMY

in

with
the

of
the
CT
receptor
(
CT
(
(

)
)
with
RAMP1
,
RAMP2
and
RAMP3
respectively
.

The
challenge
is
now
to
determine
the
localization
and
pharmacological
nature
of
each
of
these
receptors
.

Recent
attempts
to
achieve
these

Genetic

We
analyzed
clinical

)
enrolled
in
a

of

and
the

.

Subjects
were
genotyped
for
the
following
single

:

At

(

with
the

There
was
a

and
the
number
of

defined
by
these
three
SNPs
(

,
suggesting
an

These

have
important

the
role
of

in
susceptibility
to

infections
.

Pseudohypoaldosteronism
type
1
and
the
genes
encoding
prostasin
,
alpha

,
and
Nedd4
.

Pseudohypoaldosteronism
type
1
(
PHA1
)
,
a
rare
disorder
of
infancy
,
presents
with
potential
life
-
threatening
salt
wasting
and
failure
to
thrive
.

Thus
far
,
PHA1
has
been
attributed
to
mutations
affecting
the
mineralocorticoid
receptor
or
any
of
the
three
subunits
assembling
the
amiloride
-
sensitive
epithelial
sodium
channel
(
ENaC
)
.

However
,
a
lot
of
patients
with
a
phenotype
resembling
PHA1
,
show
no
defects
in
these
proteins
,
making
it
likely
that
further
genes
are
involved
in
the
aetiology
of
this
disease
.

Recent
studies
have
elucidated
additional
participants
(
alpha

spectrin
and
members
of
the
families
of
transmembrane
serine
proteases
,
ubiquitin

protein
ligases

and

and
glucocorticoid

respectively
)
regulating
and
/
or
interacting
in
the
complex
pathway
of
sodium
retention
in
the
amiloride
-
sensitive
distal
nephron
.

This
led
us
to
investigate
whether
PHA1
can
also
be
associated
with
mutations
in
some
of
these
genes
.

Our
data
suggest
that
at
least
the
prostasin
gene
might
be
excluded
as
a
causative
locus
.

We

and
characterized
it

At

60
mV
,
succinate
(
4

and

(

)
generated
inward

due
to
translocation
of
three
sodium

and
one
divalent
dicarboxylate
,
whereas
oxalate
(
2
carbons
)
and
malonate
(

carbons
)
did
not
.

The
cis

dicarboxylate
maleate
produced
currents
smaller
in
magnitude
,
whereas
the
trans

fumarate
generated
currents
similar
to

.

The

elicited
inward

,
whereas
aspartate

showed
hardly
detectable
currents
.

The
C

dicarboxylates
glutarate
and
alpha

ketoglutarate
produced
larger
currents
than
succinate
;
glutamate
and

Kinetic

revealed

values
of

13
microM
for

,
values
close
to
the
plasma
concentration
of
these
compounds
.

For
both
compounds
,
the
K
(
0

)
was
independent
of
voltage
,
whereas
the
maximal
current
increased
with
hyperpolarization
.

As

rat
and
flounder
orthologs
,
hNaDC

was
hardly
inhibited
by
lithium
concentrations
up
to

.

In
the
absence
of
sodium
,
however
,
lithium
can
mediate
succinate

.

The
narrow
substrate
specificity
prevents
interaction
of
drugs

State

Mibefradil

with

reactivity
with
other
classes
of
ion
channels
,
including
K

,
Cl

,
and
Na

channels
.

Using
whole

cell
voltage

,
we
examined
mibefradil
block
of
four
Na

channel
isoforms
expressed
in
human
embryonic

cells
:
Nav1

(

,

.

Mibefradil

in
a
use

manner
,
indicating
preferential
binding
to
states

Mibefradil
blocked

)
.

We
further
probed
the
interaction
of
mibefradil
with
inactivated
Nav1
.
5
channels
.

Neither
the
degree
nor
the
time
course
of
block
was
dependent
on
the
stimulus
duration
,
which
dramatically
changed
the
residency
time
of
channels
in
the
fast
-
inactivated
state
.

In
addition
,
inhibiting
the
binding
of
the
fast
inactivation
lid
(
Nav1
.
5
ICM
+
MTSET
)
did
not
alter
mibefradil
block
,
confirming
that
the
drug
does
not
preferentially
interact
with
the
fast
-
inactivated
state
.

We
also
tested
whether
mibefradil
interacted
with
slow
-
inactivated
state
(
s
)
.

When
selectively
applied
to
channels
after
inducing
slow
inactivation
with
a
60

s
pulse
to
-
10
mV
,
mibefradil
(
1
microM
)
produced
45
%
fractional
block
in
Nav1

5
and
greater
block
(
88
%
)
in
an
isoform
(
Nav1

4
)
that
slow
-
inactivates
more
completely
.

Our
results
suggest
that
mibefradil
blocks
Na
+
channels
in
a
state
-
dependent
manner
that
does
not
depend
on
fast
inactivation
but
probably
involves
interaction
with
one
or
more
slow

(

The

a
major
role
in
controlling

acting
as
a

The

complex
was
identified
as
the
molecular
correlate
of
the

.

Furthermore

KCNQ3
channel
alpha
subunits
are
mutated
in
families
with
benign

,
a

.

Enhancement
of
KCNQ2

potassium
currents
may
provide
an
important
target
for
antiepileptic
drug
development
.

Here
,
we
show
that
meclofenamic
acid
(
meclofenamate
)
and
diclofenac
,
two
related
molecules
previously
used
as
anti

inflammatory
drugs
,
act
as
novel
KCNQ2

channel
openers
.

Extracellular
application
of
meclofenamate
(

)
and
diclofenac
(
EC

resulted
in
the
activation
of
KCNQ2
/
Q3
K
(

)
currents
,
heterologously
expressed
in
Chinese
hamster
ovary

.

Both
openers
activated
KCNQ2

Q3
channels
by
causing
a
hyperpolarizing
shift
of
the
voltage
activation
curve
(
-
23
and
-
15
mV
,
respectively
)
and
by
markedly
slowing
the
deactivation
kinetics
.

The
effects
of
the
drugs
were
stronger
on
KCNQ2
than
on
KCNQ3
channel
alpha
subunits
.

In
contrast
,
they
did
not
enhance
KCNQ1
K
(
+
)
currents
.

Both
openers
increased
KCNQ2
/
Q3
current
amplitude
at
physiologically
relevant
potentials
and
led
to
hyperpolarization
of
the
resting
membrane
potential
.

In
cultured
cortical
neurons
,
meclofenamate
and
diclofenac
enhanced
the
M
-
current
and
reduced
evoked
and
spontaneous
action
potentials
,
whereas
in

diclofenac
exhibited
an
anticonvulsant
activity
(

.

These
compounds
potentially
constitute
novel

treatment
of

distinct
from
leukotriene
receptor
antagonism
.

BACKGROUND
:
Pranlukast
,
a
cysteinyl
leukotriene
receptor
1
(
CysLTR1
)
antagonist
,
inhibits
not
only
airway
smooth
muscle
contraction
,
but
also
allergic
inflammation
.

The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
determine
the
mechanism
of
pranlukast
-
induced
interleukin
-
5
(
IL
-
5
)
inhibition
in
allergic
inflammation
.

METHODS
:
Surgically
resected
human
lung
tissue
was
passively
sensitized
in
vitro
with
mite
-
allergen
-
sensitized
sera
,
followed
by
stimulation
with
mite
allergen
after
pretreatment
of
the
tissue
with
pranlukast
,
dexamethasone
,
or
both
.

The
IL
-
5
protein
level
in
the
culture
medium
was
measured
,
and
in
situ
hybridization
of
IL
-
5
and
CysLTR1
mRNA
was
performed
using
lung
tissues
.

RESULTS
:
Pretreatment
of
lung
tissues
with
pranlukast
alone
significantly
decreased
the
amount
of
IL
-
5
protein
in
the
culture
medium
by
40
%
.

The
combination
of
pranlukast
and
dexamethasone
synergistically
enhanced
this
effect
.

Quantitative
in
situ
hybridization
with
image
analysis
revealed
abundant
expression
of
IL
-
5
mRNA
in
eosinophils
,
lymphocytes
,
and
mast
cells
in
sensitized
and
allergen
-
stimulated
lung
tissues
.

CysLTR1
mRNA
was
detected
in
macrophages
,
smooth
muscle
cells
,
eosinophils
,
and
mast
cells
,
but
was
less
expressed
in
lymphocytes
.

Pranlukast
-
induced
inhibition
of
IL
-
5
mRNA
expression
was
noted
in
various
cells
,
irrespective
of
their
CysLTR1
mRNA
expression
status
.

In
addition
,
cysteinyl
leukotrienes
per
se
failed
to
upregulate
the
IL
-
5
production
.

CONCLUSION
:
Our
results
indicate
that
pranlukast
inhibits
IL
-
5
synthesis
via
a
mechanism
distinct
from
CysLTR1
antagonism
.

Further
insights
into
the
effect
of
quinidine
in
short
QT
syndrome
caused
by
a
mutation
in
HERG
.

INTRODUCTION
:
The
principal
aim
of
this
study
was
to
assess
the
efficacy
of
quinidine
in
suppressing
IKr
in
vitro
and
in
modulating
the
rate
dependence
of
the
QT
interval
in
the
"
SQT1
"
form
of
the
short
QT
syndrome
.

METHODS
AND
RESULTS
:
Graded
-
intensity
bicycle
exercise
testing
was
performed
off
drug
in
three
patients
and
during
oral
quinidine
in
two
patients
with
short
QT
syndrome
and
compared
to
a
control
group
of
healthy
normal
subjects
.

The
in
vitro
effects
of
quinidine
on
currents
in
patch
clamp
technique
were
investigated
.

Off
drugs
QTpV3
/
heart
rate
correlation
is
much
weaker
in
patients
with
short
QT
syndrome
,
and
QTpV3
shortens
less
with
heart
rate
increase
compared
to
normal
subjects
.

In
addition
to
prolonging
the
QT
interval
into
the
normal
range
,
quinidine
restored
the
heart
rate
dependence
of
the
QT
interval
toward
a
range
of
adaptation
reported
for
normal
subjects
.

Data
from
heterologous
expression
of
wild
-
type
and
mutant
HERG
genes
indicate
the
mutation
causes
a
20
-
fold
increase
in
IC50
of
d
-
sotalol
but
only
a
5
.
8
-
fold
increase
in
IC50
of
quinidine
.

CONCLUSION
:
Oral
quinidine
is
effective
in
suppressing
the
gain
of
function
in
IKr
responsible
for
some
cases
of
short
QT
syndrome
with
a
mutation
in
HERG
and
thus
restoring
normal
rate
dependence
of
the
QT
interval
and
rendering
ventricular
tachycardia
/
ventricular
fibrillation
noninducible
.

Effect
of
apocalmodulin
on
recombinant
human
brain

.

In
this
work
,
we
report
that
the
recombinant
glutathione

)

-

acid

(
HGAD
)

(
GAD
)
(

-
HGAD65
)
fusion
protein
or
free
truncated
HGAD65
,
were
activated
by
apocalmodulin
(
ApoCaM
)
to
an
extent
of
60
%
.

Both
truncated
forms
of
GAD67
(
tGAD67
)
,
HGAD67
(
Delta1
-
70
)
and
HGAD67
(
Delta1
-
90
)
,
were
markedly
activated
by
ApoCaM
to
an
extent
of
141
and
85
%
,
respectively
,
while
GST
-
HGAD67
was
not
significantly
affected
.

The
activation
appears
to
be
due
to
an
increase
of
GAD
affinity
for
its
cofactor
,
pyridoxal
phosphate
(
PLP
)
.

This
conclusion
is
based
on
the
following
observations
.

Firstly
,
the
V
(
max
)
of
GAD
was
increased
when
ApoCaM
was
present
whereas
the
affinity
for
the
substrate
,
glutamate
,
was
not
affected
.

Secondly
,
the
affinity
of
GAD
for
PLP
was
increased
in
the
presence
of
ApoCaM
.

Thirdly
,
results
from
calmodulin
-
agarose
affinity
column
chromatography
studies
indicated
a
direct
interaction
or
binding
between
ApoCaM
and
GAD
.

Fourthly
,
ApoCaM
was
found
to
be
copurified
with
GAD65
/
GAD67
by
anti
-
GAD65
/
67
immunoaffinity
column
using
rat
brain
extract
.

Hence
,
it
is
proposed
that
a
conformational
change
is
induced
when
ApoCaM
interacts
with
GAD65
or
tGAD67
,
resulting
in
an
increase
of
GAD
affinity
for
PLP
and
the
activation
of
GAD
.

The
physiological
significance
of
the
interaction
between
GAD
and
ApoCaM
is
discussed
.

Crystal

)
,
a
member
of
the
beta

family
of
pyridoxal
phosphate

enzymes
,
catalyzes
the
deamination
of

to
yield
pyruvate
or

.

The

has
been

at

A

by
molecular
replacement
.

The
structure
is
a
homodimer
and
reveals
a
fold
typical
for
beta
-
family
PLP
-
dependent
enzymes
.

Each
monomer
serves
as
an
active
unit
and
is
subdivided
into
two
distinct
domains
:
a
small
domain
and
a
PLP
-
binding
domain
that
covalently
anchors
the
cofactor
.

Both
domains
show
the
typical
open
alpha
/
beta
architecture
of
PLP
enzymes
.

Comparison
with
the
rSDH
-
(
PLP

)
holo
-
enzyme
reveals
a
large
structural
difference
in
active
sites
caused
by
the
artifical

methylserine
.

Furthermore
,
the
activity
of
hSDH
-
PLP
was
assayed
and
it
proved
to
show
catalytic
activity
.

That
suggests
that
the
structure
of
hSDH

PLP
is
the
first
structure
of
the
active

Carvedilol
modulates
the
expression
of
hypoxia

inducible
factor
-
1alpha
and
vascular
endothelial
growth
factor
in
a
rat
model
of
volume
-
overload
heart
failure
.

BACKGROUND
:
The
use
of
beta
-
blockers
has
emerged
as
a
beneficial
treatment
for
congestive
heart
failure
.

Hypoxia
-
inducible
factor
-
1alpha
(
HIF
-
1alpha
)
is
tightly
regulated
in
the
ventricular
myocardium
.

However
,
the
expression
of
HIF
-
1alpha
in
chronic
heart
failure
resulting
from
volume
overload
and
after
treatment
with
beta
-
blocker
is
little
known
.

METHODS
AND
RESULTS
:
To
test
the
hypothesis
that
HIF
-
1alpha
plays
a
role
in
the
failing
myocardium
because
of
volume
overload
,
an
aorta
-
caval
shunt
was
created
for
4
weeks
in
adult
Sprague
-
Dawley
rats
to
induce
volume
-
overload
heart
failure
.

Carvedilol
at
50
mg
/
kg
body
weight
per
day
after
surgery
was
given
.

The
heart

and

increased
from

in
the

in
the

)
.

Treatment
with
carvedilol
in
the
shunt
group
reversed
the
heart
weight
and
ventricular
dimension
to
the
baseline
values
.

Western
blot
showed
that
HIF
-
1alpha
,
vascular
endothelial
growth
factor
(
VEGF
)
,
and
brain
natriuretic
peptide
(
BNP
)
proteins
were
upregulated
and
nerve
growth
factor
-
beta
(
NGF
-
beta
)
downregulated
in
the
shunt
group
.

Real
-
time
polymerase
chain
reaction
showed
that
mRNA
of
HIF
-
1alpha
,
VEGF
,
and
BNP
increased
and
mRNA
of
NGF
-
beta
decreased
in
the
shunt
group
.

Treatment
with
carvedilol
reversed
both
protein
and
mRNA
of
HIF
-
1alpha
,
VEGF
,
BNP
,
and
NGF
-
beta
to
the
baseline
values
.

Increased
immunohistochemical
labeling
of
HIF
-
1alpha
,
VEGF
,
and
BNP
in
the
ventricular
myocardium
was
observed
in
the
shunt
group
and
carvedilol
again
normalized
the
labeling
.

CONCLUSION
:
HIF
-
1alpha
and
VEGF
mRNA
and
protein
expression
were
upregulated
in
the
rat
model
of
volume
-
overload
heart
failure
.

Treatment
with
carvedilol
is
associated
with
a
reversal
of
abnormal
regulation
of
HIF
-
1alpha
and
VEGF
in
the
failing
ventricular
myocardium
.

Mutation
of
arginine
228
to
lysine
enhances
the
glucosyltransferase
activity
of
bovine
beta
-

,
4

galactosyltransferase
I
.

Beta
-
1
,
4
-
galactosyltransferase
I
(
beta4Gal
-
T1
)
normally
transfers
Gal
from
UDP
-
Gal
to
GlcNAc
in
the
presence
of
Mn
(
2
+
)
ion
(
Gal
-
T
activity
)
and
also
transfers
Glc
from
UDP
-
Glc
to
GlcNAc
(
Glc
-
T
activity
)
,
albeit
at
only
0
.
3
%
efficiency
.

In
addition
,
alpha
-
lactalbumin
(
LA
)
enhances
this
Glc
-
T
activity
more
than
25
times
.

Comparison
of
the
crystal
structures
of
UDP
-
Gal
-
and
UDP
-
Glc
-
bound
beta4Gal
-
T1
reveals
that
the
O4
hydroxyl
group
in
both
Gal
and
Glc
moieties
forms
a
hydrogen
bond
with
the
side
chain
carboxylate
group
of
Glu317
.

The
orientation
of
the
O4
hydroxyl
of
glucose
causes
a
steric
hindrance
to
the
side
chain
carboxylate
group
of
Glu317
,
accounting
for
the
enzyme
'
s
low
Glc
-
T
activity
.

In
this
study
,
we
show
that
mutation
of
Arg228
,
a
residue
in
the
vicinity
of
Glu317
,
to
lysine
(
R228K
-
Gal
-
T1
)
results
in
a
15
-
fold
higher
Glc
-
T
activity
,
which
is
further
enhanced
by
LA
to
nearly
25
%
of
the
Gal
-
T
activity
of
the
wild
type
.

The
kinetic
parameters
indicate
that
the
main
effect
of
the
mutation
of
Arg228
to
lysine
is
on
the
k
(
cat
)
of
Glc
-
T
,
which
increases
3
-
4
-
fold
,
both
in
the
absence
and
in
the
presence
of
LA
;
simultaneously
,
the
k
(
cat
)
for
the
Gal
-
T
reaction
is
reduced
30

fold
.

A
resolution
shows
that
the
Asp318
side
chain
exhibits
a
minor
alternate
conformation
,
compared
to
that
in
the
wild
type
.

This
alternate
conformation
now
causes
a
steric
hindrance
to
the
O4
hydroxyl
group
of
the
Gal
moiety
of
UDP
-
Gal
,
probably
causing
the
dissociation
of
UDP

and
the

Apolipoprotein

)
safeguards

against

induced
by
gentamicin
C
.

Megalin
,
a
family
of
endocytic
receptors
related
to
the
low
-
density
lipoprotein
(
LDL
)
receptor
,
is
a
major
pathway
for
proximal
tubular
aminoglycoside
accumulation
.

We
previously
reported
that
aminoglycoside
antibiotics
reduce
SGLT1
-
dependent
glucose
transport
in
pig
proximal
tubular
epithelial
LLC
-
PK1
cells
in
parallel
with
the
order
of
their
nephrotoxicity
.

In
this
study
,
using
a
model
of
gentamicin
C
(
GMC
)
-
induced
reduction
in
SGLT1
activity
,
we
examined
whether
ligands
for
megalin
protect
LLC
-
PK1
cells
from
the
GMC
-
induced
reduction
in
SGLT1
activity
.

We
employed
apolipoprotein
E3
(
apoE3
)
and
lactoferrin
as
ligands
for
megalin
.

Then
the
cells
were
treated
with
various
concentrations
of
apoE3
,
lactoferrin
and
bovine
serum
albumin
with
or
without
100
microg
/
ml
of
GMC
,
and
the
SGLT1
-
dependent
methyl
alpha
-
D
-
glucopyranoside
(
AMG
)
uptake
and
levels
of
SGLT1
expression
were
determined
.

As
a
result
,
we
demonstrated
that
the
apoE3
significantly
protects
these
cells
from
GMC
-
induced
reduction
in
AMG
uptake
,
but
neither
lactoferrin
nor
albumin
does
.

In
accord
with
a
rise
in
AMG
uptake
activity
,
the
mRNA
and
protein
levels
of
SGLT1
were
apparently
up
-
regulated
in
the
presence
of
apoE3
.

Furthermore
,
we
found
that
the
uptake
of
[
3H
]
gentamicin
is
decreased
by
apoE3
,
and
that
apoE3
showed
obvious
protection
against
the
GMC
-
dependent
N
-
acetyl
-
beta
-
D
-
glucosamidase
(
NAG
)
release
from
LLC
-
PK1
cells
.

Thus
,
these
results
indicate
that
apoE3
could
be
a
valuable
tool
for
the
prevention
of
aminoglycoside
nephrotoxicity
.

Synergistic
cytotoxicity
was
demonstrated
,
and
pemetrexed
significantly
decreased
the
amount
of
phosphorylated
Akt
,
enhanced
apoptosis
,
and
increased
the
expression
of
dCK
in
A549
and
Calu

as
well
as
the
expression
of
the
human
nucleoside
equilibrative

(
hENT1
)
in
all
cell
lines
.

PCR
demonstrated
a
correlation
between
dCK
expression
and
gemcitabine
sensitivity
,
whereas
expression
of
TS
,
DHFR
,
and
GARFT
was
predictive
of
pemetrexed
chemosensitivity
.

These
data
demonstrated
that
1
)
gemcitabine
and
pemetrexed
synergistically
interact
against
NSCLC
cells
through
the
suppression
of
Akt
phosphorylation
and
induction
of

;

the

of

and

Genetic
predictors
of
the
maximum
doses
patients
receive
during
clinical
use
of
the
anti
-
epileptic
drugs
carbamazepine
and
phenytoin
.

Phenytoin
and
carbamazepine
are
effective
and
inexpensive
anti
-
epileptic
drugs
(
AEDs
)
.

As
with
many
AEDs
,
a
broad
range
of
doses
is
used
,
with
the
final
"
maintenance
"
dose
normally
determined
by
trial
and
error
.

Although
many
genes
could
influence
response
to
these
medicines
,
there
are
obvious
candidates
.

Both
drugs
target
the
alpha
-
subunit
of
the
sodium
channel
,
encoded
by
the
SCN
family
of
genes
.

Phenytoin
is
principally
metabolized
by
CYP2C9
,
and
both
are
probable
substrates
of
the
drug
transporter
P
-
glycoprotein
.

We
therefore
assessed
whether
variation
in
these
genes
associates
with
the
clinical
use
of
carbamazepine
and
phenytoin
in
cohorts
of
425
and
281
patients
,
respectively
.

We
report
that
a
known
functional
polymorphism
in
CYP2C9
is
highly
associated
with
the
maximum
dose
of
phenytoin
(
P
=
0
.
0066
)
.

We
also
show
that
an
intronic
polymorphism
in
the
SCN1A
gene
shows
significant
association
with
maximum
doses
in
regular
usage
of
both
carbamazepine
and
phenytoin
(
P
=
0
.
0051
and
P
=
0
.
014
,
respectively
)
.

This
polymorphism
disrupts
the
consensus
sequence
of
the
5
'
splice
donor
site
of
a
highly
conserved
alternative
exon
(
5N
)
,
and
it
significantly
affects
the
proportions
of
the
alternative
transcripts
in
individuals
with
a
history
of
epilepsy
.

These
results
provide
evidence
of
a
drug
target
polymorphism
associated
with
the
clinical
use
of
AEDs
and
set
the
stage
for
a
prospective
evaluation
of
how
pharmacogenetic
diagnostics
can
be
used
to
improve
dosing
decisions
in
the
use
of
phenytoin
and
carbamazepine
.

Although
the
case
made
here
is
compelling
,
our
results
cannot
be
considered
definitive
or
ready
for
clinical
application
until
they
are
confirmed
by
independent
replication

Antimyeloma
effects
of
a
novel
synthetic
retinoid
Am80
(
Tamibarotene
)
through
inhibition
of
angiogenesis
.

In
multiple
myeloma
(
MM
)
,
the
interaction
between
myeloma
cells
and
bone
marrow
microenvironment
has
an
important
role
in
the
pathogenesis
of
MM
.

We
first
examined
the
inducing
effect
of
myeloma
cells
on
migration
of
human
umbilical
vein
vascular
endothelial
cells
(
HUVECs
)
.

Five
myeloma
cell
lines
produced
varying
amounts
of
VEGF
,
and
migration
of
HUVECs
was
induced
by
coculture
with
myeloma
cells
.

We
next
examined
the
inhibitory
effect
of
a
novel
synthetic
retinoid
Am80
(
Tamibarotene
)
on
both
myeloma
cells
and
HUVECs
.

Am80
is
specific
for
the
retinoic
-
acid
receptor
-
alpha
/
beta
,
and
has
therapeutic
effects
in
all
-
trans
retinoic
acid
resistant
acute
promyelocytic
leukemia
.

Am80
slightly
inhibited
the
growth
of
both
myeloma
cells
and
HUVECs
,
and
remarkably
inhibited
the
growth
of
HUVECs
stimulated
by
VEGF
.

Am80
showed
little
growth
inhibition
of
bone
marrow
stromal
cells
(
BMSCs
)
,
but
it
markedly
inhibited
migration
of
HUVECs
by
cocultured
myeloma
cells
.

Am80
inhibited
VEGF
-
induced
phosphorylation
of
VEGF
receptor
.

In
addition
,
VEGF
-
induced
formation
of
tube
-
like
structures
in
vitro
and
neovascularization
in
mouse
corneas
were
significantly
inhibited
by
Am80
.

These
findings
clearly
demonstrate
that
Am80
is
a
potential
inhibitor
of
angiogenesis
caused
by
the
interaction
between
vascular
endothelial
cells
and
myeloma
cells
,
and
might
be
a
useful
therapeutic
agent
against
MM
.

Effects
of
inhibition
of
urokinase
-
type
plasminogen
activator
(
u
-
PA
)
by
amiloride
in
the
cornea
and
tear
fluid
of
eyes
irradiated
with
UVB
.

The
purpose
of
the
present
study
was
to
test
our
hypothesis
that
amiloride
,
a
specific
u
-
PA
inhibitor
,
effectively
decreases
u
-
PA
activity
in
cornea
as
well
as
in
tear
fluid
and
favourably
affects
corneal
healing
.

Therefore
,
comparative
histochemical
and
biochemical
studies
of
u
-
PA
and
the
effects
of
amiloride
were
performed
on
rabbit
corneas

fluid
using
the
sensitive
fluorogenic
substrate
Z
-
Gly
-
Gly
-
Arg
-

-
amino
-

-
trifluoromethylcoumarin
.

Rabbit
eyes
were
repeatedly
irradiated
with
UVB
for
9
days
and
during
the
irradiation
topically
treated
with
amiloride
(
1
mg
/
ml
saline
)
or
placebo
(
saline
)
(
dropwise
,
5
times
daily
)
.

Results
show
that
in
placebo
-
treated
eyes
,
UVB
evoked
the
appearance
of
u
-
PA
activity
in
cornea
and
tear
fluid
in
early
stages
of
irradiation
,
and
u
-
PA
levels
increased
during
irradiation
.

Corneal
epithelium
was
gradually
lost
and
remnants
of
the
epithelium
as
well
as
keratocytes
in
the
upper
part
of
corneal
stroma
showed
high
u
-
PA
activity
.

Finally
,
corneas
lost
their
epithelium
completely
.

In
corneal
stroma
,
numerous
u
-
PA
-
containing
inflammatory
cells
were
present
.

Corneas
were
vascularized
.

When
amiloride
was
dropped
on
the
eye
surface
on
the
first
day
of
irradiation
and
subsequently
daily
until
the
end
of
the
experiment
,
u
-
PA
activity
in
both
cornea
and
tear
fluid
was
strongly
inhibited
.

Corneas
were
covered
with
a
continuous
epithelium
until
the
end
of
the
experiment
.

The
number
of
inflammatory
cells
was
significantly
decreased
.

Corneal
vascularization
was
reduced
by
50
%
.

In
conclusion
,
early
application
of
amiloride
inhibited
u
-
PA
activity
in
UVB
-
irradiated
corneas
as
well
as
in
tear
fluid
and
diminished
the
development
of
corneal
pathology
.

used
to

.

To
significantly
improve
the
pharmacological
properties
of
the
drug
,
a
pegylated
form
of
IFNalpha
(

)
was
developed
(

.

This

IFNalpha
(

(
(

is
obtained
by
the

of
one

polymer
to
a

of

.

Here
,
we
report
the

analysis
of
the

K121
,
K164
,
and
K70
,
respectively
,
in
comparison
with
unmodified
IFNalpha
(
2a
)
.

Our
binding
studies
,
using
the
surface
plasmon
resonance
technique
,
show
that
the
pegylation
does
not
abolish
the
binding
to
the
receptor
,
but
significantly
reduces
the
affinity
mainly
due
to
a
change
of
the
association
rate
.

The
results
are
supported
by
modeling
and
simulation
of
the
binding
,
using
Self

Avoiding
-
Walk
calculations
for
the
polymer
conformations
.

A
correlation
between
the
structural
parameters
and
the
kinetic
and
thermodynamic
parameters
of
the
binding
of
the
positional
isomers
could
be
established
.

For
the
Isomer
-
K31
and
-
K164
,
the
PEG
-
polymer
attachment
point
is
located
in
proximity
to
the

interface
,
and
the
isomers
display
affinity
in
the
range
150
-
520
nM
in
an
enthalpy

driven
binding
process
.

In
contrast
for
the
Isomer
-
K134
,
-
K131
,
-
K121
,
and
-
K70
,
the
PEG
-
polymer
is
attached
remotely
from
the
binding
interface
,
and
the
isomers
exhibit
a
higher
affinity
(
32
-
76
nM
)
in
an
entropy
-
driven
binding
process
.

This
study
constitutes
an
essential
collection
of
knowledge
on
which
the
interaction
of
(
40

Beta1
adrenergic
receptor
-
mediated
enhancement
of
hippocampal
CA3
network
activity
.

Norepinephrine
is
an
endogenous
neurotransmitter
distributed
throughout
the
mammalian
brain
.

In
higher
cortical
structures
such
as
the
hippocampus
,
norepinephrine
,
via
beta
adrenergic
receptor
(
AR
)
activation
,
has
been
shown
to
reinforce
the
cognitive
processes
of
attention
and
memory
.

In
this
study
,
we
investigated
the
effect
of
beta1AR
activation
on
hippocampal
cornu
ammonis
3
(
CA3
)
network
activity
.

AR
expression
was
first
determined
using
immunocytochemistry
with
antibodies
against
beta1ARs
,
which
were
found
to
be
exceptionally
dense
in
hippocampal
CA3
pyramidal
neurons
.

CA3
network
activity
was
then
examined
in
vitro
using
field
potential
recordings
in
rat
brain
slices
.

The
selective
betaAR
agonist
isoproterenol
caused
an
enhancement
of
hippocampal
CA3
network
activity
,
as
measured
by
an
increase
in
frequency
of
spontaneous
burst
discharges
recorded
in
the
CA3
region
.

In
the
presence
of
alphaAR
blockade
,
concentration
-
response
curves
for
isoproterenol
,
norepinephrine
,
and
epinephrine
suggested
that
a
beta1AR
was
involved
in
this
response
,
and
the
rank
order
of
potency
was
isoproterenol
>
norepinephrine
=
epinephrine
.

Finally
,
equilibrium
dissociation
constants
(
pK
(
b
)
)
of
subtype
-
selective
betaAR
antagonists
were
functionally
determined
to
characterize
the
AR
subtype
modulating
hippocampal
CA3
activity
.

The
selective
beta1AR
antagonists
atenolol
and
metoprolol
blocked
isoproterenol
-
induced
enhancement
,
with
apparent
K
(
b
)
values
of
85
+
/
-
36
and
3
.
9
+
/
-
1
.
7
nM
,
respectively
.

In
contrast
,
the
selective
beta2AR
antagonists
ICI
-
118
,
551
and
butoxamine
inhibited
isoproterenol
-
mediated
enhancement
with
apparent
low
affinities
(
K
(
b
)
of
222
+
/
-
61
and
9268

/
-
512
nM
,
respectively
)
.

Together
,
this
pharmacological
profile
of
subtype
-
selective
betaAR
antagonists
indicates
that
in
this
model
,
beta1AR
activation
is
responsible
for
the
enhanced
hippocampal
CA3
network
activity
initiated
by
isoproterenol
.

Diethylcarbamazine
activity
against
Brugia
malayi
microfilariae
is
dependent
on
inducible
nitric

and
the
cyclooxygenase

BACKGROUND
:
Diethylcarbamazine
(
DEC
)
has
been
used
for
many
years
in
the
treatment
of
human
lymphatic
filariasis
.

Its
mode
of
action
is
not
well

but
it
is
known
to
interact
with
the

and
cyclooxygenase
(
COX
)
pathways
to
the
activity
of
DEC
against

METHODS
:
B

malayi
microfilariae
were
injected

mice
and
parasitaemia
was
measured
24
hours
later
.

DEC
was
then
administered

mice
with
and
without

DEC

were
administered
to
microfilaraemic
iNOS
-
/
-
mice
and
their
background
strain
(
129
/
SV
)
.

Western
blot
analysis
was
used
to
determine
any
effect
of
DEC
on
the
production
of
COX
and
inducible
nitric
-
oxide
synthase
(
iNOS
)
proteins
.

RESULTS
:
DEC
administered
alone
to
BALB
/
c
mice
resulted
in
a
rapid
and
profound
reduction
in
circulating
microfilariae
within
five
minutes
of
treatment
.

Microfilarial
levels
began
to
recover
after
24
hours
and
returned
to
near
pre
-
treatment
levels
two
weeks
later
,
suggesting
that
the
sequestration
of
microfilariae
occurs
independently
of
parasite
killing
.

Pre
-
treatment
of
animals
with
dexamethasone
or
indomethacin
reduced
DEC
'
s
efficacy
by
almost
90
%
or
56
%
,
respectively
,
supporting
a
role
for
the
arachidonic
acid
and
cyclooxygenase
pathways
in
vivo
.

Furthermore
,
experiments
showed
that
treatment
with
DEC
results
in
a
reduction
in
the
amount
of
COX
-
1
protein
in
peritoneal
exudate
cells
.

Additionally
,
in
iNOS
-
/
-
mice
infected
with
B
.
malayi
microfilariae
,
DEC
showed
no
activity
,
whereas
the
efficacy
of
another
antifilarial
drug
,
ivermectin
,
was
unaffected
.

CONCLUSION
:
These
results
confirm
the
important
role
of
the
arachidonic
acid
metabolic
pathway
in
DEC
'
s
mechanism
of
action
in
vivo
and
show
that
in
addition
to
its
effects
on
the
5
-
lipoxygenase
pathway
,
it
targets
the
cyclooxygenase
pathway
and
COX
-
1
.

Moreover
,
we
show
for
the
first
time
that
inducible
nitric
oxide
is
essential
for
the
rapid
sequestration
of
microfilariae
by
DEC
.

Verapamil
prevents
torsade
de
pointes
by
reduction
of
transmural
dispersion
of
repolarization
and
suppression
of
early
afterdepolarizations
in
an
intact
heart
model
of
LQT3
.

BACKGROUND
:
In
long
QT
syndrome
(
LQTS
)
,
prolongation
of
the
QT
-
interval
is
associated
with
sudden
cardiac
death
resulting
from
potentially
life
-
threatening
polymorphic
tachycardia
of
the
torsade
de
pointes
(
TdP
)
type
.

Experimental
as
well
as
clinical
reports
support
the
hypothesis
that
calcium
channel
blockers
such
as
verapamil
may
be
an
appropriate
therapeutic
approach
in
LQTS
.

We
investigated
the
electrophysiologic
mechanism
by
which
verapamil
suppresses
TdP
,
in
a
recently
developed
intact
heart
model
of
LQT3
.

METHODS
AND
RESULTS
:
In
8
Langendorff
-
perfused
rabbit
hearts
,
veratridine
(
0
.
1
microM
)
,
an
inhibitor
of
sodium
channel
inactivation
,
led
to
a
marked
increase
in
QT
-
interval
and
simultaneously
recorded
monophasic
ventricular
action
potentials
(
MAPs
)
(
p
<
0
.
05
)
thereby
mimicking
LQT3
.

In
bradycardic
(
AV
-
blocked
)
hearts
,
simultaneous
recording
of
up
to
eight
epi
-
and
endocardial
MAPs
demonstrated
a
significant
increase
in
total
dispersion
of
repolarization
(
56
%
,
p
<
0
.
05
)
and
reverse
frequency
-
dependence
.

After
lowering
potassium
concentration
,
veratridine
reproducibly
led
to
early
afterdepolarizations
(
EADs
)
and
TdP
in
6
of
8
(
75
%
)
hearts
.

Additional
infusion
of
verapamil
(
0
.
75
microM
)
suppressed
EADs
and
consecutively
TdP
in
all
hearts
.

Verapamil
significantly
shortened
endocardial
but
not
epicardial
MAPs
which
resulted
in
significant
reduction
of
ventricular
transmural
dispersion
of
repolarization
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
Verapamil
is
highly
effective
in
preventing
TdP
via
shortening
of
endocardial
MAPs
,
reduction
of
left
ventricular
transmural
dispersion
of
repolarization
and
suppression
of
EADs
in
an
intact
heart
model
of
LQT3
.

These
data
suggest
a
possible
therapeutic
role
of
verapamil
in
the
treatment
of
LQT3
patients
.

[
Protein

vitamin
A
in
children
of
school

in
Ivory
Coast
]
.

The
purpose
of
this
transverse
prospective
study
was
to
determine
blood
nutritional
,
immunity
and
inflammatory
proteins
change
in
vitamin
A
deficiency
in
children
of
school
-
age
(
262
children
,
aged
7
to
15
years
)
.

Blood
vitamin
A
has
been
determined
by
HPLC
with
UV
detection
.

Proteins
have
been
measured
by
radial
immunodiffusion
according
to
Mancini
.

Results
showed
that
96
children
(
36

6
%
)
presented
a
vitamin
A
deficiency
(

)
.

This
study
showed
that
the
retinol
binding
protein
and
the
immunoglobulin
A
are
lower
in
children
with
vitamin
A
deficiency
.

On
the
other
hand
,
an
isolated
increase
of
alpha
-
1
glycoprotein
acid
has
been
observed
in
boys
with
vitamin
A
deficiency
.

The
vitamin
A
deficiency
observed
in
this
survey
is
due
to
a
micronutrients
deficiency
in
the
diet
which
is
essentially
based
on
glucides
.

The
positive
correlation
between
vitamin
A
and
immunoglobulin
A
concentrations
might
be
the
result
of
the
vitamin
A
inductive
effect
during
immunoglobulins
A
synthesis
.

The
isolated
increasing
of
alpha
-
1
glycoprotein
acid
in
boys
with
vitamin
A
deficiency
has
been
assigned
to
the
ecosensitiveness
of
the
unfavourable
environment
.

We
therefore
concluded
that
,
in
Ivorian
primary
-
school
-
aged
children
with
vitamin
A
deficiency
,
nutritional
,
immunity
and
inflammatory
proteins
which
are
modified
are
respectively
retinol
binding
protein
,
immunoglobulin
A
and
alpha
-
1
glycoprotein
acid
.

Monocarboxylate
transporters
in
the
central
nervous
system
:
distribution
,
regulation
and
function
.

Monocarboxylate
transporters
(
MCTs
)
are
proton
-
linked
membrane
carriers
involved
in
the
transport
of
monocarboxylates
such
as
lactate
,
pyruvate
,
as
well
as
ketone
bodies
.

They
belong
to
a
larger
family
of
transporters
composed
of
14
members
in
mammals
based
on
sequence
homologies
.

MCTs
are
found
in
various
tissues
including
the
brain
where
three
isoforms
,
MCT1
,
MCT2
and
MCT4
,
have
been
described
.

Each
of
these
isoforms
exhibits
a
distinct
regional
and
cellular
distribution
in
rodent
brain
.

At
the
cellular
level
,
MCT1
is
expressed
by
endothelial
cells
of
microvessels
,
by
ependymocytes
as
well
as
by
astrocytes
.

MCT4
expression
appears
to
be
specific
for
astrocytes
.

By
contrast
,
the
predominant
neuronal
monocarboxylate
transporter
is
MCT2
.

Interestingly
,
part
of
MCT2
immunoreactivity
is
located
at
postsynaptic
sites
,
suggesting
a
particular
role
of
monocarboxylates
and
their
transporters
in
synaptic
transmission
.

In
addition
to
variation
in
expression
during
development
and
upon
nutritional
modifications
,
new
data
indicate
that
MCT
expression
is
regulated
at
the
translational
level
by
neurotransmitters
.

Understanding
how
transport
of
monocarboxylates
is
regulated
could
be
of
particular
importance
not
only
for
neuroenergetics
but
also
for
areas
such
as
functional
brain
imaging
,
regulation
of
food
intake
and
glucose
homeostasis
,
or
for
central
nervous
system
disorders
such
as
ischaemia
and
neurodegenerative
diseases
.

The
platelet
P2
receptors
as
molecular
targets
for
old
and
new
antiplatelet
drugs
.

Platelet
activation
by
ADP
and
ATP
plays
a
crucial
role
in
haemostasis
and
thrombosis
,
and
their
so
-
called
P2
receptors
are
potential
targets
for
antithrombotic
drugs
.

The
ATP
-
gated
channel
P2X1
and
the
2
G
protein
-
coupled
P2Y1
and
P2Y12
ADP
receptors
selectively
contribute
to
platelet
aggregation
.

The
P2Y1
receptor
is
responsible
for
ADP
-
induced
shape
change
and
weak
and
transient
aggregation
,
while
the
P2Y12
receptor
is
responsible
for
the
completion
and
amplification
of
the
response
to
ADP
and
to
all
platelet
agonists
,
including
thromboxane
A2
(
TXA2
)
,
thrombin
,
and
collagen
.

The
P2X1
receptor
is
involved
in
platelet
shape
change
and
in
activation
by
collagen
under
shear
conditions
.

Due
to
its
central
role
in
the
formation
and
stabilization
of
a
thrombus
,
the
P2Y12
receptor
is
a
well
-
established
target
of
antithrombotic
drugs
like
ticlopidine
or
clopidogrel
,
which
have
proved
efficacy
in
many
clinical
trials
and
experimental
models
of
thrombosis
.

Competitive
P2Y12
antagonists
have
also
been
shown
to
be
effective
in
experimental
thrombosis
as
well
as
in
several
clinical
trials
.

Studies
in
P2Y1
and
P2X1
knockout
mice
and
experimental
thrombosis
models
using
selective
P2Y1
and
P2X1
antagonists
have
shown
that
,
depending
on
the
conditions
,
these
receptors
could
also
be
potential
targets
for
new
antithrombotic
drugs
.

Improving
the
tolerability
of
anticholinergic
agents
in
the
treatment
of
overactive
bladder
.

Pharmacological
treatment
for
overactive
bladder
has
centred
around
the
interruption
of
the
detrusor
activity
that
is
central
to
urge
and
incontinence
symptoms
.

The
majority
of
patients
with
this
disorder
are
treated
with
antimuscarinic
agents
.

These
drugs
have
been
demonstrated
to
improve
urgency
,
frequency
of
micturition
and
urge
incontinence
,
all
of
which
are
primary
symptoms
of
overactive
bladder
;
however
,
they
are
also
commonly
associated
with
anticholinergic
adverse
effects
,
most
notably
dry
mouth
.

Attempts
to
increase
tolerability
have
included
the
development
of
advanced
formulations
that
regulate
release
of
the
active
ingredient
and
the
development
of
pharmacological
agents
that
target
the
desired
bladder
receptors
more
specifically
and
accurately
.

Although
all
agents
provide
good
efficacy
,
tolerability
is
greatly
affected
by
the
formulation
used
to
deliver
the
active
pharmacological
agent
,
as
well
as
the
specificity
of
the
targeted
receptors
.

Clinical
trials
involving
a
transdermal
formulation
of
oxybutynin
have
shown
that
this
delivery
method
may
be
associated
with
a
lower
incidence
of
anticholinergic
adverse
events
compared
with
both
the
immediate
-
release
and
the
extended
-
release
oral
formulations
of
traditional
agents
,
as
well
as
the
most
recently
approved
agents
-
trospium
chloride
,
solifenacin
and
darifenacin
.

Much
is
still
being
learned
about
the
function
and
specificity
of
muscarinic
receptors
,
which
will
support
the
development
of
agents
with
sustained
efficacy
and
enhanced
tolerability
compared
with
the
available
formulations
to
date
.

These
include
the
S
-
isomer
of
oxybutynin
,
as
well
as
selective
muscarinic
M2
receptor
antagonists
.

Effect
of
thiazolidinediones
on
equilibrative
nucleoside
transporter
-
1
in
human
aortic
smooth
muscle
cells
.

Thiazolidinediones
are
a
new
class
of
anti
-
diabetic
agents
which
increase
insulin
sensitivity
by
binding
to
the
peroxisome
proliferator
-
activated
receptor
gamma
(
PPAR
(
gamma
)
)
and
stimulating
the
expression
of
insulin
-
responsive
genes
involved
in
glucose
and
lipid
metabolism
.

These
drugs
also
have
vasodilatory
and
anti
-
proliferative
effects
on
vascular
smooth
muscle
cells
.

However
the
mechanisms
for
these
actions
are
not
fully
understood
.

Adenosine
is
a
vasodilator
and
a
substrate
of
equilibrative
nucleoside
transporters
(
ENT
)
.

The
present
study
studied
the
effects
of
three
thiazolidinediones
,
troglitazone
,
pioglitazone
and
ciglitazone
,
on
ENT1
in
the
human
aortic
smooth
muscle
cells
(
HASMCs
)
.

Although
incubating
HASMCs
for
48h
with
thiazolidinediones
had
no
effect
on
ENT1
mRNA
and
protein
levels
,
troglitazone
acutely
inhibited
[
3H
]
adenosine
uptake
and
[
3H
]
NBMPR
binding
of
HASMCs
with
IC50
values
of

/

and

.

57microM
,
respectively
.

The
effect
of
troglitazone
on
ENT1
was
PPAR
(
gamma
)
-
independent
and
kinetic
studies
revealed
that
troglitazone
was
a
competitive
inhibitor
of
ENT1
.

In
contrast
,
pioglitazone
and
ciglitazone
had
minimal
effects
on
[
3H
]
adenosine
uptake
by
HASMCs
.

Troglitazone
differs
from
pioglitazone
and
ciglitazone
in
that
its
side
-
chain
contains
a
Vitamin
E
moiety
.

The
difference
in
structure
of
troglitazone
did
not
account
for
its
inhibitory
effect
on
ENT1
because
Vitamin
E
did
not
inhibit
[
3H
]
adenosine
uptake
by
HASMCs
.

Using
the
nucleoside
transporter
deficient
PK15NTD
cells
stably
expressing
ENT1
and
ENT2
,
it
was
found
that
troglitazone
inhibited
ENT1
but
had
no
effect
on
ENT2
.

From
these
results
,
it
is
suggested
that
troglitazone
may
enhance
the
vasodilatory
effect
of
adenosine
by
inhibiting
ENT1
.

Pharmacologically
,
troglitazone
is
a
novel
inhibitor
of
ENT1
.

plays
a
major
role
in
the
activation
and
recruitment
of
polymorphonuclear

We
report
here
molecular

showing
a

in
the

region
of
CXCR1
.

The

was
confirmed
by

.

The

of

led
to
a

class
of
potent

of

Among
these
,

Thalidomide
inhibits
growth
of
tumors
through
COX
-

degradation
independent
of
antiangiogenesis
.

Thalidomide
is
an
antiangiogenic
drug
and
is
clinically
useful
in
a
number
of
cancers
.

However
,
the
molecular
mechanism
by
which
thalidomide
exerts
its
antitumor
effects
is
poorly
understood
.

This
study
was
designed
to
clarify
the
relationship
between
antiangiogenesis
and
antitumor
effects
of
thalidomide
and
to
explore
the
molecular
mechanism
for
its
antitumor
activity
.

We
evaluated
the
effects
of
thalidomide
on
the
growth
of
human
tumor
cells
expressing
(
MCF

and
HL
-

)
or
not
expressing
(
HeLa

)
COX

in

.

We
also
studied
the
effects
of
thalidomide
on

,
TNFalpha

Thalidomide
could
inhibit

in
a
concentration

in
MCF

;

,
while

Thalidomide
reduced

expression
accompanied
by
a
decrease
of
bcl

protein
,
TNFalpha
,
VEGF
,

and
an

but
had
no

on
that
of

Moreover
,
cells
not

were
insensitive
to
the

Duloxetine
hydrochloride
:
a
new
dual
-
acting
medication
for
the
treatment
of
major
depressive
disorder
.

BACKGROUND
:
Duloxetine
hydrochloride
has
recently
been
approved
by
the
US
Food
and
Drug
Administration
for
the
treatment
of
major
depressive
disorder
(
MDD
)
.

Duloxetine
is
a
potent
inhibitor
of
serotonin
and
norepinephrine
reuptake
,
with
weak
effects
on
dopamine
reuptake
.

OBJECTIVE
:
This
article
reviews
the
literature
on
duloxetine
with
regard
to
its
pharmacodynamics
,
pharmacokinetics
,
clinical
efficacy
,
and
tolerability
.

METHODS
:
A
comprehensive
search
of
MEDLINE
was
performed
using
the
terms
duloxetine
,
Cymbalta
,
and
major
depressive
disorder
,
with
no
restriction
on
year
.

The
Eli
Lilly
and
Company
clinical
trial
registry
,
and
abstracts
and
posters
from
recent
American
Psychiatric
Association
meetings
were
also
reviewed
.

RESULTS
:
Duloxetine
exhibits
linear
,
dose
-
dependent
pharmacokinetics
across
the
approved
oral
dosage
range
of
40
to
60
mg
/
d
.

No
dose
adjustment
appears
to
be
needed
based
on
age
.

Duloxetine
has
shown
efficacy
in
reducing
depressive
symptoms
compared
with
placebo
,
and
duloxetine
recipients
have
shown
significant
improvements
in
global
functioning
compared
with
placebo
(
both
,
P
<
0
.
05
)
.

Response
and
remission
rates
have
been
comparable
to
or
greater
than
those
seen
with
fluoxetine
or
paroxetine
.

Duloxetine
is
generally
well
tolerated
,
with
nausea
,
dry
mouth
,
and
fatigue
being
the
most
common
treatment
-
emergent
adverse
effects
.

Cardiovascular
adverse
effects
do
not
appear
to
result
in
sustained
blood
pressure
elevations
,
QTc
-
interval
prolongation
,
or
other
electrocardiographic
changes
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
Based
on
the
available
evidence
,
duloxetine
is
a
well
-
tolerated
and
effective
treatment
for
MDD
in
adults
.

Randomized
head
-
to
-
head
comparisons
against
established
antidepressants
are
needed
to
determine
the
relative
safety
and
efficacy
of
duloxetine
.

In
vivo
comparison
of
the
reinforcing
and
dopamine
transporter
effects
of
local
anesthetics
in
rhesus
monkeys
.

Dopaminergic
mechanisms
are
thought
to
play
a
central
role
in
the
reinforcing
effects
of
cocaine
.

Similar
to
cocaine
,
other
local
anesthetics
bind
to
the
dopamine
transporter
(
DAT
)
and
inhibit
DA
uptake
in
rodent
and
monkey
brain
.

Additionally
,
local
anesthetics
are
self
-
administered
in
rhesus
monkeys
,
indicative
of
abuse
liability
.

The
present
study
examined
the
reinforcing
and
DAT
effects
of
the
local
anesthetics
dimethocaine
,
procaine
and
cocaine
using
in
vivo
techniques
.

Monkeys
were
trained
to
respond
under
a
second
-
order
schedule
for
i
.
v
.
cocaine
administration
(
0
.
10
or
0
.
30
mg
/
kg
/
infusion
)
.

When
responding
was
stable
,
dimethocaine
(
0
.
030
-
1
.
7
mg
/
kg
/
infusion
)
or
procaine
(
0
.
10
-
10
mg
/
kg
/
infusion
)
was
substituted
for
the
cocaine
training
dose
.

Dimethocaine
administration
produced
higher
response
rates
compared
with
that
of
procaine
,
and
was
a
more
potent
reinforcer
.

Drug
effects
on
behavior
were
related
to
DAT
occupancy
in
monkey
striatum
during
neuroimaging
with
positron
emission
tomography
(
PET
)
.

DAT
occupancy
was
determined
by
displacement
of
8
-
(
2
-
[
(
18
)
F
]
fluroethyl
)
2beta
-
carbomethoxy
-
3beta
-
(
4
-
chlorophenyl
)
nortropane
(
FECNT
)
.

DAT
occupancy
was
between
66
and
82
%
and
<
10
-
41
%
for
doses
of
dimethocaine
and
procaine
that
maintained
maximum
response
rates
,
respectively
.

Finally
,
in
vivo
microdialysis
in
awake
subjects
determined
drug
-
induced
changes
in
extracellular
DA
in
the
caudate
nucleus
.

There
was
close
correspondence
between
peak
increases
in
DA
and
DAT
occupancy
.

Overall
,
reinforcing
effects
were
consistent
with
DAT
effects
determined
with
in
vivo
techniques
.

The
results
further
support
a
role
for
the
DAT
in
the
abuse
liability
of
local
anesthetics
.

investigated
in
recombinant
human
UGT1A9
using
4

)
as
a
substrate
for

.

The
inhibitory
effects
of
the
following
seven
NSAIDs
were
investigated
:
acetaminophen
,
diclofenac
,
diflunisal
,
indomethacin
,
ketoprofen
,
naproxen
and
niflumic
acid
.

Niflumic
acid
had
the
most
potent
inhibitory
effect
on
4
-
MUG
with
an
IC50
value
of
0
.
0341
microM
.

The
IC50
values
of
diflunisal
,
diclofenac
and
indomethacin
were
1
.
31
,
24
.
2
,
and
34
.
1
microM
,
respectively
,
while
acetaminophen
,
ketoprofen
and
naproxen
showed
less
potent
inhibition
.

Niflumic
acid
,
diflunisal
,
diclofenac
and
indomethacin
inhibited
4

MUG
competitively
with
Ki
values
of
0

710
,
53
.
3
and
69

microM
,
respectively
,
being
similar
to
each
IC50
value
.

In
conclusion
,
of
the
seven
NSAIDs
investigated
,
niflumic
acid
was
the
most
potent
inhibitor
of
recombinant
UGT1A9
via
4

Spectrum
of
mutations
in
mut
methylmalonic
acidemia
and
identification
of
a
common
Hispanic
mutation
and
haplotype
.

Cobalamin
nonresponsive
methylmalonic
acidemia
(
MMA
,
mut
complementation
class
)
results
from
mutations
in
the
nuclear
gene
MUT
,
which
codes
for
the
mitochondrial
enzyme
methylmalonyl
CoA
mutase
(
MCM
)
.

To
better
elucidate
the
spectrum
of
mutations
that
cause
MMA
,
the
MUT
gene
was
sequenced
in
160
patients
with
mut
MMA
.

Sequence
analysis
identified
mutations
in
96
%
of
disease
alleles
.

Mutations
were
found
in
all
coding
exons
,
but
predominantly
in
exons
2
,
3
,
6
,
and
11
.

A
total
of
116
different
mutations
,
68
of
which
were
novel
,
were
identified
.

Of
the
116
different
mutations
,
53
%
were
missense
mutations
,
22
%
were
deletions
,
duplications
or
insertions
,
16
%
were
nonsense
mutations
,
and
9
%
were
splice
-
site
mutations
.

Sixty
-
one
of
the
mutations
have
only
been
identified
in
one
family
.

A
novel
mutation
in
exon
2
,
c
.
322C
>
T
(
p
.
R108C
)
,
was
identified
in
16
of
27
Hispanic
patients
.

SNP
genotyping
data
demonstrated
that
Hispanic
patients
with
this
mutation
share
a
common
haplotype
.

Three
other
mutations
were
seen
exclusively
in
Hispanic
patients
:
c
.
280G
>
A
(
p

G94R
)
,
c
.
1022dupA
,
and
c
.
970G
>
A
(
p
.
A324T
)
.

Seven
mutations
were
seen
almost
exclusively
in
black
patients
,
including
the
previously
reported
c
.
2150G
>
T
(
p
.
G717V
)
mutation
,
which
was
identified
in
12
of
29
black
patients
.

Two
mutations
were
seen
only
in
Asian
patients
.

Some
frequently
identified
mutations
were
not
population
-
specific
and
were
identified
in
patients
of
various
ethnic
backgrounds
.

Some
of
these
mutations
were
found
in
mutation
clusters
in
exons
2
,
3
,
6
,
and
11
,
suggesting
a
recurrent
mutation
.

New
progestagens
for
contraceptive
use
.

The
progestins
have
different
pharmacologic
properties
depending
upon
the
parent
molecule
,
usually
testosterone
or
progesterone
(
P
)
,
from
which
they
are
derived
.

Very
small
structural
changes
in
the
parent
molecule
may
induce
considerable
differences
in
the
activity
of
the
derivative
.

In
hormonal
contraceptives
,
progestins
represent
the
major
agent
designed
for
suppressing
ovulation
and
are
used
in
combination
with
estrogen
(
E
)
usually
ethinyl
-
estradiol
(
EE
)
.

The
development
of
new
generations
of
progestins
with
improved
selectivity
profiles
has
been
a
great
challenge
.

Steroidal
and
nonsteroidal
progesterone
receptor
(
PR
)
agonists
have
been
synthesized
as
well
,
although
the
latter
are
still
in
a
very
early
stage
of
development
.

Several
new
progestins
,
have
been
synthesized
in
the
last
two
decades
.

These
include
dienogest
(
DNG
)
,
drospirenone
(
DRSP
)
,
Nestorone
(
NES
)
,
nomegestrol
acetate
(
NOMAc
)
and
trimegestone
(
TMG
)
.

These
new
progestins
have
been
designed
to
have
no
androgenic
or
estrogenic
actions
and
to
be
closer
in
activity
to
the
physiological
hormone
P
.

DRSP
differs
from
the
classic
progestins
as
it
is
derived
from
spirolactone
.

It
is
essentially
an
antimineralocorticoid
steroid
with
no
androgenic
effect
but
a
partial
antiandrogenic
effect
.

The
antiovulatory
potency
of
the
different
progestins
varies
.

TMG
and
NES
are
the
most
potent
progestins
synthesized
to
date
,
followed
by
two
of
the
older
progestins
,
keto
-
desogestrel
(
keto
-
DSG
)
and
levonorgestrel
(
LNG
)
.

The
new
molecules
TMG
,
DRSP
and
DNG
also
have
antiandrogenic
activity
.

Striking
differences
exist
regarding
the
side
effects
among
the
progestins
and
the
combination
with
EE
leads
to
other
reactions
related
to
the
E
itself
and
whether
the
associated
progestin
counterbalances
,
more
or
less
,
the
estrogenic
action
.

The
19
-
norprogesterone
molecules
and
the
new
molecules
DRSP
and
DNG
are
not
androgenic
and
,
therefore
,
have
no
negative
effect
on
the
lipid
profile
.

Given
their
pharmacological
properties
,
it
is
likely
that
the
new
progestins
may
have
neutral
effects
on
metabolic
or
vascular
risks
.

However
,
this
hypothesis
must
be
confirmed
in
large
clinical
trials
.

Drug
binding

in
the
inner
cavity
of
HERG
channels
:
molecular
insights
from
structure
-
activity
relationships
of
clofilium
and
ibutilide
analogs
.

)
K
(

)
channels
by
otherwise
useful
drugs
is
the
most
common
cause
of
long
QT
syndrome
,
a
disorder
of
cardiac
repolarization
that
predisposes
patients
to
potentially
fatal
arrhythmias
.

This
undesirable
long
QT
side
effect
has
been
a
major
reason
for
the
withdrawal
of
medications
from
the
pharmaceutical
market
.

Understanding
the
molecular
basis
of
hERG
block
is
therefore
essential
to
facilitate
the
design
of
safe
drugs
.

Binding
sites
for
hERG
blockers
have
been
mapped
within
the
inner
cavity
of
the
channel
and
include
aromatic
residues
in
the
S6
helix
(
Tyr
-
652
,
Phe
-
656
)
and
residues
in
the
pore
helix
(
Thr
-
623
,
Ser
-
624
,
Val
-
625
)
.

We
used
mutagenesis
of
these
residues
,
combined
with
an
investigation
of
hERG
block
by
close
analogs
of
clofilium
and
ibutilide
,
to
assess
how
specific
alterations
in
drug
structure
affected
potency
and
binding
interactions
.

Although
changing
the
basic
nitrogen
from
quaternary
to
tertiary
accelerated
the
onset
of
block
,
the
IC
(
50
)
and
kinetics
for
recovery
from
block
were
similar
.

In
contrast
,
analogs
with
different
para
-
substituents
on
the
phenyl
ring
had
significantly
different
potencies
for
wild
-
type
hERG
block
.

The
highest
potency
was
achieved
with
polar
or
electronegative
para
-
substituents
,
whereas
neutral
para
-
substituents
had
potencies
more
than
100
-
fold
lower
.

Results
from
mutagenesis
and
molecular
modeling
studies
suggest
that
phenyl
ring
para
-
substituents
influence
drug
interactions
with
Thr
-
623
,
Ser
-
624
,
and
Tyr
-
652
and
strongly
affect
binding
affinity
.

Together
,
these
findings
suggest
that
modifying
the
para
-
substituent
could
be
a
useful
strategy
for
reducing
hERG
potency
and
increasing
the
safety
margin
of
compounds
in
development
.

Effect

]
-

-
MSH
,
on

in
humans
with
MC1R
variant
alleles
.

MELANOTAN
(
NDP
-
MSH
)
binds
the
MC1
receptor
to
significantly
increase
the
eumelanin
content
of
human
skin
cells
.

In
this
study
of
77
Caucasian
individuals
,
we
investigated
the
effects
of
MELANOTAN
in
individuals
with
variant
MC1R
genotypes
,
as
it
has
been
suggested
through
in
vitro
studies
that
variant
alleles
decrease
MELANOTAN
binding
efficacy
,
which
would
subsequently
affect
the
synthesis
of
melanin
.

Administration
of
MELANOTAN
produced
a
significant
(
p
<
0
.
001
)
increase
in
melanin
density
in
treated
,
compared
to
placebo
,
individuals
.

Importantly
,
MELANOTAN
increased
the
melanin
density
to
a
greater
extent
in
individuals
carrying
the
variant
alleles
Val60Leu
,
Asp84Glu
,
Val92Met
,
Arg142His
,
Arg151Cys
,
and
Arg160Trp
than
in
individuals
with
no
variant
alleles
.

This
study
demonstrates
that
MELANOTAN
effectively
increases
the
melanin
content
of
skin
in
those
individuals
with
MC1R
variant
alleles
and
therefore
,
those
most
in
need
of
photoprotection
.

Tissue

Tissue

type
plasminogen
activator
(
tPA
)
,
a
serine
protease
well
known
for
generating
plasmin
,
has
been
demonstrated
to
induce
matrix
metalloproteinase

(
MMP

)
gene
expression
and
protein
secretion
in
renal
interstitial
fibroblasts
.

However
,
exactly
how
tPA
transduces
its
signal
into
the
nucleus
to
control
gene
expression
is
unknown
.

This
study
investigated
the
mechanism
by
which
tPA
induces
MMP
-
9
gene
expression
.

Both
wild
-
type
and
non

enzymatic
mutant
tPA
were
found
to
induce
MMP
-
9
expression
in
rat
kidney
interstitial
fibroblasts
(
NRK
-
49F
)
,
indicating
that
the
actions
of
tPA
are
independent
of
its
proteolytic
activity
.

tPA
bound
to
the
low
density
lipoprotein
receptor
-
related
protein
-
1
(
LRP
-
1
)
in
NRK
-
49F
cells
,
and
this
binding
was
competitively
abrogated
by
the
LRP
-

antagonist
,
the
receptor
-
associated
protein
.

In
mouse
embryonic
fibroblasts
(
PEA
-
13
)
lacking
LRP
-
1
,
tPA
failed
to
induce
MMP
-
9
expression
.

Furthermore
,
tPA
induced
rapid
tyrosine
phosphorylation
on
the
beta
subunit
of
LRP
-

,
which
was
followed
by
the
activation
of

were
concomitantly
induced
in
the

Collectively
,
these
results
suggest
that
besides
its
classical
proteolytic

,
tPA
acts
as
a
cytokine
that
binds
to
the
cell

Despite

continued

In

we
utilized

to

how
the

is

by
the

even
in

Collectively
,
these

provide

that

involves
stabilization
of

elucidation
of

The

that
are
responsible
for
global
adverse
human
health
effects
and
wildlife

in

.

The
toxins
function
by
inhibiting

phosphatases
in
the
host
cells
,
thereby
disrupting
signal

.

A

We
have
elucidated

The

Selective
costimulation
modulators
:
a
novel
approach
for
the
treatment
of
rheumatoid
arthritis
.

T
cells
have
a
central
role
in
the
orchestration
of
the
immune
pathways
that
contribute
to
the
inflammation
and
joint
destruction
characteristic
of
rheumatoid
arthritis
(
RA
)
.

The
requirement
for
a
dual
signal
for
T
-
cell
activation
and
the
construction
of
a
fusion
protein
that
prevents
engagement
of
the
costimulatory
molecules
required
for
this
activation
has
led
to
a
new
approach
to
RA
therapy
.

This
approach
is
mechanistically
distinct
from
other
currently
used
therapies
;
it
targets
events
early
rather
than
late
in
the
immune
cascade
,
and
it
results
in
immunomodulation
rather
than
complete
immunosuppression
.

The
fusion
protein
abatacept
is
a
selective
costimulation
modulator
that
avidly
binds
to
the
CD80
/
CD86
ligands
on
an
antigen
-
presenting
cell
,
resulting
in
the
inability
of
these
ligands
to
engage
the
CD28
receptor
on
the
T
cell
.

Abatacept
dose
-
dependently
reduces
T
-
cell
proliferation
,
serum
concentrations
of
acute
-
phase
reactants
,
and
other
markers
of
inflammation
,
including
the
production
of
rheumatoid
factor
by
B
cells
.

Recent
studies
have
provided
consistent
evidence
that
treatment
with
abatacept
results
in
a
rapid
onset
of
efficacy
that
is
maintained
over
the
course
of
treatment
in
patients
with
inadequate
response
to
methotrexate
and
anti
-
tumor
necrosis
factor
therapies
.

This
efficacy
includes
patient
-
centered
outcomes
and
radiographic
measurement
of
disease
progression
.

Abatacept
has
also
demonstrated
a
very
favorable
safety
profile
to
date
.

This
article
reviews
the
rationale
for
this
therapeutic
approach
and
highlights
some
of
the
recent
studies
that
demonstrate
the
benefits
obtained
by
using
abatacept
.

This
clinical
experience
indicates
that
abatacept
is
a
significant
addition
to
the
therapeutic
armamentarium
for
the
management
of
patients
with
RA
.

Identification
of
the
regulatory
region
of
the
L

type
pyruvate
kinase
gene
in
mouse
liver
by
hydrodynamics
-
based
gene

.

Expression
of
L
-
type
pyruvate
kinase
(
L
-
PK
)
is
upregulated
in
the
liver
by
dietary
carbohydrate
.

Previously
,
3
carbohydrate
/
insulin
response
elements
were
identified
in
the
5
'
-
flanking
region
of
the
L
-
PK
gene
up
to
bp
-
170
.

Studies
of
the
5
'
-
flanking
region
beyond
bp
-
183
in
transgenic
mice
suggested
that
other
regulatory
elements
may
be
present
upstream
of
bp
-
183
,
but
the
positions
of
these
elements
were
uncertain
.

In
the
present
study
,
the
existence
of
regulatory
regions
of
the
L
-
PK
gene
responding
to
stimulation
by
feeding
was
examined
using
in

hydrodynamics

gene
transfection
(
HT
)
in
mouse
liver
.

The
firefly

luciferase
(
FL
)
gene
,
fused
with
various
lengths
of
the
5
'
-
flanking
region
of
the
L
-
PK
gene
,
was
introduced
into
mouse
liver
by
HT
.

The
mice
had
free
access
to
a
high

carbohydrate
diet
.

In
liver
homogenate
,
luciferase

of
pL

PK
(

)
-
FL
(
which
included
the
5
'
-
flanking
region
from
bp
-
1467
to
+
17
)
,
was
markedly
stimulated
by
feeding
.

5
'
-
Deletion
up
to
bp
-
1065
caused
only
minor
changes
in
luciferase
activity
,
but
further
deletion
up
to
bp
-
690
and
bp
-
203
caused
significant
,
gradual
decreases
in
activity
.

Further
analyses
utilizing
5
'
-
deletion
mutants
indicated
the
existence
of
positive
regulatory
regions
that
respond
to
stimulation
by
feeding
between
bp
-
1065
and
-
945
,
and
between
-
300
and
-
203
on
the
L
-
PK
gene
.

These
results
suggest
that
unidentified
cis
-
acting
DNA
elements
exist
in
the
upstream
region
of
the
L
-
PK
gene
,
and
that
HT
is
a
useful
approach
for
detecting
regulatory
regions
of
genes
expressed
in
the
liver
.

In

using

.

Our
results
have
shown
that
MMP

was
inhibited
by
doxycycline
starting
at
10
mg

(

.

Minocycline
showed

,
starting
at

and
further
at

At

doxycycline
started
to

at
5
mg

at

(
P

.

The
inhibition
of
cerebral
MMP

mRNA
and
activity
were
highly
correlated
with
drug
levels
in
the
brain

.

We
also
assessed
the
potential
relevant

pathway
in

to
elucidate
the
mechanisms
underlying
the
MMP

by
tetracyclines
.

In

,
minocycline
,
but
not
doxycycline
,
inhibits

,
at

,
via
the
extracellular

.

This
study
provided
the
evidence
that
the
tetracyclines
inhibit
stimulated

at
multiple
levels
and
are
effective
at
very
low

Characterization
of
the
omega
class
of
glutathione
transferases
.

The
Omega
class
of
cytosolic
glutathione
transferases
was
initially
recognized
by
bioinformatic
analysis
of
human
sequence
databases
,
and
orthologous
sequences
were
subsequently
discovered
in
mouse
,
rat
,
pig
,
Caenorhabditis
elegans
,
Schistosoma
mansoni
,
and
Drosophila
melanogaster
.

In
humans
and
mice
,
two
GSTO
genes
have
been
recognized
and
their
genetic
structures
and
expression
patterns
identified
.

In
both
species
,
GSTO1
mRNA
is
expressed
in
liver
and
heart
as
well
as
a
range
of
other
tissues
.

GSTO2
is
expressed
predominantly
in
the
testis
,
although
moderate
levels
of
expression
are
seen
in
other
tissues
.

Extensive
immunohistochemistry
of
rat
and
human
tissue
sections
has
demonstrated
cellular
and
subcellular
specificity
in
the
expression
of
GSTO1
-
1
.

The
crystal
structure
of
recombinant
human
GSTO1
-
1
has
been
determined
,
and
it
adopts
the
canonical
GST
fold
.

A
cysteine
residue
in
place
of
the
catalytic
tyrosine
or
serine
residues
found
in
other
GSTs
was
shown
to
form
a
mixed
disulfide
with
glutathione
.

Omega
class
GSTs
have
dehydroascorbate
reductase
and
thioltransferase
activities
and
also
catalyze
the
reduction
of
monomethylarsonate
,
an
intermediate
in
the
pathway
of
arsenic
biotransformation
.

Other
diverse
actions
of
human
GSTO1
-
1
include
modulation
of
ryanodine
receptors
and
interaction
with
cytokine
release
inhibitory
drugs
.

In
addition
,
GSTO1
has
been
linked
to
the
age
at
onset
of
both
Alzheimer
'
s
and
Parkinson
'
s
diseases
.

Several
polymorphisms
have
been
identified
in
the
coding
regions
of
the
human
GSTO1
and
GSTO2
genes
.

Our
laboratory
has
expressed
recombinant
human
GSTO1

and
GSTO2

2
proteins
,
as
well
as
a
number
of

of
these

The
neuropeptide
galanin
has
been
shown
to
attenuate

The
current
study
demonstrates
that

blocks
the
consequences
of
increased

Dose

were
constructed
based
on

Formoterol
was
more

with
a
significantly

The

that

.

This
mutation
is
inherently
resistant
to
imatinib
and
,
to

,
there
remains
no
effective

for

associated
with

.

Dasatinib
(
BMS
-
354825
)
is
a
novel
orally
bioavailable
SRC
/
ABL
inhibitor
that
has
activity
against
multiple
imatinib
-
resistant
BCR
-
ABL
isoforms
in
vitro
that
is
presently
showing
considerable
promise
in
early
-
phase
clinical
trials
of
chronic
myeloid
leukemia
(
CML
)
.

Pharmacokinetic
analysis
suggests
that
high
nanomolar
concentrations
of
dasatinib
can
be
achieved
safely
in
humans
.

In
this
study
,
we
demonstrate
significant
inhibitory
activity
of
dasatinib
against
both
wild
-
type
KIT
and
the
KITD816V
mutation
in
the
nanomolar
range
in
in
vitro
and
cell
-
based
kinase
assays
.

Additionally
,
dasatinib
leads
to
growth
inhibition
of
a
KITD816V
-
harboring
human
masto
-
cytosis
cell
line
.

Significantly
,
dasatinib
selectively
kills
primary
neoplastic
bone
marrow
mast
cells
from
patients
with
systemic
mastocytosis
while
sparing
other
hematopoietic
cells
.

Computer
modeling
suggests
that
the
KITD816V
mutation
destabilizes
the
inactive
conformation
of
the
KIT
activation
loop
to
which
imatinib
binds
,
but
it
is
not
predicted
to
impair
binding
of
KIT
by
dasatinib
.

Based
upon
our
results
,
further
evaluation
of
dasatinib
for
the
treatment
of
systemic
masto
-
cytosis
in
clinical
trials
is
warranted
.

Moreover
,
dasatinib
may
be
of
clinical
utility
in
other
disease
settings
driven
by
activating
KIT
mutations
.

Cholinesterase
inhibitors
for
Alzheimer
'
s
disease
.

BACKGROUND
:
Since
the
introduction
of
the
first
cholinesterase
inhibitor
(
ChEI
)
in
1997
,
most
clinicians
and
probably
most
patients
would
consider
the
cholinergic
drugs
,
donepezil
,
galantamine
and
rivastigmine
,
to
be
the
first
line
pharmacotherapy
for
mild
to
moderate
Alzheimer
'
s
disease
.
The
drugs
have
slightly
different
pharmacological
properties
,
but
they
all
work
by
inhibiting
the
breakdown
of
acetylcholine
,
an
important
neurotransmitter
associated
with
memory
,
by
blocking
the
enzyme
acetylcholinesterase
.

The
most
that
these
drugs
could
achieve
is
to
modify
the
manifestations
of
Alzheimer
'
s
disease
.

Cochrane
reviews
of
each
ChEI
for
Alzheimer
'
s
disease
have
been
completed
(
Birks
2005
,
Birks
2005b
and
Loy
2005
)
.

Despite
the
evidence
from
the
clinical
studies
and
the
intervening
clinical
experience
the
debate
on
whether
ChEIs
are
effective
continues
.

OBJECTIVES
:
To

of

SELECTION
CRITERIA
:
All
unconfounded

in
which
treatment
with
a

or
another
ChEI

DATA
COLLECTION
AND
ANALYSIS
:
Data
were
extracted
by
one
reviewer
(

,
pooled
where
appropriate
and
possible
,
and
the
pooled

:
The
results
of
13
randomized

demonstrate
that

for
periods
of
6
months

Study
clinicians

more
positively
in
treated
patients
.

Benefits
of
treatment
were
also
seen
on
measures
of
activities
of
daily
living
and
behaviour
.

None
of
these
treatment
effects
are
large
.

There
is
nothing
to
suggest
the
effects
are
less
for
patients
with
severe
dementia
or
mild
dementia
,
although
there
is
very
little
evidence
for
other
than
mild
to
moderate
dementia
.
More
patients
leave
ChEI

groups
,
approximately
29
%
,
on
account
of
adverse
events
than
leave
the
placebo
groups
(
18
%
)
.

There
is
evidence
of
more
adverse
events
in
total
in
the
patients
treated
with
a
ChEI
than
with
placebo
.

Although
many
types
of
adverse
event
were
reported
,
nausea
,
vomiting
,
diarrhoea
,
were
significantly
more
frequent
in
the
ChEI
groups
than
in
placebo
.

There
are
four
studies
,
all
supported
by
one
of
the
pharmaceutical
companies
,
in
which
two
ChEIs
were
compared
,
two
studies
of
donepezil
compared
with
galantamine
,
and
two
of
donepezil
compared
with
rivastigmine
.

In
three
studies
the
patients
were
not
blinded
to
treatment
,
only
the
fourth
,
DON
vs
RIV
/
Bullock
is
double

.

Two
of
the
studies
provide
little
evidence
,
they
are
of
12
weeks
duration
,
which
is
barely
long
enough
to
complete
the
drug
titration
.

There
is
no
evidence
from
DON
vs
GAL
/
Wilcock
of
a
treatment
difference
between
donepezil
and
galantamine
at
52
weeks
for
cognition
,
activities
of
daily
living
,
the
numbers
who
leave
the
trial
before
the
end
of
treatment
,
the
number
who
suffer
any
adverse
event
,
or
any
specific
adverse
event
.

There
is
no
evidence
from
DON
vs
RIV
/
Bullock
of
a
difference
between
donepezil
and
rivastigmine
for
cognitive
function
,
activities
of
daily

and
behavioural
disturbance
at
two
years
.

Fewer
patients
suffer
adverse
events
on
donepezil
than
rivastigmine
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
The
three
cholinesterase
inhibitors
are
efficacious
for
mild
to
moderate
Alzheimer
'
s
disease
.

It
is
not
possible
to
identify
those
who
will
respond
to
treatment
prior
to
treatment
.

There
is
no
evidence
that
treatment
with
a
ChEI
is
not
cost
effective
.

Despite
the
slight
variations
in
the
mode
of
action
of
the
three
cholinesterase
inhibitors
there
is
no
evidence
of
any
differences
between
them
with
respect
to
efficacy
.

There
appears
to
be
less
adverse
effects
associated
with
donepezil
compared
with
rivastigmine
.

It
may
be
that
galantamine
and
rivastigmine
match
donepezil
in
tolerability
if
a
careful
and
gradual
titration
routine
over
more
than
three
months
is
used
.

Titration
with
donepezil
is
more
straightforward
and
the
lower
dose
may
be
worth
consideration
.

Intradialytic

are
frequently
altered
in

We
assessed
the

of
olive

compared
with
standard

during
intradialytic

:

The

increased
in

From
these

,
it
was
concluded
that
OO

similarly
improved

Structures
of

-
acetyltransferase
,
a
potential
therapeutic
drug

.

Spermidine
/
spermine
N1
-
acetyltransferase
(
SSAT
)
is
a
key
enzyme
in
the
control
of
polyamine
levels
in
human
cells
,
as
acetylation
of
spermidine
and
spermine
triggers
export
or
degradation
.

Increased
intracellular
polyamine
levels
accompany
several
types
of
cancers
as
well
as
other
human
diseases
,
and
compounds
that
affect
the
expression
,
activity
,
or
stability
of
SSAT
are
being
explored
as
potential
therapeutic
drugs
.

We
have
expressed
human
SSAT
from
the
cloned
cDNA
in
Escherichia
coli
and
have
determined
high
-
resolution
structures
of
wild
-
type
and
mutant
SSAT
,
as
the
free
dimer
and
in
binary
and
ternary
complexes
with
CoA

CoA

,

-
(
ethyl
)
-
norspermine
(

-

)
.

These
structures
show
details
of
binding
sites
for
cofactor
,
substrates
,
and
inhibitor
and
provide
a
framework
to
understand
enzymatic
activity
,
mutations
,
and
the
action
of
potential
drugs
.

Two
dimer
conformations
were
observed
:
a
symmetric
form
with
two
open
surface
channels
capable
of
binding
substrate
or
cofactor
,
and
an
asymmetric
form
in
which
only
one
of
the
surface
channels
appears
capable
of
binding
and
acetylating
polyamines
.

SSAT
was
found
to
self
-
acetylate
lysine
-
26
in
the
presence
of
AcCoA
and
absence
of
substrate
,
a
reaction
apparently
catalzyed
by
AcCoA
bound
in
the
second
channel
of
the
asymmetric
dimer
.

These
unexpected
and
intriguing
complexities
seem
likely
to
have
some
as
yet
undefined
role
in
regulating
SSAT
activity
or
stability
as
a
part
of
polyamine
homeostasis
.

Sequence

group
SSAT
with
proteins
that
appear
to
have
thialysine

Crystal
structure
of
the
IL
-
2
signaling
complex
:
paradigm
for
a
heterotrimeric
cytokine
receptor
.

IL
-
2
is
a
cytokine
that
functions
as
a
growth
factor
and
central
regulator
in
the
immune
system
and
mediates
its
effects
through
ligand
-
induced
hetero
-
trimerization
of
the
receptor
subunits
IL
-
2R
alpha
,
IL
-
2R
beta
,
and
gamma
(
c
)
.

Here
,
we
describe
the
crystal
structure
of
the
trimeric
assembly
of
the
human
IL
-
2
receptor
ectodomains
in
complex
with
IL
-

at

A

.

The
quaternary
structure
is
consistent
with
a
stepwise
assembly
from
IL
-
2
/
IL
-
2R
alpha
to
IL
-

/
IL

to
IL
-

/
IL
-
2R
alpha
/
IL
-
2R
beta
/
gamma
(
c
)
.

The
IL
-
2R
alpha
subunit
forms
the
largest
of
the
three
IL
-
2
/
IL
-
2R
interfaces
,
which
,
together
with
the
high
abundance
of
charge
-
charge
interactions
,
correlates
well
with
the
rapid
association
rate
and
high
-
affinity
interaction
of
IL
-
2R
alpha
with
IL
-
2
at
the
cell
surface
.

Surprisingly
,
IL
-
2R
alpha
makes
no
contacts
with
IL
-
2R
beta
or
gamma
(
c
)
,
and
only
minor
changes
are
observed
in
the
IL
-
2
structure
in
response
to
receptor
binding
.

These
findings
support
the
principal
role
of
IL
-
2R
alpha
to
deliver
IL
-
2
to
the
signaling
complex
and
act
as
regulator
of
signal
transduction
.

Cooperativity
in
assembly
of
the
final
quaternary
complex
is
easily
explained
by
the
extraordinarily
extensive
set
of
interfaces
found
within
the
fully
assembled
IL
-
2
signaling
complex
,
which
nearly
span
the
entire
length
of
the
IL
-
2R
beta
and
gamma
(
c
)
subunits
.

Helix
A
of
IL
-
2
wedges
tightly
between
IL

2R
beta
and
gamma
(
c
)
to
form
a
three
-
way
junction
that
coalesces
into
a
composite
binding
site
for
the
final
gamma
(
c
)
recruitment
.

The
IL
-
2
/
gamma
(
c
)
interface
itself
exhibits
the
smallest
buried
surface
and
the
fewest
hydrogen
bonds
in
the
complex
,
which
is
consistent
with
its
promiscuous
use
in
other
cytokine
receptor
complexes
.

Roles
of
rifampicin
in
drug
-
drug
interactions
:
underlying
molecular
mechanisms
involving
the
nuclear
pregnane
X
receptor
.

Rifampicin
,
an
important
drug
in
the
treatment
of
tuberculosis
,
is
used
extensively
despite
its
broad
effects
on
drug
-
drug
interactions
,
creating
serious
problems
.

The
clinical
importance
of
such
interactions
includes
autoinduction
leading
to
suboptimal
or
failed
treatment
.

The
concomitantly
administered
effects
of
rifampicin
on
other
drugs
can
result
in
their
altered
metabolism
or
transportation
that
are
metabolised
by
cytochromes
P450
or
transported
by
p
-
glycoprotein
in
the
gastrointestinal
tract
and
liver
.

This
review
paper
summarises
recent
findings
with
emphases
on
the
molecular
mechanisms
used
to
explain
these
broad
drug
-
drug
interactions
.

In
general
,
rifampicin
can
act
on
a
pattern
:
rifampicin
activates
the
nuclear
pregnane
X
receptor
that
in
turn
affects
cytochromes
P450
,
glucuronosyltransferases
and
p
-
glycoprotein
activities
.

This
pattern
of
action
may
explain
many
of
the
rifampicin
inducing
drug
-
drug
interactions
.

However
,
effects
through
other
mechanisms
have
also
been
reported
and
these
make
any
explanation
of
such
drug
-
drug
interactions
more
complex
.

Withdrawal
from
free
-
choice
ethanol
consumption
results
in
increased
packing
density
of
glutamine
synthetase
-
immunoreactive
astrocytes
in
the
prelimbic
cortex
of
alcohol
-
preferring
rats
.

Excess
activation
of
glutamatergic
neurotransmission
in
the
cerebral
cortex
following
ethanol
withdrawal
is
considered
to
contribute
to
significant
behavioural
disturbances
,
and
to
alcohol
craving
.

Astrocytes
may
play
a
role
in
these
manifestations
because
astrocytes
are
essential
in
the
regulation
of
released
glutamate
and
its
conversion
to
glutamine
through
the
enzyme
glutamine
synthetase
(
GS
)
.

However
,
it
is
unclear
if
withdrawal
from
free
-
choice
ethanol
drinking
causes
changes
in
the
numbers
of
astrocytes
expressing
GS
or
the
cytoskeletal
protein
of
astrocytes
glial
fibrillary
acidic
protein
(
GFAP
)
.

Alcohol

or
subjected
to

periods
along
6
months
.

At
2
months
,
P
rats
were
also
compared
with
alcohol

(

.

Packing

of
GS

IR
)
astrocytes
was
measured
in
sections
from
the
prelimbic
cortex
(
PLC
)
using
the
optical
disector
probe
.

An
alcohol
deprivation
effect
was
observed
in
P
rats
with
withdrawals
during
a
6
-
month
ethanol

period
.

Ethanol
withdrawal
significantly
increased
the
packing
density
of
GS

and
GFAP
-
IR
astrocytes
in
the
PLC
of
P
rats
as
compared
with
P
rats
with
continuous
access
to
ethanol
.

In
addition
,
there
was
a
positive
correlation
between
the
pre
-
withdrawal
ethanol
consumption
and
the
packing
density
of
GS
-
IR
astrocytes
.

The
present
results
suggest
the
involvement
of
astrocytes
in
the
regulation
of
the
glutamatergic
activation
associated
with
withdrawal
from
free

ethanol
consumption
and
point
to
differential
adaptations
of
GS
and
GFAP
to
prolonged

Abnormally
high
plasma
levels
of
vitamin
B6
in
children
with
autism
not
taking
supplements
compared
to
controls
not
taking
supplements
.

BACKGROUND
:
There
have
been
many
studies
of
the
effect
of
high
-
dose
supplementation
of
vitamin
B6
on
children
and
adults
with
autism
,
with
all
but
one
reporting
benefits
.

OBJECTIVE
:
The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
investigate
the
biochemical
basis
for
vitamin
B6
therapy
by
measuring
the
level
of
total
vitamin
B6
in
the
plasma
of
unsupplemented
children
with
autism
spectrum
disorder
compared
to
unsupplemented
control
subjects
.

PARTICIPANTS
:
Children
with
autism
spectrum
disorders
(
n
=
35
,
age
3
-
9
years
)
and
unrelated
typical
children
(
n
=
11
,
age
6
-
9
years
)
,
all
from
Arizona
,
were
studied
.

(
This
includes
the
data
from
24
children
with
autism
from
our
previous
study
.
)
METHODOLOGY
:
A
microbiologic
assay
was
used
to
measure
the
level
of
total
vitamin
B6
(
including
phosphorylated
and
unphosphorylated
forms
)
,
in
a
blinded
fashion
.

RESULTS
:
Children
with
autism
had
a
75
%
higher
level
of
total
vitamin
B6
than
the
controls
(
medians
of
56
versus
32
ng
/
mL
,
respectively
,
p
=
0
.
00002
)
.

Most
of
the
autistic
children
(
77
%
)
had
levels
that
were
more
than
2
standard
deviations
above
the
median
value
of
the
controls
.

The
autistic
girls
(
n
=
5
)
also
had
elevated
levels
(
mean
of
54
.
6
ng
/
mL
,
median
of
60
ng
/
mL
)
.

DISCUSSION
:
These
results
are
consistent
with
previous
studies
that
found
that
:
(
1
)
pyridoxal
kinase
had
a
very
low
activity
in
children
with
autism
and
(
2
)
pyridoxal
5
phosphate
(
PLP
)
levels
are
unusually
low
in
children
with
autism
.

Thus
,
it
appears
that
the
low
conversion
of
pyridoxal
and
pyridoxine
to
PLP
results
in
low
levels
of
PLP
,
which
is
the
active
cofactor
for
113
known
enzymatic
reactions
,
including
the
formation
of
many
key
neurotransmitters
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
Total
vitamin
B6
is
abnormally
high
in
autism
,
consistent
with
previous
reports
of
an
impaired
pyridoxal
kinase
for
the
conversion
of
pyridoxine
and
pyridoxal
to
PLP
.

This
may
explain
the
many
published
studies
of
benefits
of
high
-
dose
vitamin
B6
supplementation
in
some
children
and
adults
with
autism
.

New
assignments
for
multitasking
signal
transduction
inhibitors
.

An
article
presented
in
this
issue
of
Molecular
Pharmacology
(
p
.
1527
)
provides
an
intriguing
example
of
how
tyrosine
kinase
inhibitors
can
be
put
to
many
uses
.

In
this
article
,
the
action
of
dasatinib
(
BMS
-
354825
)
is
contrasted
with
that
of
imatinib
,
a
kinase
inhibitor
that
is
currently
being
used
to
treat
chronic
myelogenous
leukemia
and
other
disorders
.

Both
pharmacologic
inhibitors
target
several
tyrosine
kinases
,
including
Bcr
-
Abl
and
the
platelet
-
derived
growth
factor
receptor
(
PDGFR
)
.

Up
to
this
point
,
the
PDGFR
has
not
been
a
primary
therapeutic
target
for
this
class
of
agents
.

The
work
of
Chen
and
colleagues
shows
that
dasatinib
is
a
particularly
potent
inhibitor
of
PDGFR
and
that
the
compound
also
targets
Src
kinase
.

The
authors
suggest
that
this
combination
of
activities
could
be
useful
in
the
treatment
of
vascular
obstructive
diseases
.

Although
a
lack
of
absolute
specificity
has
typically
been
regarded
as
a
pharmacologic
drawback
,
this
study
exemplifies
how
drugs
with
multiple
molecular
targets
can
potentially
provide
a
very
beneficial
spectrum
of
therapeutic
activities
in
multiple
disease
states
.

Involvement
of
EP1
and
EP2
receptors
in
the
regulation
of
the
Na
,
K
-
ATPase
by
prostaglandins
in
MDCK
cells
.

Prostaglandins
are
key
regulators
of
ion
transport
in
the
kidney
.

In
MDCK
cells
,
which
model
distal
tubule
cells
,
the
transcription
of
the
Na
,
K
-
ATPase
beta1
subunit
is
regulated
by
PGE1
and
PGE2
.

To
identify
the
EP
receptors
that
mediate
transcriptional
regulation
,
transient
transfection
studies
are
conducted
using
the
human
beta1promoter
/
luciferase
construct
,
pHbeta1
-
1141
Luc
.

The
involvement
of
EP1
and
EP2
receptors
is
indicated
by
studies
with
the
EP1
selective
agonist
17
-
phenyl
trinor
PGE2
,
and
the
EP2
selective
agonist
butaprost
(
which
stimulate
)
,
as
well
as
by
studies
with
the
antagonists
SC
-
51089
(
EP1
specific
)
and
AH
6809
(
EP1
and
EP2
specific
)
.

Consistent
with
the
involvement
of
Gs
coupled
EP2
receptors
,
is
that
the
PGE1
stimulation
is
inhibited
by
the
PKAI
expression
vector
(
encoding
the
protein
kinase
A
(
PKA
)
inhibitory
protein
)
,
as
well
as
by
the
myristolated
PKA
inhibitory
peptide
PKI
.

In
addition
to
this
evidence
(
for
the
involvement
of
EP2
receptors
)
,
evidence
for
the
involvement
of
EP1
receptors
in
the
PGE1
mediated
stimulation
of
Na
,
K
-
ATPase
beta
subunit
gene
transcription
includes
the
stimulatory
effect
of
17
-
phenyl
trinor
PGE2
,
as
well
as
the
inhibitory
effects
of
SC
-
51089
.

Also
consistent
with
the
involvement
of
Gq
coupled
EP1
receptors
,
the
PGE1
stimulation
is
inhibited
by
the
PKCI
vector
(
encoding
the
PKC
inhibitory
domain
)
,
the
PKC
inhibitor
Go
6976
,
thapsigargin
,
as
well
as
the
calmodulin
antagonists
W7
and
W13
.

Corticotropin
-
releasing
hormone
reduces
pressure
pain
sensitivity
in
humans
without
involvement
of
beta
-
endorphin
(
1
-
31
)
,
but
does
not
reduce
heat
pain
sensitivity
.

In
the
present
study
the
effects
of
intravenously
administered
corticotropin
-
releasing
hormone
(
CRH
)
on
the
release
of
proopiomelanocortin
(
POMC
)
derivatives
such
as
adrenocorticotropic
hormone
(
ACTH
)
,
beta
-
lipotropin
(
beta
-
LPH
)
and
beta
-
endorphin
(
beta
-
END
)
as
well
as
direct
effects
of
CRH
on
pain
sensitivity
were
examined
.

In
16
healthy
volunteers
we
studied
the
effects
of
100
microg
intravenously
administered
CRH
in
absence
or
presence
of
12
mg
naloxone
on
heat
or
pressure
pain
sensitivity
,
using
a
double
-
blind
,
cross
-
over
and
placebo
-
controlled
design
.

To
evaluate
analgesic
effects
of
CRH
via
release
of
POMC
derivatives
,
we
determined
plasma
concentrations
of
beta
-
END
-
immunoreactive
material
(
IRM
)
,
authentic
beta
-
END
(
beta
-
END
(
1
-
31
)
)
and
beta
-
LPH
IRM
,
in
parallel
with
heat
and
pressure
pain
tolerance
thresholds
before
and
15
and
30
min
after
treatment
with
CRH
(
or
placebo
)
,
and
5
min
after
naloxone
(
or
placebo
)
administration
which
was
administered
40
min
after
CRH
(
or
placebo
)
injection
.

CRH
increased
levels
of
beta
-
END
IRM
,
beta
-
END
(
1
-
31
)
and
beta
-
LPH
IRM
.

As
compared
to
beta
-
END
IRM
levels
measured
by
a
commercial
RIA
kit
,
the
beta
-
END
(
1
-
31
)
levels
determined
by
a
highly
specific
two
-
site
RIA
,
proved
to
be
remarkably
small
.

Furthermore
,
CRH
did
not
induce
increases
of
heat
pain
tolerance
thresholds
,
but
of
pressure
pain
tolerance
thresholds
,
which
,
however
,
were
not
reversible
by
naloxone
.

Neither
beta
-
END
nor
beta
-
LPH
IRM
nor
beta
-
END
(
1
-
31
)
levels
correlated
with
heat
or
pressure
pain
tolerance
thresholds
.

We
conclude
that
CRH
does
not
modulate
heat
,
but
pressure
pain
;
POMC
derivatives
like
beta
-
END
IRM
,
beta
-
END
(
1
-
31
)
or
beta
-
LPH
do
not
mediate
this
effect
.

Antiobesity
action
of
peripheral
exenatide
(

)
in
rodents
:
effects
on
food
intake
,
body

,
metabolic
status
and
side
-
effect
measures
.

BACKGROUND
:
Exenatide
(
exendin
-
4
)
is
an
incretin
mimetic
currently
marketed
as
an
antidiabetic
agent
for
patients
with
type
2
diabetes
.

In
preclinical
models
,
a
reduction
in
body
weight
has
also
been
shown
in
low
-
fat
-
fed
,
leptin
receptor
-
deficient
rodents
.

OBJECTIVE
:
To
more
closely
model
the
polygenic
and
environmental
state
of
human
obesity
,
we
characterized
the
effect
of
exenatide
on
food
intake
and
body
weight
in
high
-
fat
-
fed
,
normal
(
those
with
an
intact
leptin
signaling
system
)
rodents
.

As
glucagon
-
like
peptide
-
1
receptor
agonism
has
been
found
to
elicit
behaviors
associated
with
visceral
illness
in
rodents
,
we
also
examined
the
effect
of
peripheral
exenatide
on
kaolin
consumption
and
locomotor
activity
.

METHODS
AND
RESULTS
:
High
-
fat
-
fed
C57BL
/
6
mice
and
Sprague
-
Dawley
rats
were
treated
with
exenatide
(
3
,
10
and
30
microg
/
kg
/
day
)
for
4
weeks
via
subcutaneously
implanted
osmotic
pumps
.

Food
intake
and
body
weight
were
assessed
weekly
.

At
4
weeks
,
body
composition
and
plasma
metabolic
profiles
were
measured
.

Kaolin
consumption
and
locomotor
activity
were
measured
in
fasted
Sprague
-
Dawley
rats
following
a
single
intraperitoneal
injection
of
exenatide
(
0
.
1
-
10
microg
/
kg
)
.

Exenatide
treatment
in
mice
and
rats
dose
-
dependently
decreased
food
intake
and
body
weight
;
significant
reductions
in
body
weight
gain
were
observed
throughout
treatment
at
10
and
30
microg
/
kg
/
day
(
P
<
0
.
05
)
.

Decreased
body
weight
gain
was
associated
with
a
significant
decrease
in
fat
mass
(
P
<
0
.
05
)
with
sparing
of
lean
tissue
.

Plasma
cholesterol
,
triglycerides
and
insulin
were
also
significantly
reduced
(
P
<
0
.
05
)
.

Exenatide
at
10
microg
/
kg
significantly
reduced
food
intake
(
P
<
0
.
05
)
but
failed
to
induce
kaolin
intake
.

In
general
,
locomotor
activity
was
reduced
at
doses
of
exenatide
that
decreased
food
intake
,
although
a
slightly
higher
dose
was
required
to
produce
significant
changes
in
activity
.

CONCLUSION
:
Systemic
exenatide
reduces
body
weight
gain
in
normal
,
high
-
fat
-
fed
rodents
,
a
model
that
parallels
human
genetic
variation
and
food
consumption
patterns
,
and
may
play
a
role
in
metabolic
pathways
mediating
food
intake
.

Sulindac

Colorectal
cancer
is
the
second
leading
cause
of
cancer
mortality
in
the
United
States
.

Substantial
human
and
animal
data
support
the
ability
of
nonsteroidal
anti
-
inflammatory
drugs
to
cause
regression
of
existing
colon
tumors
and
prevent
new
tumor
formation
.

The
mechanism
by
which
the
nonsteroidal
anti
-
inflammatory
drug
sulindac
prevents
tumor
growth
is
poorly
understood
and
seems
complex
as
sulindac
can
modulate
several
growth
-
related
signaling
pathways
.

Sulindac
metabolites
simultaneously
(
a
)
increase
cellular
cyclic
GMP
and
subsequently
activate
cyclic
GMP

dependent
protein
kinase
(
PKG
)
;
(
b
)
activate
c

jun
NH2
-

kinase
(
JNK
)
;
(
c
)
inhibit
extracellular
signal
-
regulated
kinase
1
/
2
(
ERK1

2
)
;
and
(
d
)
decrease
beta
-
catenin
protein
expression
at
times
and
doses
consistent
with
apoptosis
.

The
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
determine
if
PKG
,
ERK1
/
2
,
JNK
,
and
beta
-
catenin
are
independent
targets
for
sulindac
in
vitro
.

Pharmacologic
activation
of
PKG
with
YC
-
1
increases
JNK
phosphorylation
and
induces
apoptosis
in
colon
cancer
cells
without
modulating
ERK1
/
2
phosphorylation
or
beta
-
catenin
protein
expression
.

Inhibition
of
ERK1
/
2
with
U0126
induces
apoptosis
but
fails
to
activate
JNK
phosphorylation
or
down
-
regulate
beta
-
catenin
protein
expression
.

Cotreatment
with
U0126
and
YC
-
1
synergistically
increases
apoptosis
in
colorectal
cancer
cells
and
recapitulates
the
effects
of
sulindac
treatment
on
ERK1
/
2
,
JNK
,
and
beta
-
catenin
.

These
results
indicate
that
sulindac
metabolites
modulate
ERK1
/
2
and
PKG
pathways
independently
in
colon
cancer
cells
and
suggest
that
the
full
apoptotic
effect
of
sulindac
is
mediated
by
more
than
one
pathway
.

Using
similar
combinatorial
approaches
in
vivo
may
provide
more
effective
,
less
toxic
chemopreventive
and
chemotherapeutic
strategies
.

Such
therapies
could
dramatically
reduce
the
incidence
and
death
rate
from
colorectal
cancer

A

isolated
from
Ochrobactrum

has
also
been
employed
to
encode

to
detoxify

.

Glyphosate

viridochromogenes
,

,
have
been

.

Nanoparticles
coated
with
polysorbates
have
previously
been
shown
to
enable
the
transport
of
several
drugs
across
the
blood
-
brain
barrier
,
which
under
normal
circumstances
is
impermeable
to
these
compounds
.

Apolipoprotein
E
was
suggested
to
mediate
this
drug
transport
across
the
blood
-
brain
barrier
.

In
the
present
study
,
apolipoprotein
E
was
coupled
by
chemical
methods
to
nanoparticles
made
of
human
serum
albumin
(
HSA
-
NP
)
.

Loperamide
,
which
does
not
cross
the
blood
-
brain
barrier
but
exerts
antinociceptive
effects
after
direct
injection
into
the
brain
,
was
used
as
model
drug
.

Apolipoprotein
E
was
chemically
bound
via
linkers
to
loperamide
-
loaded
HSA
-
NP
.

This
preparation
induced
antinociceptive
effects
in
the
tail
-
flick
test
in
ICR
mice
after
i
.
v
.
injection
.

In
contrast
,
nanoparticles
linked
to
apolipoprotein
E
variants
that
do
not
recognize
lipoprotein
receptors
failed
to
induce
these
effects
.

These
results
indicate
that
apolipoprotein
E
attached
to
the
surface
of
nanoparticles
facilitates
transport
of
drugs
across
the
blood
-
brain
barrier
,
probably
after
interaction
with
lipoprotein
receptors
on
the
brain
capillary
endothelial
cell
membranes
.

Effect
of
antidepressant
drugs
in
mice
lacking
the
norepinephrine
transporter
.

One
of
the
main
theories
concerning
the
mechanism
of
action
of
antidepressant
drugs
(
ADs
)
is
based
on
the
notion
that
the
neurochemical
background
of
depression
involves
an
impairment
of
central
noradrenergic
transmission
with
a
concomitant
decrease
of
the
norepinephrine
(
NE
)
in
the
synaptic
gap
.

Many
ADs
increase
synaptic
NE
availability
by
inhibition
of
the
reuptake
of
NE
.

Using
mice
lacking
NE
transporter
(
NET
-
/
-
)
we
examined
their
baseline
phenotype
as
well
as
the
response
in
the
forced
swim
test
(
FST
)
and
in
the
tail
suspension
test
(
TST
)
upon
treatment
with
ADs
that
display
different
pharmacological
profiles
.

In
both
tests
,
the
NET
-
/
-
mice
behaved
like
wild
-
type
(
WT
)
mice
acutely
treated
with
ADs
.

Autoradiographic
studies
showed
decreased
binding
of
the
beta
-
adrenergic
ligand
[
3H
]
CGP12177
in
the
cerebral
cortex
of
NET
-
/
-
mice
,
indicating
the
changes
at
the
level
of
beta
-
adrenergic
receptors
similar
to
those
obtained
with
ADs
treatment
.

The
binding
of
[
3H
]
prazosin
to
alpha1
-
adrenergic
receptors
in
the
cerebral
cortex
of
NET
-
/
-
mice
was
also
decreased
,
most
probably
as
an
adaptive
response
to
the
sustained
elevation
of
extracellular
NE
levels
observed
in
these
mice
.

A
pronounced
NET
knockout
-
induced
shortening
of
the
immobility
time
in
the
TST
(
by
ca
50
%
)
compared
to
WT
mice
was
not
reduced
any
further
by
NET
-
inhibiting
ADs
such
as
reboxetine
,
desipramine
,
and
imipramine
.

Citalopram
,
which
is
devoid
of
affinity
for
the
NET
,
exerted
a
significant
reduction
of
immobility
time
in
the
NET
-
/
-
mice
.

In
the
FST
,
reboxetine
,
desipramine
,
imipramine
,
and
citalopram
administered
acutely
did
not
reduce
any
further
the
immobility
time
shortened
by
NET
knockout
itself
(
ca
25
%
)
;
however
,
antidepressant
-
like
action
of
repeatedly
(
7
days
)
administered
desipramine
was
observed
in
NET
-
/
-
mice
,
indicating
that
the
chronic
presence
of
this
drug
may
also
affect
other
neurochemical
targets
involved
in
the
behavioral
reactions
monitored
by
this
test
.

From
the
present
study
,
it
may
be
concluded
that
mice
lacking
the
NET
may
represent
a
good
model
of
some
aspects
of
depression
-
resistant
behavior
,
paralleled
with
alterations
in
the
expression
of
adrenergic
receptors
,
which
result
as
an
adaptation
to
elevated
levels
of
extracellular
NE
.

Physiological
oxygenation
status
is
required
for
fully
differentiated
phenotype
in
kidney
cortex
proximal
tubules
.

Hypoxia
has
been
suspected
to
trigger
transdifferentiation
of
renal
tubular
cells
into
myofibroblasts
in
an
epithelial
-
to
-
mesenchymal
transition
(
EMT
)
process
.

To
determine
the
functional
networks
potentially
altered
by
hypoxia
,
rat
renal
tubule
suspensions
were
incubated
under
three
conditions
of
oxygenation
ranging
from
normoxia
(
lactate
uptake
)
to
severe
hypoxia
(
lactate
production
)
.

Transcriptome
changes
after
4
h
were
analyzed
on
a
high
scale
by
restriction
fragment
differential
display
.

Among
1
,
533
transcripts
found
,
42
%
were
maximally
expressed
under
severe
hypoxia
and
8
%
under
mild
hypoxia
(
Po
(
2
)
=
48
mmHg
)
,
suggesting
two
different
levels
of
oxygen
sensing
.

Normoxia
was
required
for
full
expression
of
the
proximal
tubule
-
specific
transcripts
25
-
hydroxyvitamin
D
1
-
hydroxylase
(
Cyp27b1
)
and
l
-
pyruvate
kinase
(
Pklr
)
,
transcripts
involved
in
tissue
cohesion
such
as
fibronectin
(
Fn1
)
and
N
-
cadherin
(
Cdh2
)
,
and
non
-
muscle
-
type
myosin
transcripts
.

Mild
hypoxia
increased
myogenin
transcript
level
.

Conversely
,
severe
hypoxia
increased
transcripts
involved
in
extracellular
matrix
remodeling
,
those
of
muscle
-
type
myosins
,
and
others
involved
in
creatine
phosphate
synthesis
and
lactate
transport
(
Slc16a7
)
.

Accordingly
,
microscopy
showed
loss
of
tubule
aggregation
under
hypoxia
,
without
tubular
disruption
.

Hypoxia
also
increased
the
levels
of
kidney
-
specific
transcripts
normally
restricted
to
the
less
oxygenated
medullary
zone
and
others
specific
for
the
distal
part
of
the
nephron
.

We
conclude
that
extensive
oxygen
supply
to
the
kidney
tubule
favors
expression
of
its
differentiated
functions
specifically
in
the
proximal
tubule
,
whose
embryonic
origin
is
mesenchymal
.

The
phenotype
changes
could
potentially
permit
transient
adaptation
to
hypoxia
but
also
favor
pathological
processes
such
as
tissue
invasion
.

Reboxetine
versus
fluvoxamine
in
the
treatment
of
motor
vehicle
accident
-
related
posttraumatic
stress
disorder
:
a
double
-
blind
,
fixed
-
dosage
,
controlled
trial
.

BACKGROUND
:
Motor
vehicle
accidents
(
MVAs
)
are
a
leading
cause
of
posttraumatic
stress
disorder
(
PTSD
)
in
the
general
population
.

Alterations
in
norepinephrine
and
serotonin
systems
have
been
proposed
as
mechanisms
involved
in
the
pathophysiology
of
the
condition
,
with
treatment
directed
at
these
neurotransmitter
systems
.

Reboxetine
,
a
selective
norepinephrine
reuptake
inhibitor
,
exhibits
high
affinity
and
selectivity
for
the
human
norepinephrine
transporter
.

Inasmuch
as
PTSD
may
be
associated
with
dysregulation
of
noradrenergic
activity
,
the
present
double
-
blind
randomized
clinical
trial
intended
to
evaluate
reboxetine
'
s
efficacy
in
the
management
of
MVA
-
related
PTSD
and
to
compare
its
efficacy
with
a
medication
commonly
used
in
PTSD
,
the
selective
serotonin
reuptake
inhibitor
fluvoxamine
.

METHODS
:
Forty
patients
with
MVA
-
related
PTSD
attending
a
local
community
mental
health
outpatient
clinic
were
randomized
to
receive
a
fixed
dose
of
either
reboxetine
(
8
mg
/
d
)
or
fluvoxamine
(
150
mg
/
d
)
in
a
double
-
blind
fashion
for
a
period
of
8
weeks
.

RESULTS
:
At
baseline
and
at
study
end
point
,
the
2
subgroups
demonstrated
no
statistical
differences
in
scores
on
PTSD
,
depression
,
and
anxiety
rating
scales
.

Both
medications
led
to
significant
improvements
in
all
clinical
scales
measured
.

Nine
patients
receiving
reboxetine
and
3
receiving
fluvoxamine
withdrew
from
the
study
because
of
side
effects
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
Study
observations
indicate
comparable
efficacy
of
reboxetine
and
fluvoxamine
in
the
management
of
MVA
-
related
PTSD
despite
reboxetine
'
s
selective
noradrenergic
activity
.

Reboxetine
appears
to
be
at
least
as
effective
as
fluvoxamine
and
may
offer
an
alternative
management
option
in
this
often
difficult
-
to
-
treat
and
disabling
condition
.

A
lower
and
flexible
reboxetine
dosing
schedule
will
be
recommended
for
future
research
to
improve
its
tolerability
in
PTSD
patients
.

The
microsomal
/
peroxidase
antigen
:
modulation
of
its
expression
in
thyroid
cells
.

Evidence
has
accumulated
in
the
last
few
years
that
the
expression
of
the
microsomal
/
peroxidase
antigen
(
M
/
TPO
-
Ag
)
in
thyroid
cells
is
induced
by
TSH
,
through
pathways
which
involve
intracellular
cAMP
accumulation
and
protein
synthesis
.

These
data
have
been
found
true
in
any
thyroid
system
studied
so
far
,
both
in
terms
of
immunologic
and
enzymatic
activity
of
TPO
.

TSH
and
cAMP
also
increase
the
levels
of
the
specific
mRNA
for
TPO
in
thyroid
cells
from
different
species
.

Whether
this
phenomenon
is
due
to
a
direct
transcriptional
regulation
of
the
TPO
gene
,
as
shown
in
dog
thyroid
cells
,
or
to
posttranscriptional
effects
,
as
it
would
appear
in
FRTL
-
5
cells
,
remains
to
be
clarified
by
future
experiments
.

Thyroid
stimulating
antibody
(
TSAb
)
of
Graves
'
disease
also
stimulates
the
expression
of
M
/
TPO
-
Ag
.

This
finding
gives
further
support
to
the
relevance
of
TSAb
in
the
pathogenesis
of
hyperthyroidism
and
explains
the
well
known
observation
that
the
"
microsomal
"
antigen
is
particularly
abundant
in
glands
of
Graves
'
patients
.

The
modulation
of
M
/
TPO
-
Ag
surface
expression
by
TSH
can
explain
the
decrease
of
circulating
anti
-
MAb
observed
during
L
-
thyroxine
therapy
in
hypothyroid
patients
with
Hashimoto
'
s
thyroiditis
.

Other
agents
,
such
as
methimazole
and
sodium
iodide
,
which
influence
thyroid
cell
function
,
do
not
directly
interfere
with
the
expression
of
M
/
TPO
-
Ag
.

Cytokines
,
such
as
gamma
-
interferon
,
interleukin
-
1
,
and
interleukin
-
6
have
been
shown
to
inhibit
the
TSH
-
induced
increase
of
TPO
mRNA
,
but
further
investigations
are
required
to
elucidate
the
exact
role
of
cytokines
in
the
regulation
of
M
/
TPO
-
Ag
expression
.

Soy
protein
suppresses
gene
expression
of
acetyl
-
coA
carboxylase
alpha
from
promoter
PI
in
rat
liver
.

Dietary
soy
protein
isolate
(
SPI
)
reduces
hepatic
lipogenesis
by
suppressing
gene
expression
of
lipogenic
enzymes
,
including
acetyl
-
CoA
carboxylase
(
ACC
)
.

In
order
to
elucidate
the
mechanism
of
this
regulation
,
the
effect
of
dietary
SPI
on
promoter
(
PI
and
PII
)
specific
gene
expression
of
ACC
alpha
was
investigated
.

Rats
were
fed
experimental
diets
containing
SPI
or
casein
as
a
nitrogen
source
.

SPI
feeding
decreased
the
hepatic
contents
of
total
ACC
mRNA
as
well
as
triglyceride
(
TG
)
content
,
but
dietary
SPI
affected
the
amount
of
sterol
-
regulatory
element
binding
protein
(
SREBP
)
-
1
mRNA
and
protein
very
little
.

The
amount
of
ACC
mRNA
transcribed
from
PII
promoter
containing
SRE
was
not
significantly
affected
by
dietary
protein
,
while
a
significant
decrease
in
PI
-
generated
ACC
mRNA
content
was
observed
in
rats
fed
the
SPI
diet
.

These
data
suggest
that
SPI
feeding
decreased
the
hepatic
contents
of
ACC
alpha
mRNA
mainly
by
regulating
PI
promoter
via
a
nuclear
factor
(
s
)
other
than
SREBP

Changes
in
submaxillary
gland
gene
expression
in
F344
rats
by
multiple
dosing
of
theophylline
.

Multiple
exposure
to
theophylline
,
a
phosphodiesterase
(
PDE
)
inhibitor
,
induces
acinar
hypertrophy
in
the
salivary
gland
.

This
study
examined
the
effect
of
theophylline
on
the
gene
expression
of
secretory
proteins
and
phosphodiesterases
in
the
submaxillary
gland
.

Male
F344
rats
received
saline
or
theophylline
(
50
mg
/
kg
)
intraperitoneally
for
4
days
.

The
gene
expressions
for
the
secretory
protein
,
cystatin
S
(
CysS
)
,
and
PDE
subfamilies
3A
and
4D
in
the
submaxillary
gland
were
quantified
using
RT
-
PCR
.

Theophylline
exposure
resulted
in
a
sustained
increase
in
mRNA
expression
for
CysS
and
PDE3A
,
but
PDE4D
gene
expression
was
unchanged
.

Our
results
suggest
that
submaxillary
hypertrophy
is
primarily
caused
by
the
enhanced
transcription
of
CysS
,
and
that
the
transcription
of
each
PDE
subfamily
gene
is
regulated
differently
.

Comparative
proteomics
of
ovarian
epithelial
tumors
.

We
analyzed
12
ovarian
epithelial
tumors
using
2D
PAGE
-
based
comparative
proteomics
to
construct
intra
-
and
inter
-
tumoral
distance
map
trees
and
to
discover
surrogate
biomarkers
indicative
of
an
ovarian
tumor
.

The
analysis
was
performed
after
laser
microdissection
of
12
fresh
-
frozen
tissue
samples
,
including
4
serous
,
5
mucinous
,
and
3
endometrioid
tumors
,
with
correlation
with
their
histopathological
characteristics
.

Ovarian
epithelial
tumors
and
normal
tissues
showed
an
apparent
separation
on
the
distance
map
tree
.

Mucinous
carcinomas
were
closest
to
the
normal
group
,
whereas
serous
carcinomas
were
located
furthest
from
the
normal
group
.

All
mucinous
tumors
with
aggressive
histology
were
separated
from
the
low
malignant
potential
(
LMP
)
group
.

The
benign
-
looking
cysts
adjacent
to
the
intraepithelial
carcinoma
(
IEC
)
showed
an
expression
pattern
identical
to
that
of
the
IEC
area
.

The
extent
of
change
on
the
lineages
leading
to
the
mucinous
and
serous
carcinoma
was
1
.
98
-
fold
different
.

The
overall
gene
expression
profiles
of
serous
or
endometrioid
carcinomas
appeared
to
be
less
affected
by
grade
or
stage
than
by
histologic
type
.

The
potential
candidate
biomarkers
screened
in
ovarian
tumors
and
found
to
be
significantly
up
-
regulated
in
comparison
to
normal
tissues
were
as
follows
:
NM23
,
annexin
-
1
,
protein
phosphatase
-
1
,
ferritin
light
chain
,
proteasome
alpha
-
6
,
and
NAGK
(
N
-
acetyl
glucosamine
kinase
)
.

In
conclusion
,
ovarian
mucinous
tumors
are
distinct
from
other
ovarian
epithelial
tumors
.

LMP
mucinous
tumors
showing
histologically
aggressive
features
belong
to
mucinous
carcinoma
on
the
proteomic
basis

The
role
of
late

antiarrhythmic
drugs
in

in
Purkinje
fibers
.

Multiple
components
of
cardiac
Na
current
play
a
role
in
determining
electrical
excitation
in
the
heart
.

Recently
,
the
role
of
nonequilibrium
components
in
controlling
cardiac
action
potential
plateau
duration
,
and
their
importance
in
regulating
the
occurrence
of
afterdepolarizations
and
arrhythmias
have
garnered
more
attention
.

In
particular
,
late
Na
current
(
late
I
(
Na
)
)
has
been
shown
to
be
important
in
LQT2
and
LQT3
arrhythmias
.

Class
III
agents
like
dofetilide
,
clofilium
,
and
sotalol
,
which
can
all
cause
a
drug
-
induced
form
of
LQT2
,
significantly
lengthen
action
potential
duration
at
50
%
and
90
%
repolarization
in
isolated
rabbit
Purkinje
fibers
,
and
can
initiate
the
formation
of
early
afterdepolarizations
,
and
extra
beats
.

These
actions
can
lead
to
the
development
of
a
serious
ventricular
tachycardia
,
torsades
de
pointes
,
in
animal
models
and
patients
.

However
,
pretreatment
with
agents
that
block
late
I
(
Na
)
,
like
lidocaine
,
mexiletine
,
and
RSD1235
,
a
novel
mixed
ion
channel
blocker
for
the
rapid
pharmacologic
conversion
of
atrial
fibrillation
,
significantly
attenuates
the
prolonging
effects
of
Class
III
agents
or
those
induced
by
ATX
-
II
,
a
specific
toxin
that
delays
Na
channel
inactivation
and
amplifies
late
I
(
Na
)
greatly
,
mimicking
LQT3
.

The
Na
channel
block
caused
by
lidocaine
and
RSD1235
can
be
through
the
open
or
inactivated
states
of
the
channel
,
but
both
equivalently
inhibit
a
late

of
Na

These
protective
actions
of
lidocaine
,

,
and

Dynamics
of
NO
rebinding
to
the
heme
domain
of
NO
synthase
-
like
proteins
from
bacterial
pathogens
.

Some
Gram
-
positive
bacterial
pathogens
harbor
a
gene
that
encodes
a
protein
(
HNS
,
Heme
domain
of
NO
Synthase
-
like
proteins
)
with
striking
sequence
identity
to
the
oxygenase
domain
of
mammalian
NO
synthases
(
NOS
)
.

However
,
they
lack
the
N
-
terminal
and
the
Zn
-
cysteine
motif
participating
to
the
stability
of
an
active
dimer
in
the
mammalian
isoforms
.

The
unique
properties
of
HNS
make
it
an
excellent
model
system
for
probing
how
the
heme
environment
tunes
NO
dynamics
and
for
comparing
it
to
the
endothelial
NO
synthase
heme
domain
(
eNOS
(
HD
)
)
using
ultrafast
transient
spectroscopy
.

NO
rebinding
in
HNS
from
Staphylococcus
aureus
(
SA
-
HNS
)
is
faster
than
that
measured
for
either
Bacillus
anthracis
(
BA
-
HNS
)
or
for
eNOS
(
HD
)
in
both
oxidized
and
reduced
forms
in
the
presence
of
arginine
.

To
test
whether
these
distinct
rates
arise
from
different
energy
barriers
for
NO
recombination
,
we
measured
rebinding
kinetics
at
several
temperatures
.

Our
data
are
consistent
with
different
barriers
for
NO
recombination
in
SA
-
HNS
and
BA
-
HNS
and
the
presence
of
a
second
NO
-
binding
site
.

The
hypothesis
that
an
additional
NO
-
binding
cavity
is
present
in
BA
-
HNS
is
also
consistent
with
the
effect
of
the
NO
concentration
on
its
rebinding
.

The
lack
of
the
effect
of
NO
concentration
on
the
geminate
rebinding
in
SA
-
HNS
could
be
due
to
an
isolated
second
site
.

We
confirm
the
existence
of
a
second
NO
site
in
the
oxygenase
domain
of
the
reduced
eNOS
as
previously
hypothesized

Increasing

Sorafenib

a

that
targets

pathway
in

Activating
mutations
in

were
identified
in
several
human

In
addition
,
several
receptor
tyrosine
kinases
,
acting
upstream
of
Ras
,
were
found
either
mutated
or
overexpressed
in
human
tumors
.

Because
oncogenic
activation
of
the
Ras
/
RAF
pathway
may
lead
to
a
sustained
proliferative
signal
resulting
in
tumor
growth
and
progression
,
inhibition
of
this
pathway
represents
an
attractive
approach
for
cancer
drug
discovery
.

A
novel
class
of
biaryl
urea
that
inhibits
C
-
RAF
kinase
was
discovered
using
a
combination
of
medicinal
and
combinatorial
chemistry
approaches
.

This
effort
culminated
in
the
identification
of
the
clinical
candidate
BAY
43
-
9006
(
Sorafenib
,
Nexavar
)
,
which
has
recently
been
approved
by
the
FDA
for
advanced
renal
cell
carcinoma
in
phase
III
clinical
trials
.

Sorafenib
inhibited
the
kinase
activity
of
both
C
-
RAF
and
B
-
RAF
(
wild
type
and
V600E
mutant
)
.

It
inhibited
MEK
and
ERK
phosphorylation
in
various
cancer
cell
lines
and
tumor
xenografts
and
exhibited
potent
oral
antitumor
activity
in
a
broad
spectrum
of
human
tumor
xenograft
models
.

Further
characterization
of
sorafenib
revealed
that
this
molecule
was
a
multikinase
inhibitor
that
targeted
the
vascular
endothelial
growth
factor
receptor
family
(
VEGFR
-
2
and
VEGFR
-
3
)
and
platelet
-
derived
growth
factor
receptor
family
(
PDGFR
-
beta
and
Kit
)
,
which
play
key
roles
in
tumor
progression
and
angiogenesis
.

Thus
,
sorafenib
may
inhibit
tumor
growth
by
a
dual
mechanism
,
acting
either
directly
on
the
tumor
(
through
inhibition
of
Raf
and
Kit
signaling
)
and
/
or
on
tumor
angiogenesis
(
through
inhibition
of
VEGFR
and
PDGFR
signaling
)
.

In
phase
I
and
phase
II
clinical
trials
,
sorafenib
showed
limited
side
effects
and
,
more
importantly
,
disease
stabilization

This
agent
is
currently
being
evaluated
in
phase

A
molecular
mechanism
of
pyruvate
protection
against
cytotoxicity
of
reactive
oxygen
species
in
osteoblasts
.

We
demonstrated
previously
that
exogenous
pyruvate
has
a
protective
action
against
cell
death
by
hydrogen
peroxide
in
cultured
osteoblasts
through
a
mechanism
associated
with
its
antioxidative
property
.

In
the
present
study
,
we
have
evaluated
possible
participation
of
monocarboxylate
transporters
(
MCTs
)
responsible
for
the
bidirectional
membrane
transport
of
pyruvate
in
the
cytoprotective
property
in
osteoblasts
.

Expression
of
the
MCT2
isoform
was
found
in
cultured
rat
calvarial
osteoblasts
and
in
osteoblasts
located
on
mouse
tibia
at
both
mRNA
and
protein
levels
.

The
accumulation
of
[
14C
]
pyruvate
occurred
in
a
temperature
-
and
pH
-
dependent
manner
in
osteoblasts
cultured
for
7
days
with
high
sensitivity
to
a
specific
MCT
inhibitor
,
whereas
pyruvate
was
released
into
extracellular
spaces
from
cultured
osteoblasts
in
a
fashion
sensitive
to
the
MCT
inhibitor
.

Transient
overexpression
of
the
MCT2
isoform
led
to
reduced
vulnerability
to
the
cytotoxicity
of
hydrogen
peroxide
with
an
increased
activity
of
[
14C
]
pyruvate
accumulation
in
murine
osteoblastic
MC3T3
-
E1
cells
.

Ovariectomy
significantly
decreased
the
content
of
pyruvate
in
femoral
bone
marrows
in
mice
in

whereas
daily
i

p

administration
of
pyruvate
at

25
g

significantly
prevented
alterations

histomorphometric
parameters
as
well
as
cancellous
bone
loss
in
femurs
by
ovariectomy
on
28
days
after
the
operation
.

These
results
suggest
that
MCTs
may
be
functionally
expressed
by
osteoblasts
to
play
a
pivotal
role
in
mechanisms
related
to
the
cytoprotective
property
of
pyruvate

Functional
divergence
of
a
unique
C
-
terminal
domain
of
leucyl
-
tRNA
synthetase
to
accommodate
its
splicing
and
aminoacylation
roles
.

Leucyl
-
tRNA
synthetase
(
LeuRS
)
performs
dual
essential
roles
in
group
I
intron
RNA
splicing
as
well
as
protein
synthesis
within
the
yeast
mitochondria
.

Deletions
of
the
C
terminus
differentially
impact
the
two
functions
of
the
enzyme
in
splicing
and
aminoacylation
in
vivo
.

Herein
,
we
determined
that
a
fiveamino
acid
C
-
terminal
deletion
of
LeuRS
,
which
does
not
complement
a
null
strain
,
can
form
a
ternary
complex
with
the
bI4
intron
and
its
maturase
splicing
partner
.

However
,
the
complex
fails
to
stimulate
splicing
activity
.

The
x
-
ray
co
-
crystal
structure
of
LeuRS
showed
that
a
C
-
terminal
extension
of
about
60
amino
acids
forms
a
discrete
domain
,
which
is
unique
among
the
LeuRSs
and
interacts
with
the
corner
of
the
L
-
shaped
tRNALeu
.

Interestingly
,
deletion
of
the
entire
yeast
mitochondrial
LeuRS
C
-
terminal
domain
enhanced
its
aminoacylation
and
amino
acid
editing
activities
.

In
striking
contrast
,
deletion
of
the
corresponding
C
-
terminal
domain
of
Escherichia
coli
LeuRS
abolished
aminoacylation
of
tRNALeu
and
also
amino
acid
editing
of
mischarged
tRNA
molecules
.

These
results
suggest
that
the
role
of
the
leucine
-
specific
C
-
terminal
domain
in
tRNA
recognition
for
aminoacylation
and
amino
acid
editing
has
adapted
differentially
and
with
surprisingly
opposite
effects
.

We
propose
that
the
secondary
role
of
yeast
mitochondrial
LeuRS
in
RNA
splicing
has
impacted
the
functional
evolution
of
this
critical
C
-
terminal
domain

Methionine

MetAP2
)
is
a
novel
target
for
cancer

.

As
part
of
an

to

orally
active
reversible
inhibitors
of
MetAP2
,
a
series
of
anthranilic
acid
sulfonamides
with
micromolar
affinities
for
human
MetAP2
were
identified
using
affinity
selection
by
mass

.

These
micromolar
hits
were
rapidly
improved
to
nanomolar
leads
on
the
basis
of
insights
from
protein
crystallography
;
however
,
the
compounds
displayed
extensive
binding
to
human
serum
albumin
and
had
limited
activity
in
cellular
assays
.

Modifications
based
on
structural
information
on
the
binding
of
lead
compounds
to
both
MetAP2
and
domain
III
of
albumin
allowed
the
identification
of
compounds
with
significant
improvements
in
both
parameters
,
which
showed
good
cellular
activity
in
both
proliferation
and
methionine

assays
.

Mitochondrial
arginase
II
modulates
nitric
-
oxide
synthesis
through
nonfreely
exchangeable
L
-
arginine
pools
in
human
endothelial
cells
.

Reduced
synthesis
of
nitric
oxide
(
NO
)
contributes
to
the
endothelial
dysfunction
and
may
be
related
to
limited
availability
of
L

,
the
common
substrate
of
constitutive
nitric
-
oxide
synthase
(
NOS
)
and
cytosolic
arginase
I
and
mitochondrial
arginase
II
.

To
determine
whether
arginases
modulate
the
endothelial
NO
synthesis
,
we
investigated
the
effects
of
the
competitive
arginase
inhibitor
N
(
omega
)
-
hydroxy
-
nor
-
L
-
arginine
(
Nor
-

)
on

activity
of

,
arginases
,
and
L
-
arginine
transporter
and
on
NO
release
at
surface
of
human
umbilical
vein
endothelial
cells
(
HUVECs
)
.

In
unstimulated
cells
,
Nor
-
NOHA
dose
-
dependently
reduced
the
arginase
activity
with
maximal
inhibition
at
20
microM
.

When
HUVECs
were
stimulated
by
thrombin
without
extracellular
L
-
arginine
,
Nor
-
NOHA
dose
-
dependently
increased
the
NOS
activity
and
the
NO
release
with
maximal
effects
at
20
microM
.

Extracellular
L
-
arginine
also
dose
-
dependently
increased
NO
release
and
arginase
activity
.

When
HUVECs
were
stimulated
by
thrombin
in
the
presence
of
100
microM
L
-
arginine
,
NOS
activity
and
NO
release
were
similar
in
untreated
and
Nor
-
NOHA
-
treated
cells
.

However
,
despite
activation
of
L
-
arginine
uptake
,
the
inhibition
of
arginase
activity
by
Nor
-
NOHA
was
still
significant
.

The
depletion
of
freely
exchangeable
L
-
arginine
pools
with
extracellular
L
-
lysine
did
not
prevent
Nor
-
NOHA
from
increasing
the
NO
release
.

This
indicates
the
presence
of
pools
,
which
are
accessible
to
NOS
and
arginase
,
but
not
exchangeable
.

Interestingly
,
the
mitochondrial
arginase
II
was
constitutively
expressed
,
whereas
the
cytosolic
arginase
I
was
barely
detectable
in
HUVECs
.

These
data
suggest
that
endothelial
NO
synthesis
depends
on
the
activity
of
arginase
II
in
mitochondria
and
l
-
arginine
carriers
in
cell
membrane

key
role
in
insulin
secretion
,
we
examined
whether
adrenaline
modulates
voltage
-
dependent
Ca2
+
currents
of
the
rat
insulinoma
cell
line
,
RINm5F
.

In
the
whole
-
cell
configuration
of
the
patch
-
clamp
technique
,
dihydropyridine
-
but
not
omega
-
conotoxin
-
sensitive
Ca2
+
currents
were
identified
.

Adrenaline
via
alpha
2
-
adrenoceptors
inhibited
the
Ca2
+
currents
by
about
50
%
.

Somatostatin
which
also
inhibits
insulin
secretion
was
less
efficient
(
inhibition
by
20
%
)
.

The
hormonal
inhibition
of
Ca2
+
currents
was
not
affected
by
intracellularly
applied
cAMP
but
blocked
by
the
intracellularly
applied
GDP
analog
guanosine
5
'
-
O
-
(
2
-
thiodiphosphate
)
and
by
pretreatment
of
cells
with
pertussis
toxin
.

In
contrast
to
adrenaline
and
somatostatin
,
galanin
,
another
inhibitor
of
insulin
secretion
,
reduced
Ca2
+
currents
by
about
40
%
in
a
pertussis
toxin
-
insensitive
manner
.

Immunoblot
experiments
performed
with
antibodies
generated
against
synthetic
peptides
revealed
that
membranes
of
RINm5F
cells
possess
four
pertussis
toxin
-
sensitive
G
-
proteins
including
Gi1
,
Gi2
,
Go2
,
and
another
Go
subtype
,
most
likely
representing
Go1
.

In
membranes
of
control
but
not
of
pertussis
toxin
-
treated
cells
,
adrenaline
via
alpha
2
-
adrenoceptors
stimulated
incorporation
of
the
photo

reactive
GTP
analog
[
alpha

32P
]
GTP
azidoanilide
into
pertussis
toxin
substrates
comigrating
with
the
alpha
-
subunits
of
Gi2
,
Go2
,
and
the
not
further
identified
Go
subtype
.

The
present
findings
indicate
that
activated
alpha
2
-
adrenoceptors
of
RINm5F
cells
interact
with
multiple
G
-
proteins
,
i
.
e
.
two
forms
of
Go
and
with
Gi2
.

These
G
-
proteins
are
likely
to
be
involved
in
the
adrenaline
-
induced
inhibition
of
dihydropyridine
-
sensitive
Ca2

currents
and
in
other
signal
transduction
pathways
contributing
to
the
adrenaline

Acromegaly
:
molecular
expression
of
somatostatin
receptor
subtypes
and
treatment
outcome
.

About
a
third
of
acromegalic
patients
are
resistant
to
the
currently
commercially
available
somatostatin
analogs
(
SA
)
octreotide
and
lanreotide
.

Such
resistance
is
related
to
an
overall
reduction
of
somatostatin
receptor
(
SSTR
)
density
or
to
a
differentiated
expression
of
SSTR
subtypes
.

There
are
five
known
SSTR
subtypes
.

SSTR2
and
SSTR5
are
usually
expressed
in
GH
-
secreting
pituitary
tumors
,
and
both
octreotide
and
lanreotide
bind
preferentially
to
SSTR2
and
,
to
a
lesser
extent
,
to
SSTR5
.

SA
inhibitory
effects
on
GH
secretion
and
tumor
cell
proliferation
can
occur
together
or
be
dissociated
events
,
depending
on
the
tumor
expression
of
SSTR
subtypes
involved
in
each
mechanism
.

The
development
of
specific
somatostatin
subtypes
analogs
,
mainly
for
SSTR5
,
of
a
SSTR2
-
SSTR5
bispecific
compound
,
and
of
a
"
universal
"
analog
with
high
affinity
to
SSTR1
,
2
,

,
and
5
showed
preliminary
,
albeit
promising
results
for
the
treatment
of
resistant
somatotropic
adenomas
.

Gene
deletion
reveals
roles
for
annexin
A1
in
the
regulation
of
lipolysis
and
IL
-
6
release
in
epididymal
adipose
tissue
.

In
this
study
,
epididymal
adipose
tissue
from
male
annexin
1
(
ANXA1
)
-
null
and
wild
-
type
control
mice
were
used
to
explore
the
potential
role
of
ANXA1
in
adipocyte
biology
.

ANXA1
was
detected
by
Western
blot
analysis
in
wild
-
type
tissue
and
localized
predominantly
to
the
stromal
-
vascular
compartment
.

Epididymal
fat
pad
mass
was
reduced
by
ANXA1
gene
deletion
,
but
adipocyte
size
was
unchanged
,
suggesting
that
ANXA1
is
required
for
the
maintenance
of
adipocyte
and
/
or
preadipocyte
cell
number
.

Epididymal
tissue
from
wild
-
type
mice
responded
in
vitro
to
noradrenaline
and
isoprenaline
with
increased
glycerol
release
,
reduced
IL
-
6
release
,
and
increased
cAMP
accumulation
.

Qualitatively
similar
but
significantly
attenuated
responses
to
the
catecholamines
were
observed
in
tissue
from
ANXA1
-
null
mice
,
an
effect
that
was
not
associated
with
changes
in
beta
-
adrenoceptor
mRNA
expression
.

Lipopolysaccharide
(
LPS
)
also
stimulated
lipolysis
in
vitro
,
but
its
effects
were
muted
by
ANXA1
gene
deletion
.

By
contrast
,
LPS
failed
to
influence
IL
-
6
release
from
wild
-
type
tissue
but
stimulated
the
release
of
the
cytokine
from
tissue
from
ANXA1
-
null
mice
.

ANXA1
gene
deletion
did
not
affect
glucocorticoid
receptor
expression
or
the
ability
of
dexamethasone
to
suppress
catecholamine
-
induced
lipolysis
.

It
did
,
however
,
augment
IL
-
6
expression
and
modify
the
inhibitory
effects
of
glucocorticoids
on
IL
-
6
release
.

Collectively
,
these
studies
suggest
that
ANXA1
supports
aspects
of
adipose
tissue
mass
and
alters
the
sensitivity
of
epididymal
adipose
tissue
to
catecholamines
,
glucocorticoids
,
and
LPS
,
thereby
modulating
lipolysis
and
IL
-
6
release
.

Two
novel
mutations
in
the
MEN1
gene
in
subjects
with
multiple
endocrine
neoplasia
-
1
.

Multiple
endocrine
neoplasia
type
1
(
MEN1
)
is
characterized
by
parathyroid
,
enteropancreatic
endocrine
and
pituitary
adenomas
as
well
as
germline
mutation
of
the
MEN1
gene
.

We
describe
2
families
with
MEN1
with
novel
mutations
in
the
MEN1
gene
.

One
family
was
of
Turkish
origin
,
and
the
index
patient
had
primary
hyperparathyroidism
(
PHPT
)
plus
a
prolactinoma
;
three
relatives
had
PHPT
only
.

The
index
patient
in
the
second
family
was
a
46
-
yr
-
old
woman
of
Chinese
origin
living
in
Taiwan
.

This
patient
presented
with
a
complaint
of
epigastric
pain
and
watery
diarrhea
over
the
past
3
months
,
and
had
undergone
subtotal
parathyroidectomy
and
enucleation
of
pancreatic
islet
cell
tumor
about
10
yr
before
.

There
was
also
a
prolactinoma
.

Sequence
analysis
of
the
MEN1
gene
from
leukocyte
genomic
DNA
revealed
heterozygous
mutations
in
both
probands
.

The
Turkish
patient
and
her
affected
relatives
all
had
a
heterozygous
A
to
G
transition
at
codon
557
(
AAG
-
-
>
GAG
)
of
exon
10
of
MEN1
that
results
in
a
replacement
of
lysine
by
glutamic
acid
.

The
Chinese
index
patient
and
one
of
her
siblings
had
a
heterozygous
mutation
at
codon
418
of
exon
9
(
GAC
-
-
>
TAT
)
that
results
in
a
substitution
of
aspartic
acid
by
tyrosine
.

In
conclusion
,
we
have
identified
2
novel
missense
mutations
in
the
MEN1
gene

Comparison
of
cyclooxygenase
inhibitory
activity
and
ocular
anti
-
inflammatory
effects
of
ketorolac
tromethamine
and
bromfenac
sodium
.

OBJECTIVE
:
To
compare
the
cyclooxygenase
(
COX
)
activity
and
anti

inflammatory
effects
of
the
nonsteroidal
anti
-
inflammatory
drugs
(
NSAIDs
)
ketorolac
tromethamine
(
ketorolac
)
and
bromfenac
sodium
(
bromfenac
)
.

METHODS
:
Cyclooxygenase
activity
and
selectivity
was
determined
in
vitro
by
measuring
prostaglandin
E
(
2
)
(
PGE
(
2
)
)
production
following
incubation
of
varying
concentrations
of
NSAID
with
human
recombinant
COX
-
1
or
COX
-
2
and
arachidonic
acid
.

Anti
-
inflammatory
effects
were
evaluated
in
a
rabbit
model
in
which
an
ocular
inflammatory
response
was
induced
by
intravenous
injection
of
10
microg
/
kg
lipopolysaccharide
(
LPS
)
.

In
study
animals
,
one
eye
was
treated
with

and
the
other
eye
with

.

In
control
animals
,
both
eyes
were
treated
with
vehicle
.

All
animals
were
treated
twice
:
2
hours
and
1
hour
before
LPS
.

MAIN
OUTCOME
MEASURES
:

,
measured
by
fluorophotometry
;
aqueous
PGE
(

,
measured
by
ELISA
immunoassay
.

RESULTS
:
Ketorolac
was
six
times
more
active
against
COX

)
.

In
the
animal
model
,
both
drugs
resulted
in
nearly
complete
inhibition
of
FITC
-
dextran
leakage
and
PGE
(
2
)
production
in
the
anterior
chamber
of
treated
eyes
.

There
was
also
a
79
%
inhibition
(
p

001
)
of
FITC
-
dextran
leakage
in
the
contralateral
eyes
of
bromfenac

treated
rabbits
,
and
a
22
.
5
%
inhibition
(
not
statistically
significant
)
in
the
contralateral
eyes
of
ketorolac
-
treated
rabbits
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
Ketorolac
is
relatively
COX
-
1
selective
while
bromfenac
is
potently
selective
for
COX
-
2
over
COX

1
.

In
the
animal
model
,
both
ketorolac

09
%
demonstrated
maximal
anti

%
had
a
significant
effect
on
the
contralateral

.

A
theoretical
study
.

Density

calculations
using
the
hybrid
functional
B3LYP
have
been
performed
to
study
the
methyl
transfer
step
in
glycine
N
-
methyltransferase
(
GNMT
)
.

This
enzyme
catalyzes
the
S
-
adenosyl
-
L
-
methionine
(
SAM
)
-
dependent
methylation
of
glycine
to
form
sarcosine
.

The
starting
point
for
the
calculations
is
the
recent
X

ray
crystal
structure
of
GNMT
complexed
with
SAM
and
acetate
.

Several
quantum
chemical
models
with
different
sizes
,
employing
up
to
98
atoms
,
were
used
.

The
calculations
demonstrate
that
the
suggested
mechanism
,
where
the
methyl
group
is
transferred
in
a
single
S
(
N
)
2
step
,
is
thermodynamically
plausible
.

By
adding
or
eliminating
various
groups
at
the
active
site
,
it
was
furthermore
demonstrated
that
hydrogen
bonds
to
the
amino
group
of
the
glycine
substrate
lower
the
reaction
barrier
,
while
hydrogen
bonds
to
the
carboxylate
group
raise
the
barrier
.

CRDs
were
produced
in

and
colorectal

were
assessed
by
measuring

.

In

The

was
maintained
in
a
rodent
model
of

(
4

)
.

At
a
dose
of
100
mg

,
ATB

429
reversed
the
allodynic

caused
by

.

Colonic
cyclooxygenase

were
significantly
down

but
not
mesalamine
,
increased
blood
concentrations
of
H
(

)
S
in
both
healthy

.

Taken
together
,
these
data
suggest
that

in
both

.

OBJECTIVE
:
To
screen
and
characterize
the
short
peptides
which
bind
specifically
to
interleukin
-
2
(
IL
-
2
)
receptor
alpha
chain
(
IL
-
2Ralpha
)
for
acquisition
of
small
antagonists
for
blocking
the
binding
of
IL
-
2
with
IL
-
2Ralpha
.

METHODS
:
12
-
mer
phage
displayed
peptide
library
was
screened
with
the
target
cells
of
MT
-
2
cells
which
expressed

.

After
3
rounds
of
screening
,
the
positive

and
immunohistochemistry
,
and
the
amino

RESULTS
:
Seven
positive
clones
were
screened
out
of
the
17
phage
clones
bound
to

could
bind
specifically
to

CONCLUSION
:
The
peptide
sequences
containing
Tyr

.

Since
both
siRNAs
showed
biological
activity
,
for
stable
inhibition
of
ABCC2
a
corresponding
short
hairpin
RNA
(
shRNA
)
-
encoding
expression
vector
was
designed
.

By
treatment
of
A2780RCIS
cells
with
this
construct
,
the
expressions
of
the
targeted
ABCC2
encoding
mRNA
and
transport
protein
were
inhibited
.

These
effects
were
accompanied
by
reversal
of
resistance
against
cisplatin
and
paclitaxel
.

Thus
,
the
data
demonstrate
the
utility
of
the
analyzed
RNAs
as
powerful
laboratory
tools
and
indicate
that
siRNA
-
and
shRNA
-
mediated
RNAi
-
based
gene
therapeutic
approaches
may
be
applicable
in
preventing
and
reversing
ABCC2

Mutations
within
the
human
GLYT2
(
SLC6A5
)
gene
associated
with
hyperekplexia
.

Hereditary
hyperekplexia
is
a
neuromotor
disorder
characterized
by
exaggerated
startle
reflexes
and
muscle
stiffness
in
the
neonate
.

The
disease
has
been
associated
with
mutations
in
the
glycine
receptor
subunit
genes
GLRA1
and
GLRB
.

Here
,
we
describe
mutations
within
the
neuronal
glycine
transporter
2
gene
(
GLYT2
,
or
SLC6A5
,
)
of
hyperekplexia
patients
,
whose
symptoms
cannot
be
attributed
to
glycine
receptor
mutations
.

One
of
the
GLYT2
mutations
identified
causes
truncation
of
the
transporter
protein
and
a
complete
loss
of
transport
function
.

Our
results
are
consistent
with
GLYT2
being
a
disease
gene
in
human
hyperekplexia
.

Bovine
and
ovine
gonadotropin
-
releasing
hormone
(
GnRH
)
-
II
ligand
precursors
and
type
II
GnRH
receptor
genes
are
functionally
inactivated
.

The
decapeptide
sequence
of
GnRH
-
II
is
conserved
in
all
jawed
vertebrate
species
studied
to
date
.

New
data
for
cattle
(
Bos
taurus
)
indicates
a
gene
encoding
GnRH
-
II
decapeptide
possessing
arginine
(
codon
:
CGG
)
rather
than
tryptophan
(
TGG
)
at
position
three
in
the
mature
peptide
.

This
substitution
is
unique
.

We
confirmed
the
DNA
sequence
after
cloning
part
of
the
bovine
prepro
-
GnRH
-
II
gene
.

Bovine
GnRH
-
II
peptide
was
synthesized
and
pharmacologically
characterized
.

It
did
not
bind
to
mammalian
GnRH
receptors
expressed
in
different
types
of
cell
nor
did
it
exhibit
agonist
or
antagonist
properties
on
types
I
or
II
GnRH
receptors
expressed
in
COS
-
7
cells
.

Bovine
primers
facilitated
cloning
of
ovine
GnRH
-
II
DNA
.

A
premature
stop
codon
(
TGA
)
replaces
the
expected
tryptophan
codon
at
position
seven
of
GnRH
-
II
in
sheep
DNA
.

Thus
,
both
species
possess
prepro
-
GnRH
-
II
genes
encoding
inactive
peptides
,
as
previously
described
for
chimpanzee
GnRH
-
II
.

The
updated
bovine
type
II
GnRH
receptor
gene
sequence
revealed
inactivation
by
frame
shifts
,
premature
stop
codons
,
and
nucleotide
changes
specifying
nonconservative
replacement
of
amino
acid
residues
,
similar
to
inactivation
of
sheep
type
II
GnRH
receptor
.

Spliced
RNA
transcripts
from
the
disrupted
receptor
gene
were
not
detected
in
bovine
pituitary
.

In
contrast
,
bovine
prepro
-
GnRH
-
I
and
type
I
GnRH
receptor
genes
are
intact
,
encoding
well
-
conserved
protein
sequences
.

These
findings
,
and
previous
descriptions
of
inactivation
of
the
human
type
II
GnRH
receptor
and
deletions
of
prepro
-
GnRH
-
II
and
type
II
GnRH
receptor
in
laboratory
rodents
,
suggest
the
GnRH
-
II
system
has
been
replaced
by
the
GnRH
-
I
system
or
is
redundant
in
certain
mammals
.

Liver
choline
dehydrogenase
and
kidney
betaine
-
homocysteine
methyltransferase
expression
are
not
affected
by
methionine
or
choline
intake
in
growing
rats
.

Choline
dehydrogenase
(
CHDH
)
and
betaine
-
homocysteine
methyltransferase
(
BHMT
)
are
2
enzymes
involved
in
choline
oxidation
.

BHMT
is
expressed
at
high
levels
in
rat
liver
and
its
expression
is
regulated
by
dietary
Met
and
choline
.

BHMT
is
also
found
in
rat
kidney
,
albeit
in
substantially
lower
amounts
,
but
it
is
not
known
whether
kidney
BHMT
expression
is
regulated
by
dietary
Met
or
choline
.

Similarly
,
CHDH
activity
is
highest
in
the
liver
and
kidney
,
but
the
regulation
of
its
expression
by
diet
has
not
been
thoroughly
investigated
.

Sprague
Dawley
rats
(
approximately
50
g
)
were
fed
,
for
9

(

,
an

)
and
choline
(

)
.

Liver
and
kidney
BHMT
and
CHDH
were
assessed
using
enzymatic
,
Western

,
and
real

PCR
analyses
.

Liver
samples
were
also
fixed
for
histological

.

Liver
BHMT
activity
was
1
.
3
-
fold
higher
in
rats
fed
the
Met
deficient
diet
containing
choline
,
which
was
reflected
in
corresponding
increases
in
mRNA
content
and
immunodetectable
protein
.

Independent
of
dietary
choline
,
supplemental
Met
increased
hepatic
BHMT
activity
approximately
30
%
.

Kidney
BHMT
and
liver
CHDH
expression
were
refractory
to
these
diets
.

Some
degree
of
fatty
liver
developed
in
all
rats
fed
a
choline

devoid
diet
,
indicating
that
supplemental
Met
cannot
completely
compensate
for
the
lack
of
dietary
choline
in
growing
rats
.

Temporal

gonadotropin
mRNA
expression
and
content
during
early

in
European

)
.

A
likely
endocrine
control
mechanism
for
sexual
differentiation
in
size
-
graded
populations
of
European
sea
bass
(
Dicentrarchus
labrax
)
is
proposed
by
evaluating
the
brain
expression
and
pituitary
content
of
two
forms
of
gonadotropin
-
releasing
hormone
(
GnRH
)
,
namely
sea
bream
(
sbGnRH
)
and
salmon
(
sGnRH
)
,
the
pituitary
expression
of
one
subtype
of
GnRH
receptor
(
dlGnRH
-
R
-
2A
)
and
the
three
gonadotropin
(
GtH
)
subunits
,
namely
glycoprotein
alpha
(
GPalpha
)
,
follicle
-
stimulating
hormone
beta
(
FSHbeta
)
and
luteinizing
hormone
beta
(
LHbeta
)
,
as
well
as
the
pituitary
and
plasma
LH
levels
between
50
and
300
days
post
-
hatching
(
dph
)
.

Four
gradings
were
conducted
between
2
and
8
months
after
hatching
,
resulting
in
a
population
of
large
and
small
individuals
,
having
96
.
5
%
females
(
female
-
dominant
population
)
and
69
.
2
%
males
(
male
-
dominant
population
)
,
respectively
,
after
the
last
grading
.

The
onset
of
gonadal
differentiation
was
different
in
the
two
sexes
,
and
coincided
with
a
peak
of
expression
of
sbGnRH
or
sGnRH
.

Furthermore
,
the
expression
of
these
GnRHs
was
correlated
with
the
expression
of
dlGnRH
-
R
-
2A
.

Sex
-
related
differences
in
the
brain
and
pituitary
content
of
sbGnRH
were
also
found
at
the
time
of
sexual
differentiation
.

Moreover
,
the
observed
sexual
dimorphism
at
the
transcriptional
or
synthesis
level
of
these
GnRH
forms
suggests
that
a
different
neuro
-
hormonal
regulation
is
operating
according
to
sex
.

At
the
onset
of
sex
differentiation
,
FSHbeta
transcriptional
activity
reached
maximal
values
,
which
were
maintained
until
the
completion
of
the
process
.

The
present
study
suggests
a
role
for
sbGnRH
,
sGnRH
and
the
dlGnRH
-
R
-
2A
during
gonadal
differentiation
,
possibly
through
enhancement
of
FSHbeta
gene
expression
.

In
males
,
a
different
endocrine
regulation
seems
to
exist
also
during
spermiogenesis
and
spermiation
,
when
gene
transcription
,
peptide
synthesis
and
release
of
LH
are
of
greater
importance
.

Brugada
syndrome
.

A
novel
clinical
entity
characterized
by
ST
segment
elevation
in
right
precordial
leads
(
V1
to
V3
)
,
incomplete
or
complete
right
bundle
branch
block
,
and
susceptibility
to
ventricular
tachyarrhythmia
and
sudden
cardiac
death
has
been
described
by
Brugada
et
al
.
in
1992
.

This
disease
is
now
frequently
called
"
Brugada
syndrome
"
(
BrS
)
.

The
prevalence
of
BrS
in
the
general
population
is
unknown
.

The
suggested
prevalence
ranges
from
5
/
1
,
000
(
Caucasians
)
to
14
/

Syncope
,
typically
occurring
at
rest
or
during
sleep
(
in
individuals
in
their
third
or
fourth
decades
of
life
)
is
a
common
presentation
of
BrS
.

In
some
cases
,
tachycardia
does
not
terminate
spontaneously
and
it
may
degenerate
into
ventricular
fibrillation
and
lead
to
sudden
death
.

Both
sporadic
and
familial
cases
have
been
reported
and
pedigree
analysis
suggests
an
autosomal
dominant
pattern
of
inheritance
.

In
approximately
20
%
of
the
cases
BrS
is
caused
by
mutations
in
the
SCN5A
gene
on
chromosome
3p21
-
23
,
encoding
the
cardiac
sodium
channel
,
a
protein
involved
in
the
control
of
myocardial
excitability
.

Since
the
use
of
the
implantable
cardioverter
defibrillator
(
ICD
)
is
the
only
therapeutic
option
of
proven
efficacy
for
primary
and
secondary
prophylaxis
of
cardiac
arrest
,
the
identification
of
high
-
risk
subjects
is
one
of
the
major
goals
in
the
clinical
decision
-
making
process
.

Quinidine
may
be
regarded
as
an
adjunctive
therapy
for
patients
at
higher
risk
and
may
reduce
the
number
of
cases
of
ICD
shock
in
patients
with
multiple
recurrences
.

Relative
myotoxic
and
haemodynamic
effects
of
the
beta

The
beta
(

)
-
adrenoceptor
(
beta

)
-
AR
)
agonists
clenbuterol
and
fenoterol
have
similar
beneficial
effects
in
animal
models
of
heart
failure
.

However
,
large
doses
of
clenbuterol
can
induce
cardiomyocyte
death
,
and
it
is
not
known
which
of
these
agents
has
the
most
favourable
therapeutic
profile
.

We
have
investigated
the
cardiotoxicity
of
clenbuterol
and
fenoterol
alongside
that
of
isoprenaline
,
and
compared
their
haemodynamic
effects

In

the

Immunotherapy
for
De
Novo
renal
transplantation
:
what
'
s
in
the
pipeline
?

Immunosuppressive
drugs
have
been
traditionally
developed
to
prevent
acute
rejection
and
to
improve
short
-
term
kidney
transplant
outcomes
.

There
is
still
a
medical
need
to
improve
outcomes
among
subgroups
of
patients
at
higher
risk
for
graft
loss
and
to
reduce
cardiovascular
,
infectious
and
malignancy
-
associated
morbidity
and
mortality
,
and
improve
long
-
term
adherence
.

Several
new
immunosuppressive
agents
and
formulations
are
undergoing
clinical
investigation
and
are
discussed
in
this
review
.
A
modified
release
tacrolimus
formulation
(
MR4
)
for
once
-
daily
administration
is
undergoing
phase
III
trials
.

It
has
been
developed
to
be
administered
de
novo
or
for
maintenance
using
the
same
therapeutic
target
tacrolimus
trough
concentrations
as
for
the
original
formulation
.

Belatacept
(
LEA29Y
)
,
a
second
generation
cytotoxic
-
T
-
lymphocyte
-
associated
antigen
immunoglobulin
(
CTLA4
-
Ig
)
,
blocks
the
interaction
between
CD80
/
86
and
CD28
costimulatory
pathways
.

In
phase
II
trials
,
belatacept
was
as
effective
as
ciclosporin
(
cyclosporine
)
when
administered
in
combination
with
basiliximab
,
mycophenolate
mofetil
(
MMF
)
and
corticosteroids
.

Currently
,
belatacept
is
undergoing
phase
III
trials
including
one
study
in
recipients
of
organs
from
expanded
criteria
donors
.

Inhibitors
of
the
Janus
protein
tyrosine
kinase
(
JAK
)
-
3
show
some
selectivity
for
cells
of
the
lymphoid
lineage
and
have
been
shown
to
be
effective
in
late
preclinical
transplant
models
.

The
most
frequent
adverse
effects
have
been
related
to
nonspecific
binding
to
JAK2
kinases
.

CP
-

,
a
JAK3
inhibitor
is
currently
in
phase
II
clinical
trials
.
FK778
,
is
a
synthetic
malononitrilamide
that
targets
the
critical
enzyme
of
the
de
novo
pyrimidine
synthesis
,
dihydroorotic
acid
dehydrogenase
,
and
receptor
-
associated
tyrosine
kinases
has
completed
phase
II
trials
.

FK778
also
shows
antiviral
activities
that
have
been
tested
in
patients
with
polyomavirus
nephropathy
.

Fingolimod
(
FTY720
)
,
a
synthetic
sphingosine
phosphate
receptor
modulator
that
reduces
the
recirculation
of
lymphocytes
to
blood
and
peripheral
tissues
including
inflammatory
lesions
and
graft
sites
is
undergoing
phase
III
trials
.

Although
the
efficacy
of
fingolimod
is
similar
to
MMF
in
patients
receiving
full
doses
of
ciclosporin
,
safety
issues
such
as
a
negative
chronotropic
effect
,
macular
oedema
,
pulmonary
adverse
reactions
and
graft
function
resulted
in
premature
discontinuation
of
the
development
programme
for
kidney
transplantation
.

Because
there
was
no
clear
clinical
benefit
over
treatment
options
,
the
clinical
development
programme
of
FK778
was
discontinued
.
Finally
,
a
new
evolving
strategy
with
powerful
induction
-
induced
prolonged
T
-
cell
depletion
followed
by
low
-
dose
immunosuppressive
monotherapy
is
showing
promising
results
.

studies
on
the
prevention
of
heart
disease
by
estrogens
and
progestins
warrant
a
better
understanding
of
nuclear
hormone
receptor
function
and
interaction
.

To
address
this
issue
and
taking
into
account
that
effects
of
synthetic
progestins
are
not
only
referable
to
action
through
the
progesterone
receptor
but
may
also
be
mediated
by
other
steroid
receptors
,
we
characterized
cardiovascular
function
and
inflammatory
gene
expression
in
aldosterone
salt
-
treated
rats
on
long
-
term
administration
of
17beta
-
estradiol
,
medroxyprogesterone
acetate
,
and
drospirenone
,
a
new
progestogen
exhibiting
antimineralocorticoid
activity
.

The
complex
pattern
of
cardiovascular
injury
in
ovariectomized
Wistar
rats
induced
by
chronic
aldosterone
infusion
plus
a
high
-
salt
diet
was
significantly
attenuated
in
sham
-
ovariectomized
rats
and
by
coadministration
of
17beta
-
estradiol
in
ovariectomized
animals
after
8
weeks
of
continuous
treatment
.

The
beneficial
role
of
17beta
-
estradiol
on
blood
pressure
,
cardiac
hypertrophy
,
vascular
osteopontin
expression
,
perivascular
fibrosis
,
and
impaired
NO
-
dependent
relaxation
of
isolated
aortic
rings
was
completely
abrogated
by
coadministration
of
medroxyprogesterone
acetate
.

In
contrast
,
drospirenone
was
either
neutral
or
additive
to
17beta
-
estradiol
in
protecting
against
aldosterone
salt
-
induced
cardiovascular
injury
and
inflammation
.

The
current
results
support
the
hypothesis
of
complex
interactions
among
estrogen
,
progesterone
,
glucocorticoid
,
androgen
,
and
mineralocorticoid
receptor
signaling
in
cardiovascular
injury
and
inflammation
.

Novel
progestins
,
such
as
drospirenone
,
confer
superior
effects
compared
with
medroxyprogesterone
acetate
in
a
model
of
aldosterone
-
induced
heart
disease
because
of
its
antimineralocorticoid
properties
.

Licofelone
,
a
balanced
inhibitor
of
cyclooxygenase
and
5
-
lipoxygenase
,
reduces
inflammation
in
a
rabbit
model
of
atherosclerosis
.

Licofelone
,
a
dual
anti
-
inflammatory
drug
that
inhibits
5
-
lipoxygenase
(
LOX
)
and
cyclooxygenase
(
COX
)
enzymes
,
may
have
a
better
cardiovascular
profile
that
cycloxygenase
-
2
inhibitors
due
to
cycloxygenase
-
1
blockade
-
mediated
antithrombotic
effect
and
a
better
gastrointestinal
tolerability
.

We
examined
the
anti
-
inflammatory
effect
of
licofelone
on
atherosclerotic
lesions
as
well
as
in
isolated
neutrophils
from
whole
blood
of
rabbits
compared
with
a
selective
inhibitor
of
COX
-
2
,
rofecoxib
.

We
also
assessed
the
antithrombotic
effect
of
licofelone
in
rabbit
platelet
-
rich
plasma
.

For
this
purpose
,
30
rabbits
underwent
injury
of
femoral
arteries
,
and
they
were
randomized
to
receive
10
mg
/
kg
/
day
licofelone
or
5
mg
/
kg
/
day
rofecoxib
or
no
treatment
during
4
weeks
with
atherogenic
diet
in
all
cases
.

Ten
healthy
rabbits
were
used
as
controls
.

Neutrophils
and
platelets
were
isolated
from
peripheral
blood
of
rabbits
for
ex
vivo
studies
.

Licofelone
reduced
intima
/
media
ratio
in
injured
arteries
,
the
macrophages
infiltration
in
the
neointimal
area
,
monocyte
chemoattractant
protein
-
1
(
MCP
-
1
)
gene
expression
,
and
the
activation
of
nuclear
factor
-
kappaB
in
rabbit
atheroma
.

Moreover
,
licofelone
inhibited
COX
-
2
and
5
-
LOX
protein
expression
in
vascular
lesions
.

Rofecoxib
only
diminished
COX
-
2
protein
expression
and
MCP
-
1
gene
expression
in
vascular
atheroma
.

Prostaglandin
E
(
2
)
in
rabbit
plasma
was
attenuated
by
both
drugs
.

Licofelone
almost
abolished
5
-
LOX
activity
by
inhibiting
leukotriene
B4
generation
in
rabbit
neutrophils
and
prevented
platelet
thromboxane
B2
production
from
whole
blood
.

Licofelone
reduces
neointimal
formation
and
inflammation
in
an
atherosclerotic
rabbit
model
more
markedly
than
rofecoxib
.

This
effect
,
together
with
the
antiplatelet
activity
of
licofelone
,
suggests
that
this
drug
may
have
a
favorable
cardiovascular
profile
.

Different
responses
to
dexamethasone
and
prednisolone
in
the
same
depressed
patients
.

RATIONALE
:
Patients
with
major
depression
show
hypothalamic
-
pituitary
-
adrenal
(
HPA
)
axis
hyperactivity
,
but
the
mechanisms
underlying
this
abnormality
are
still
unclear
.

OBJECTIVES
:
We
have
compared
two
synthetic
glucorticoids
,
dexamethasone
and
prednisolone
,
in
their
ability
to
suppress
the
hypothalamic
-
pituitary
-
adrenal
(
HPA
)
axis
in
depressed
patients
.

Dexamethasone
probes
glucocorticoid
receptor
(
GR
)
function
,
while
prednisolone
probes
both
GR
and
mineralocorticoid
receptor
(
MR
)
function
.

MATERIALS
AND
METHODS
:
We
used
a
single
-
blind
,
repeated
-
measure
design
.

We
administered
placebo
,
prednisolone
(
5
mg
)
or
dexamethasone
(
0
.
5
mg
)
,
at
22
:
00
,
to
18
severe
,
treatment
-
resistant
depressed
inpatients
(
15
of
them
with
a
history
of
childhood
trauma
)
and
14
healthy
volunteers
.

On
the
following
days
,
we
collected
salivary
cortisol
from
9
:
00
to
22
:
00
.

RESULTS
:
Depressed
patients
had
higher
salivary
cortisol
levels
compared
with
controls
,
at
baseline
and
after
both
prednisolone
and
dexamethasone
(
p
<
0
.
001
)
.

Consistent
with
previous
studies
,
depressed
inpatients
showed
impaired
suppression
by
dexamethasone
:
based
on
the
analysis
of
the
areas
under
the
curve
(
AUCs
)
,
suppression
by
dexamethasone
(
0
.
5
mg
)
was
-
85
%
in
controls
vs
-
46
%
in
depressed
patients
(
p
=
0
.
018
)
.

However
,
the
same
depressed
patients
showed
normal
suppression
by
prednisolone
(
5
mg
)
:
suppression
was
-
41
%
in
controls
and
-
36
%
in
depressed
patients
(
p
=
0
.
6
)
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
We
suggest
that
the
additional
effects
of
prednisolone
on
the
MR
explain
the
different
responses
to
these
glucocorticoids
in
the
same
depressed
patients
.

Characterization
of
the
regulation
of
renal
Na
+
/
H
+
exchanger
NHE3
by
insulin
.

Insulin
receptors
are
widely
distributed
in
the
kidney
and
affect
multiple
aspects
of
renal
function
.

In
the
proximal
tubule
,
insulin
regulates
volume
and
acid
-
base
regulation
through
stimulation
of
the
Na
(
+
)
/
H
(
+
)
exchanger
NHE3
.

This
paper
characterizes
the
signaling
pathway
by
which
insulin
stimulates
NHE3
in
a
cell
culture
model
[
opossum
kidney
(
OK
)
cell
]
.

Insulin
has
two
distinct
phases
of
action
on
NHE3
.

Chronic
insulin
(
24
h
)
activates
NHE3
through
the
classic
phosphatidylinositol
3
-
kinase
-
serum
-
and
glucocorticoid
-
dependent
kinase
1
(
PI3K
-
SGK1
)
pathway
as
insulin
stimulates
SGK1
phosphorylation
and
the
insulin
effect
can
be
blocked
by
the
PI3K
inhibitor
wortmannin
or
a
dominant
-
negative
SGK1
.

We
showed
that
SGK1
transcript
and
protein
are
expressed
in
rat
proximal
tubule
and
OK
cells
.

We
previously
showed
that
glucocorticoids
augment
the
effect
of
insulin
on
NHE3
(

,

)
.

Part
of
this
can
be
mediated
via
induction
of
SGK1
by
glucocorticoids
,
and
indeed
the
insulin
effect
on
NHE3
can
also
be
amplified
by
overexpression
of
SGK1
.

We
next
addressed
the
acute
effect
of
insulin
(
1
-
2
h
)
on
NHE3
by
systematically
examining
the
candidate
signaling
cascades
and
activation
mechanisms
of
NHE3
.

We
ruled
out
the
PI3K
-
SGK1
-
Akt
and
TC10
pathways
,
increased
surface
NHE3
,
NHE3
phosphorylation
,
NHE3
association
with
calcineurin
homologous
protein
1
or
megalin
as
mechanisms
of
acute
activation
of
NHE3
by
insulin
.

In
summary
,
insulin
stimulates
NHE3
acutely
via
yet
undefined
pathways
and
mechanisms
.

The
chronic
effect
of
insulin
is
mediated
by
the
classic
PI3K
-
SGK1
route
.

Update
on
the
use
of
aromatase
inhibitors
in
breast
cancer
.

Estrogens
are
biosynthesised
from
androgens
by
the
CYP450
enzyme
complex
called
aromatase
.

Aromatase
is
expressed
in
the
ovary
,
placenta
,
brain
,
bone
,
adipose
tissue
and
breast
tissue
.

In
breast
cancer
,
intratumoural
aromatase
is
the
source
for
local
estrogen
production
in
the
tissue
.

Inhibition
of
aromatase
is
an
important
approach
for
reducing
growth
stimulatory
effects
of
estrogens
in
estrogen
-
dependent
breast
cancer
.

The
potent
and
selective
third
-
generation
aromatase
inhibitors
anastrozole
,
letrozole
and
exemestane
were
introduced
to
the
market
as
endocrine
therapy
in
postmenopausal
patients
failing
anti
-
estrogen
therapy
alone
,
or
multiple
hormonal
therapies
.

Anastrozole
and
letrozole
are
both
non
-
steroidal
aromatase
inhibitors
that
compete
with
the
substrate
for
binding
to
the
enzyme
active
site
.

Exemestane
is
a
mechanism
-
based
steroidal
inhibitor
that
mimics
the
substrate
,
is
converted
by
the
enzyme
to
a
reactive
intermediate
,
and
results
in
inactivation
of
aromatase
.

These
third
-
generation
aromatase
inhibitors
are
currently
approved
as
first
-
line
therapy
for
the
treatment
of
postmenopausal
women
with
metastatic
estrogen
-
dependent
breast
cancer
.

The
use
of
an
aromatase
inhibitor
as
initial
therapy
,
or
after
treatment
with
tamoxifen
,
is
now
recommended
as
adjuvant
hormonal
therapy
for
postmenopausal
women
with
hormone
-
dependent
breast
cancer
.

Several
clinical
studies
of
aromatase
inhibitors
focus
on
the
use
of
these
agents
in
the
adjuvant
setting
,
for
the
treatment
of
early
breast
cancer
.

Recently
published
results
show
improved
responses
with
these
agents
compared
with
tamoxifen
.

Interferon
-
gamma
is
causatively
involved
in
experimental
inflammatory
bowel
disease
in
mice
.

Cytokines
may
be
crucially
involved
in
the
pathogenesis
of
inflammatory
bowel
diseases
(
IBD
)
,
but
it
remains
controversial
whether
interferon
(
IFN
)
-
gamma
,
a
typical
proinflammatory
cytokine
,
is
an
essential
mediator
to
cause
the
disorders
.

In
the
present
study
,
IFN
-
gamma
(
-
/
-
)
and
wild
-
type
(
WT
)
C57BL
/
6
mice
were
fed
2
.
5
%
dextran
sodium
sulphate
(
DSS
)
in
drinking
water
for
7
days
,
in
order
to
investigate
DSS
-
induced
intestinal
inflammation
.

The
DSS
-
treated
WT
mice
exhibited
a
robust
production
of
IFN
-
gamma
in
the
gut
,
a
remarkable
loss
of
body
weight
,
as
well
as
high
rate
of
mortality
(
60
%
)
.

In
striking
contrast
,
IFN
-
gamma
deficient
mice
did
not
develop
DSS
-
induced
colitis
,
as
indicated
by
the
maintenance
of
body
weight
and
survival
rate
of
100
%
.

Severe
intestinal
inflammation
was
demonstrated
exclusively
in
WT
animals
in
terms
of
the
shortening
of
the
bowel
as
well
as
the
elevation
of
the
disease
activity
index
,
myeloperoxidase
(
MPO
)
activity
and
serum
haptoglobin
level
.

Histological
study
of
DSS
-
treated
WT
intestine
revealed
disruption
of
mucosal
epithelium
and
massive
infiltration
of
inflammatory
cells
,
while
the
organ
from
IFN
-
gamma
(
-
/
-
)
mice
remained
virtually
normal
in
appearance
.

Enzyme
-
linked
immunosorbent
assay
(
ELISA
)
analyses
indicated
abundant
production
of
three
chemokines
,
i
.
e
.
monokine
induced
by
interferon

gamma
(
MIG
)
,
interferon

(

)
and
monocyte
chemoattractant
protein

(

)
,
in
the
DSS
-
irritated
intestine
of
WT
but
not
of
IFN
-
gamma
(
-
/
-
)
mice
.

The
present
results
demonstrate
clearly
that
IFN
-
gamma
plays
indispensable
roles
in
the
initiation
of
DSS
colitis
,
and
some
chemokines
are
produced
in
an
IFN

gamma
-
dependent
fashion
.

Auranofin
,
as
an
anti
-
rheumatic
gold
compound
,
suppresses
LPS
-
induced
homodimerization
of
TLR4
.

Toll
-
like
receptors
(
TLRs
)
,
which
are
activated
by
invading
microorganisms
or
endogenous
molecules
,
evoke
immune
and
inflammatory
responses
.

TLR
activation
is
closely
linked
to
the
development
of
many
chronic
inflammatory
diseases
including
rheumatoid
arthritis
.

Auranofin
,
an
Au
(
I
)
compound
,
is
a
well
-
known
and
long
-
used
anti
-
rheumatic
drug
.

However
,
the
mechanism
as
to
how
auranofin
relieves
the
symptom
of
rheumatoid
arthritis
has
not
been
fully
clarified
.

Our
results
demonstrated
that
auranofin
suppressed
TLR4
-
mediated
activation
of
transcription
factors
,
NF
-
kappaB
and
IRF3
,
and
expression
of
COX
-
2
,
a
pro
-
inflammatory
enzyme
.

This
suppression
was
well
correlated
with
the
inhibitory
effect
of
auranofin
on
the
homodimerization
of
TLR4
induced
by
an
agonist
.

Furthermore
,
auranofin
inhibited
NF
-
kappaB
activation
induced
by
MyD88
-
dependent
downstream
signaling
components
of
TLR4
,
MyD88
,
IKKbeta
,
and
p65
.

IRF3
activation
induced
by
MyD88
-
independent
signaling
components
,
TRIF
and
TBK1
,
was
also
downregulated
by
auranofin
.

Our
results
first
demonstrate
that
auranofin
suppresses
the
multiple
steps
in
TLR4
signaling
,
especially
the
homodimerization
of
TLR4
.

The
results
suggest
that
the
suppression
of
TLR4
activity
by
auranofin
may
be
the
molecular
mechanism
through
which
auranofin
exerts
anti
-
rheumatic
activity
.

Neural

defects
and
folate
pathway
genes
:
family
-
based
association
tests
of
gene
-
gene
and
gene
-
environment
interactions
.

BACKGROUND
:
Folate
metabolism
pathway
genes
have
been
examined
for
association
with
neural
tube
defects
(
NTDs
)
because
folic
acid
supplementation
reduces
the
risk
of
this
debilitating
birth
defect
.

Most
studies
addressed
these
genes
individually
,
often
with
different
populations
providing
conflicting
results
.

OBJECTIVES
:
Our
study
evaluates
several
folate
pathway
genes
for
association
with
human
NTDs
,
incorporating
an
environmental
cofactor
:
maternal
folate
supplementation
.

METHODS
:
In
304
Caucasian
American
NTD
families
with
myelomeningocele
or
anencephaly
,
we
examined
28
polymorphisms
in
11
genes
:
folate
receptor
1
,
folate
receptor
2
,
solute
carrier
family
19
member

,
transcobalamin

,
methylenetetrahydrofolate

methyltransferase
reductase
,
betaine
-
homocysteine
methyltransferase
(
BHMT
)
,
and
cystathionine
-
beta
-
synthase
.

RESULTS
:
Only
single
nucleotide
polymorphisms
(
SNPs
)
in
BHMT
were
significantly
associated
in
the
overall
data
set
;
this
significance
was
strongest
when
mothers
took
folate
-
containing
nutritional
supplements
before
conception
.

The
BHMT
SNP
rs3733890
was
more
significant
when
the
data
were
stratified
by
preferential
transmission
of
the
MTHFR
rs1801133
thermolabile
T
allele
from
parent
to
offspring
.

Other
SNPs
in
folate
pathway
genes
were
marginally
significant
in
some
analyses
when
stratified
by
maternal
supplementation
,
MTHFR
,
or
BHMT
allele
transmission
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
BHMT
rs3733890
is
significantly
associated
in
our
data
set
,
whereas
MTHFR
rs1801133
is
not
a
major
risk
factor
.

Further
investigation
of
folate
and
methionine
cycle
genes
will
require
extensive
SNP
genotyping
and
/
or
resequencing
to
identify
novel
variants
,
inclusion
of
environmental
factors
,
and
investigation
of
gene
-
gene
interactions
in
large
data
sets
.

Functional
analyses

disease
type
2D
(
CMT2D
)
and
distal
spinal
muscular
atrophy
type
V
(
dSMA
-
V
)
are
axonal
neuropathies
characterized
by
a
phenotype
that
is
more
severe
in
the
upper
extremities
.

We
previously
implicated
mutations
in
the
gene
encoding
glycyl
-
tRNA
synthetase
(
GARS
)
as
the
cause
of
CMT2D
and
dSMA
-
V
.

GARS
is
a
member
of
the
family
of
aminoacyl
-
tRNA
synthetases
responsible
for
charging
tRNA
with
cognate
amino
acids
;
GARS
ligates
glycine
to
tRNA
(
Gly
)
.

Here
,
we
present
functional
analyses
of
disease
-
associated
GARS
mutations
and
show
that
there
are
not
any
significant
mutation
-
associated
changes
in
GARS
expression
levels
;
that
the
majority
of
identified
GARS
mutations
modeled
in
yeast
severely
impair
viability
;
and
that
,
in
most
cases
,
mutant
GARS
protein
mislocalizes
in
neuronal
cells
.

Indeed
,
four
of
the
five
mutations
studied
show
loss
-
of
-
function
features
in
at
least
one
assay
,
suggesting
that
tRNA
-
charging
deficits
play
a
role
in
disease
pathogenesis
.

Finally
,
we
detected
endogenous
GARS
-
associated
granules
in
the
neurite
projections
of
cultured
neurons
and
in
the
peripheral
nerve
axons
of
normal
human
tissue
.

These
data
are
particularly
important
in
light
of
the
recent
identification
of
CMT
-
associated
mutations
in
another
tRNA
synthetase
gene
[
YARS
(
tyrosyl
-
tRNA
synthetase
gene
)
]
.

Together
,
these
findings
suggest
that
tRNA
-
charging
enzymes
play
a
key
role
in
maintaining
peripheral
axons
.

Reductive
detoxification
of
arylhydroxylamine
carcinogens
by
human
NADH
cytochrome
b5
reductase
and
cytochrome
b5
.

Heterocyclic
and
aromatic
amine
carcinogens
are
thought
to
lead
to
tumor
initiation
via
the
formation
of
DNA
adducts
,
and
bioactivation
to
arylhydroxylamine
metabolites
is
necessary
for
reactivity
with
DNA
.

Carcinogenic
arylhydroxylamine
metabolites
are
cleared
by
a
microsomal
,
NADH
-
dependent
,
oxygen
-
insensitive
reduction
pathway
in
humans
,
which
may
be
a
source
of
interindividual
variability
in
response
to
aromatic
amine
carcinogens
.

The
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
characterize
the
identity
of
this
reduction
pathway
in
human
liver
.

On
the
basis
of
our
findings
with
structurally
similar
arylhydroxylamine
metabolites
of
therapeutic
drugs
,
we
hypothesized
that
the
reductive
detoxification
of
arylhydroxylamine
carcinogens
was
catalyzed
by
NADH
cytochrome
b5
reductase
(
b5R
)
and
cytochrome
b5
(
cyt
b5
)
.

We
found
that
reduction
of
the
carcinogenic
hydroxylamines
of
the
aromatic
amine
4
-
aminobiphenyl
(
4
-
ABP
;
found
in
cigarette
smoke
)
and
the
heterocyclic
amine
2
-
amino
-
1
-
methyl
-
6
-
phenylimidazo
[
4
,
5
-
b
]
pyridine
(
PhIP
;
found
in
grilled
meats
)
was
indeed
catalyzed
by
a
purified
system
containing
only
human
b5R
and
cyt
b5
.

Specific
activities
were
56
-
346
-
fold
higher
in
the
purified
system
as
compared
to
human
liver
microsomes
(
HLM
)
,
with
similar
Michaelis
-
Menten
constants
(
K
(
m
)
values
)
in
both
systems
.

The
stoichiometry
for
b5R
and
cyt
b5
that
yielded
the
highest
activity
in
the
purified
system
was
also
similar
to
that
found
in
native
HLM
(
approximately
1
:
8
to
1
:
10
)
.

Polyclonal
antisera
to
either
b5R
or
cyt
b5
significantly
inhibited
N
-
hydroxy
-
4
-
aminobiphenyl
(
NHOH
-
4
-
ABP
)
reduction
by
95
and
89
%
,
respectively
,
and
immunoreactive
cyt
b5
protein
content
in
individual
HLM
was
significantly
correlated
with
individual
reduction
of
both
NHOH
-
4
-
ABP
and
N
-
hydroxy
-
PhIP
(
NHOH
-
PhIP
)
.

Finally
,
titration
of
HLM
into
the
purified
b5R
/
cyt
b5
system
did
not
enhance
the
efficiency
of
reduction
activity
.

We
conclude
that
b5R
and
cyt
b5
are
together
solely
capable
of
the
reduction
of
arylhydroxylamine
carcinogens
,
and
we
further
hypothesize
that
this
pathway
may
be
a
source
of
individual
variability
with
respect
to
cancer
susceptibility
following
4
-
ABP
or
PhIP
exposure
.

Imatinib
mesylate
(
Gleevec
)
enhances
mature
osteoclast
apoptosis
and
suppresses
osteoclast
bone
resorbing
activity
.

Recent
studies
have
reported
that
imatinib
mesylate
,
a
kinase
inhibitor
that
targets
the
intracellular
tyrosine
kinase
BCR
-
ABL
and
the
platelet
derived
growth
factor
(
PDGF
)
receptor
,
is
an
effective
inhibitor
of
the
macrophage
colony
stimulating
factor
(
M
-
CSF
)
receptor
,
c
-
FMS
.

Given
that
M
-
CSF
signalling
through
c
-
FMS
plays
an
important
role
in
osteoclast
biology
,
we
speculated
that
blocking
such
a
pathway
with
imatinib
may
modulate
osteoclast
activity
.

Using
a
cell
model
of
mature
rabbit
osteoclasts
,
we
thus
investigated
the
effect
of
imatinib
on
in
vitro
osteoclast
apoptosis
and
bone
resorbing
activity
.

Our
findings
demonstrate
that
imatinib
dose
-
dependently
stimulates
osteoclast
apoptosis
,
a
phenomenon
which
is
blocked
by
the
caspase
I
inhibitor
Z
-
VAD
-
fmk
.

The
ability
of
imatinib
to
enhance
osteoclast
cell
death
was
accompanied
by
a
dose
-
dependent
inhibition
of
osteoclast
bone
resorbing
activity
.

Imatinib
was
also
found
to
inhibit
M
-
CSF
-
induced
osteoclast
survival
as
well
as
M
-
CSF
-
induced
osteoclast
bone
resorbing
activity
,
but
was
without
effect
on
interleukin
1alpha
(
IL
-
1alpha
)
and
receptor
activator
of
nuclear
factor
kappa
B
ligand
(
RANKL
)
-
induced
inhibition
of
osteoclasts
apoptosis
,
further
supporting
the
hypothesis
that
imatinib
may
affect
mature
osteoclasts
through
the
inhibition
of
c
-
FMS
.

Taken
together
,
these
results
suggest
that
imatinib
could
be
of
clinical
value
in
treating
diseases
where
bone
destruction
can
occur
due
to
excessive
M
-
CSF
production
such
as
osteoporosis
,
inflammatory
-
and
tumor
-
induced
osteolysis
.

Compared
with

,
both

decreased
the

.

The
overall
fall
in

Clinical
pharmacology
of
enalkiren
,
a
novel
,
dipeptide
renin
inhibitor
.

Enalkiren
(
A
-
64662
)
,
a
potent
,
dipeptide
renin
inhibitor
,
mimics
the
transition
state
of
the
human
renin
substrate
,
angiotensinogen
.

Enalkiren
has
been
shown
to
produce
dose
-
related
suppression
of
plasma
renin
activity
(
PRA
)
and
angiotensin
II
when
administered
intravenously
.

Doses
of
enalkiren
of
less
than
0
.
1
mg
/
kg
induced
little
hemodynamic
response
in
normotensive
and
hypertensive
volunteers
despite
marked
suppression
of
PRA
.

However
,
at
doses
of
0
.
3
and
1
.
2
mg
/
kg
,
enalkiren
produced
significant
,
dose
-
related
decreases
in
systolic
and
diastolic
blood
pressure
(
BP
)
in
hypertensive
patients
,
and
the
BP
response
was
enhanced
by
pretreatment
with
hydrochlorothiazide
.

The
effects
of
enalkiren
on
PRA
and
BP
are
prolonged
despite
its
relatively
short
elimination
phase
plasma
half
-
life
(
1
.
6
h
)
.

Persistent
pharmacologic
activity
without
evidence
of
tachyphylaxis
was
demonstrated
during
1
week
of
treatment
in
hypertensive
patients
.

The
observed
dissociation
between
suppression
of
PRA
and
BP
response
and
the
recruitment
of
dose
-
related
BP
decrements
,
despite
complete
suppression
of
PRA
,
are
unexplained
phenomena
.

The
results
of
clinical
trials
with
enalkiren
are
encouraging
,
and
suggest
that
renin
inhibitors
may
be
safe
,
useful
therapeutic
agents
in
the
management
of
hypertension
.

Dopamine
D2
receptor
occupancy
by
risperidone
:
implications
for
the
timing
and
magnitude
of
clinical
response
.

The
objective
of
the
study
is
to
investigate
whether
dopamine
D2
receptor
occupancy
by
risperidone
and
plasma
levels
over
time
can
account
for
therapeutic
efficacy
and
the
latency
period
to
response
.

Thirty
-
eight
examinations
with
(
123
)
I
-
IBZM
single
photon
emission
computed
tomography
were
performed
on
22
patients
with
schizophrenia
,
at
diagnosis
,
48
h
after
starting
risperidone
treatment
and
at
a
stable
dose
.

Risperidone
plasma
levels
were
determined
and
psychopathologic
evaluations
(
Brief
Psychiatric
Rating
Scale
,
Positive
and
Negative
Syndrome
Scale
)
were
carried
out
.

No
differences
in
the
striatal
/
occipital
(
S
/
O
)
ratio
or
plasma
levels
were
found
between
examinations
at
the
48
-
h
time
point
and
when
a
stable
dose
level
had
been
established
,
so
these
parameters
could
not
account
for
the
latency
period
required
for
clinical
response
.

D2
receptor
occupancy
at
48
h
correlated
positively
with
clinical
improvement
after
2
weeks
of
treatment
.

Therefore
,
if
these
results
are
confirmed
,
D2
receptor
occupancy
at
the
beginning
of
treatment
with
risperidone
may
be
a
predictor
of
subsequent
clinical
response
.

Treatment
-
related
osteoporosis
in
men
with
prostate
cancer
.

The
intended
therapeutic
effect
of
gonadotropin
-
releasing
hormone
(
GnRH
)
agonists
is
hypogonadism
,
a
major
cause
of
acquired
osteoporosis
in
men
.

Consistent
with
this
observation
,
GnRH
agonists
increase
bone
turnover
and
decrease
bone
mineral
density
,
a
surrogate
for
fracture
risk
.

Large
claims
-
based
analyses
and
other
retrospective
studies
provide
compelling
evidence
that
GnRH
agonists
increase
risk
of
clinical
fractures
.

Estrogens
play
a
central
role
in
homeostasis
of
the
normal
male
skeleton
,
and
estrogen
deficiency
rather
than
testosterone
deficiency
seems
to
be
primarily
responsible
for
the
adverse
skeletal
effects
of
GnRH
agonists
.

In
randomized
controlled
trials
,
bisphosphonates
(
pamidronate
and
zoledronic
acid
)
and
selective
estrogen
receptor
modulators
(
raloxifene
and
toremifene
)
increased
bone
mineral
density
in
GnRH
agonist
-
treated
men
.

Two
ongoing
large
randomized
placebo
-
controlled
studies
will
prospectively
define
fracture
outcomes
in
men
with
prostate
cancer
and
assess
the
efficacy
of
novel
pharmacologic
interventions
(

)
during
GnRH

The
effects
of
adulthood
olanzapine
treatment
on
cognitive
performance
and
neurotrophic
factor
content
in
male
and
female
rats
neonatally
treated
with
quinpirole
.

Male
and
female
Sprague
-
Dawley
rats
were
administered
quinpirole
(
1
mg
/
kg
,
i
.
p
.
)
or
saline
once
daily
from
postnatal
day
(
P
)
1
to
P21
.

This
drug
treatment
has
been
shown
to
produce
long
-
term
priming
of
the
D2
receptor
.

Beginning
on
P62
,
rats
were
administered
the
atypical
antipsychotic
olanzapine
(
2
.
5
mg
/
kg
)
or
saline
twice
daily
(
i
.
p
.
)
for
28
days
.

One
day
after
olanzapine
treatment
ceased
,
rats
were
tested
on
the
place
and
match
-
to
-
place
versions
of
the
Morris
water
maze
(
MWM
)
for
seven
consecutive
days
.

Dopamine
D2
receptor
priming
was
verified
through
a
yawning
behavioural
test
,
a
D2
receptor
-
mediated
event
,
before
olanzapine
was
administered
as
well
as
after
olanzapine
treatment
and
behavioural
testing
were
complete
.

Results
showed
that
neonatal
quinpirole
treatment
induced
D2
priming
that
was
eliminated
by
olanzapine
treatment
.

On
the
MWM
place
version
,
D2
-
primed
rats
demonstrated
a
significant
impairment
that
was
eliminated
by
olanzapine
treatment
,
but
olanzapine
treatment
to
animals
neonatally
treated
with
saline
produced
a
significant
deficit
on
the
place
version
of
the
MWM
.

There
were
no
significant
deficits
on
the
match
-
to
-
place
version
.

Brain
tissue
analyses
revealed
that
neonatal
quinpirole
treatment
produced
a
significant
decrease
in
hippocampal
NGF
,
BDNF
and
ChAT
that
was
eliminated
by
olanzapine
treatment
.

Neonatal
quinpirole
treatment
produced
a
significant
decrease
in
BDNF
and
ChAT
in
the
frontal
cortex
that
was
unaffected
by
olanzapine
treatment
.

These
results
show
that
olanzapine
eliminates
D2
receptor
priming
and
cognitive
impairment
and
also
alleviates
decreases
in
neurotrophins
and
acetylcholinergic
markers
produced
by
D2
priming
in
the
hippocampus
.

Dexamethasone
suppresses
histamine
synthesis
by
repressing
both
transcription
and
activity
of
HDC
in
allergic
rats
.

BACKGROUND
:
Histamine
synthesized
by
histidine
decarboxylase
(
HDC
)
from
L
-
histidine
is
a
major
chemical
mediator
in
the
development
of
nasal
allergy
which
is
characterized
by
nasal
hypersensitivity
.

However
the
regulatory
mechanism
of
histamine
synthesis
by
HDC
remains
to
be
elucidated
.

The
objectives
of
the
present
study
were
to
examine
the
changes
of
histamine
content
,
HDC
activity
and
HDC
mRNA
expression
in
the
nasal
mucosa
of
allergy
model
rats
sensitized
by
the
exposure
to
toluene
diisocyanate
(
TDI
)
and
to
investigate
the
effect
of
dexamethasone
on
the
above
mentioned
allergic
parameters
.

METHODS
:
Rats
were
sensitized
and
provocated
by
TDI
and
the
nasal
allergy
-
like
behaviors
were
scored
during
a
10
minute
period
after
provocation
.

Histamine
content
and
HDC
activity
in
the
nasal
mucosa
were
determined
using
fluorometric
high
performance
liquid
chromatography
.

The
expression
of
HDC
mRNA
in
nasal
mucosa
was
determined
using
real
-
time
quantitative
reverse
transcriptase
-
polymerase
chain
reaction
(
RT
-
PCR
)
.

RESULTS
:
In
TDI
-
sensitized
rats
,
nasal
allergy
-
like
behaviors
such
as
sneezing
and
watery
rhinorrhea
were
induced
.

Histamine
content
,
HDC
activity
and
HDC
mRNA
expression
in
nasal
mucosa
were
also
significantly
increased
after
TDI
provocation
.

Pretreatment
with
dexamethasone
significantly
suppressed
nasal
allergy
-
like
behaviors
,
up
-
regulation
of
histamine
content
,
HDC
activity
and
HDC
mRNA
induced
by
TDI
in
TDI
-
sensitized
rats
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
These
findings
indicate
that
increased
synthesis
of
histamine
through
up
-
regulation
of
HDC
gene
expression
and
HDC
activity
in
nasal
mucosa
plays
an
important
role
in
the
development
of
nasal
hypersensitivity
.

Repression
of
HDC
gene
expression
and
HDC
activity
by
dexamethasone
may
underlie
its
therapeutic
effect
in
the
treatment
of
allergy

Methionine
synthase
reductase
polymorphisms
are
associated
with
serum
osteocalcin
levels
in
postmenopausal
women
.

Homocysteine
(
Hcy
)
is
thought
to
play
an
important
role
in
the
development
of
osteoporosis
and
fracture
.

Methionine
synthase
reductase
(
MTRR
)
is
an
enzyme
involved
in
the
conversion
of
Hcy
to
methionine
.

We
hypothesized
that
certain
genetic
polymorphisms
of
MTRR
leading
to
reduced
enzyme
activity
may
cause
hyperhomocysteinemia
and
affect
bone
metabolism
.

We
therefore
examined
the
associations
of
the
A66G
and
C524T
polymorphisms
of
the
MTRR
gene
with
bone
mineral
density
(
BMD
)
and
serum
osteocalcin
levels
in
postmenopausal
women
.

Although
we
did
not
detect
any
significant
associations
between
MTRR
polymorphisms
and
BMD
or
serum
osteocalcin
levels
,
we
found
that
the
66G
/
524C
haplotype
,
which
has
reduced
enzyme
activity
,
was
significantly
associated
with
serum
osteocalcin
levels
in
a
gene
-
dose
dependent
manner
(
P
=
0
.
002
)
.

That
is
,
the
highest
osteocalcin
levels
(
34
.
5
+
/
-
16
.
8
ng
/
ml
)
were
observed
in
subjects
bearing
two
copies
,
intermediate
osteocalcin
levels
(
32
.
6
+
/
-
14
.
4
ng
/
ml
)
were
observed
in
subjects
bearing
one
copy
,
and
the
lowest
levels
of
osteocalcin
(
28
.
8
+
/
-
10
.
9
ng
/
ml
)
were
observed
in
subjects
bearing
no
copies
.

These
results
suggest
that
the
66G
/
524C
haplotype
of
the
MTRR
gene
affect
bone
turn
over
rate
.

Glutathione
peroxidases
and
redox
-
regulated
transcription
factors
.

Analysis
of
the
selenoproteome
identified
five
glutathione
peroxidases
(
GPxs
)
in
mammals
:
cytosolic
GPx
(
cGPx
,
GPx1
)
,
phospholipid
hydroperoxide
GPx
(
PHGPX
,
GPx4
)
,
plasma
GPx
(
pGPX
,
GPx3
)
,
gastrointestinal
GPx
(
GI
-
GPx
,
GPx2
)
and
,
in
humans
,
GPx6
,
which
is
restricted
to
the
olfactory
system
.

GPxs
reduce
hydroperoxides
to
the
corresponding
alcohols
by
means
of
glutathione
(
GSH
)
.

They
have
long
been
considered
to
only
act
as
antioxidant
enzymes
.

Increasing
evidence
,
however
,
suggests
that
nature
has
not
created
redundant
GPxs
just
to
detoxify
hydroperoxides
.

cGPx
clearly
acts
as
an
antioxidant
,
as
convincingly
demonstrated
in
GPx1
-
knockout
mice
.

PHGPx
specifically
interferes
with
NF
-
kappaB
activation
by
interleukin
-
1
,
reduces
leukotriene
and
prostanoid
biosynthesis
,
prevents
COX
-
2
expression
,
and
is
indispensable
for
sperm
maturation
and
embryogenesis
.

GI
-
GPx
,
which
is
not
exclusively
expressed
in
the
gastrointestinal
system
,
is
upregulated
in
colon
and
skin
cancers
and
in
certain
cultured
cancer
cells
.

GI
-
GPx
is
a
target
for
Nrf2
,
and
thus
is
part
of
the
adaptive
response
by
itself
,
while
PHGPx
might
prevent
cancer
by
interfering
with
inflammatory
pathways
.

In
conclusion
,
cGPx
,
PHGPx
and
GI
-
GPx
have
distinct
roles
,
particularly
in
cellular
defence
mechanisms
.

Redox
sensing
and
redox
regulation
of
metabolic
events
have
become
attractive
paradigms
to
unravel
the
specific
and
in
part
still
enigmatic
roles
of
GPxs
.

Adenosine
receptor
antagonists
intensify
the
benzodiazepine
withdrawal
signs
in
mice
.

The
aim
of
the
present
experiment
was
to
assess
the
involvement
of
adenosine
receptor
antagonists
in
benzodiazepine
(
BDZ
)
withdrawal
signs
,
observed
as
the
seizure
susceptibility
in
mice
.

The
discontinuation
of
chronic
treatment
with
temazepam
or
diazepam
decreased
seizure
threshold
(
one
of
BDZ
withdrawal
signs
)
.

The
concomitant
application
of
subconvulsive
dose
of
pentetrazole
(
55
.
0
mg
/
kg
)
with
low
dose
of
flumazenil
(
5
.
0
mg
/
kg
)
-
a
BDZ
receptor
antagonist
,
immediately
induced
BDZ
withdrawal
signs
in
these
animals
.

The
non
-
selective
adenosine
receptor
antagonist
(
caffeine
)
,
and
the
selective
adenosine
A1
receptor
antagonist
(
DPCPX
)
,
injected
15
min
before
the
application
of
pentetrazole
and
flumazenil
,
were
able
to
intensify
BDZ
withdrawal
signs
in
mice
.

The
most
apparent
effects
were
observed
after
administration
of
DPCPX
,
indicating
that
the
adenosine
A1
receptor
may
play
a
more
important
role
in
these
effects
.

The
obtained
data
demonstrate
that
the
adenosinergic
system
is
involved
in
BDZ
withdrawal
signs
in
mice
,
and
adenosine
A1
receptor
plays
an
important
role
in
this
process
.

RATIONALE
:
Flupentixol

.

RESULTS
:

CONCLUSIONS
:
We
were
able
to
demonstrate
a
moderate
5
-
HT
(
2A
)
and
D
(
1
)
occupancy
under
clinically
relevant
doses
of
flupentixol
,
albeit
lower
than
expected
from
in
vitro
data
and
clearly
below
saturation
.

Therefore
,
if
flupentixol
'
s
efficacy
on
negative
symptoms
is
based
on
its
interaction
with
5
-
HT
(
2A
)
and
/
or
D
(
1
)
receptors
,
it
should
be
highly
dependent
on
serum
concentration
and
thus
on
dosage
and
metabolism
.

However
,
these
data
suggest
that
mechanisms
other
than
D
(
1
)
or
5
-
HT
(
2A
)
antagonism
may
contribute
to
flupentixol
'
s
efficacy
on
negative
symptoms
.

The
adenosine

(
ABCA1
)
gene
plays
a
key
role
in

.

Some
ABCA1
gene
polymorphisms
have
been
associated
with
high

density
lipoprotein

cholesterol
(
HDL

concentrations
.

The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
assess
the
effect
of
three
polymorphisms
,
C69T
,
G378C
,
and
G1051A
(
R219K
)
,

(
Data
from
an
Epidemiological
Study
on
the
Insulin
Resistance
syndrome
)
cohort
study
.

The
T
allele
of
the
C69T
single
nucleotide
polymorphism
(
SNP
)
was
associated
with
higher
HDL
-
C
levels
in
normal
-
weight
men
(
BMI
<
25
kg
/
m
(
2
)
)
.

The
C
allele
of
the
G378C
SNP
was
associated
with
lower
HDL
-
C
in
overweight
subjects
(
BMI
>
or
=
25
kg
/
m
(
2
)
)
.

For
the
G1051A
SNP
,
in
the
normal
-
weight
group
,
the
minor
A
allele
was
significantly
associated
with
higher
HDL
-
C
levels
.

In
contrast
,
in
overweight
people
,
the
minor
allele
was
associated
with
lower
HDL
-
C
levels
.

After
accounting
for
multiple
testing
,
empiric
p
values
remained
significant
for
the
associations
between
G378C
SNP
and
HDL

C
in
the
overweight
group
and
between
G1051A
SNP
and
HDL
-
C
in
the
normal

group
.

This
study
suggests
that
ABCA1
gene
polymorphisms
modulate
HDL
-
C
concentrations
,
in
interaction
with
BMI
,
and
,
thus
,
they
might
influence
cardiovascular
risk
in
the
general

Ankyrin
repeat
and
suppressors
of
cytokine
signaling
box
protein
asb
-
9
targets
creatine
kinase
B
for
degradation
.

The
suppressors
of
cytokine
signaling
(
SOCS
)
proteins
inhibit
cytokine
action
by
direct
interaction
with
Janus
kinases
or
activated
cytokine
receptors
.

In
addition
to
the
N
-
terminal
and
Src
homology
2
domains
that
mediate
these
interactions
,
SOCS
proteins
contain
a
C
-
terminal
SOCS
box
.

DNA
data
base
searches
have
identified
a
number
of
other
protein
families
that
possess
a
SOCS
box
,
of
which
the
ankyrin
repeat
and
SOCS
box
-
containing
(
Asb
)
proteins
constitute
the
largest
.

Although
it
is
known
that
the
SOCS
proteins
are
involved
in
the
negative
regulation
of
cytokine
signaling
,
the
biological
and
biochemical
functions
of
the
Asbs
are
largely
undefined
.

Using
a
proteomics
approach
,
we
demonstrate
that
creatine
kinase
B
(
CKB
)
interacts
with
Asb
-
9
in
a
specific
,
SOCS
box
-
independent
manner
.

This
interaction
increases
the
polyubiquitylation
of
CKB
and
decreases
total
CKB
levels
within
the
cell
.

The
targeting
of
CKB
for
degradation
by
Asb
-
9
was
primarily
SOCS
box
-
dependent
and
suggests
that
Asb
-
9
acts
as
a
specific
ubiquitin
ligase
regulating
levels
of
this
evolutionarily
conserved
enzyme
.

Effect
of
galantamine
on
acetylcholinesterase
and
butyrylcholinesterase
activities
in
the
presence
of
L
-
carnitine
in
rat
selected
brain
and
peripheral
tissues
.

OBJECTIVES
:
The
alkaloid
galantamine
(
GAL
)
,
which
exhibits
a
combined
anticholinesterase
and
direct
parasympathomimetic
mechanism
of
action
,
is
employed
in
conjunction
with
therapeutic
interventions
in
the
stimulation
of
central
cholinergic
transfer
in
cognitive
diseases
.

We
attempted
to
achieve
pharmacologically
-
induced
enhancement
of
the
parasympathomimetic
activity
of
GAL
in
the
key
areas
of
rat
brain
,
using
an
interactive
combination
of
the
alkaloid
with
the
transmembrane
enhancer
L
-
carnitine
(
CAR
)
.

METHODS
:
We
investigated
activities
of
acetylcholinesterase
(
AChE
)
in
brain
areas
(
frontal
cortex
,
basal
ganglia
,
septum
and
hippocampus
)
and
the
hypophysis
,
and
that
of
butyrylcholinesterase
(
BuChE
)
in
plasma
and
liver
.

RESULTS
:
Following
administration
of
the
highest
of
the
GAL
doses
used
(
2
.
5
;
5
;
10
mg
/
kg
i
.
m
.
)
,
AChE
activity
decreased
mainly
in
the
frontal
cortex
,
hippocampus
and
hypophysis
.

In
the
interaction
of
GAL
and
CAR
,
AChE
inhibition
was
stronger
but
without
any
statistical
significance
.

The
peripheral
inhibition
of
BuChE
was
found
to
be
dose
-
dependent
.

Premedication
by
CAR
led
to
a
slight
change
in
the
values
of
the
activities
monitored
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
CAR
in
terms
of
positive
modulation
of
GAL
targeting
to
the
central
nervous
system
had
no
statistically
significant
effect
.

Warfarin
dose
and
the
pharmacogenomics
of
CYP2C9
and
VKORC1
-
rationale
and
perspectives
.

Warfarin
is
the
most
widely
prescribed
oral
anticoagulant
,
but
there
is
greater
than
10
-
fold
interindividual
variability
in
the
dose
required
to
attain
a
therapeutic
response
.

Information
from
pharmacogenomics
,
the
study
of
the
interaction
of
an
individual
'
s
genotype
and
drug
response
,
can
help
optimize
drug
efficacy
while
minimizing
adverse
drug
reactions
.

Pharmacogenetic
analysis
of
two
genes
,
the
warfarin
metabolic
enzyme
CYP2C9
and
warfarin
target
enzyme
,
vitamin
K
epoxide
reductase
complex
1
VKORC1
,
confirmed
their
influence
on
warfarin
maintenance
dose
.

Possession
of
CYP2C9
*
2
or
CYP2C9
*
3
variant
alleles
,
which
result
in
decreased
enzyme
activity
,
is
associated
with
a
significant
decrease
in
the
mean
warfarin
dose
.

Several
single
nucleotide
polymorphisms
(
SNPs
)
in
VKORC1
are
associated
with
warfarin
dose
across
the
normal
dose
range
.

Haplotypes
based
on
these
SNPs
explain
a
large
fraction
of
the
interindividual
variation
in
warfarin
dose
,
and
VKORC1
has
an
approximately
three
-
fold
greater
effect
than
CYP2C9
.

Algorithms
incorporating
genetic
(
CYP2C9
and
VKORC1
)
,
demographic
,
and
clinical
factors
to
estimate
the
warfarin
dosage
,
could
potentially
minimize
the
risk
of
over
dose
during
warfarin
induction
.

Comparative
gene
expression
profiling
of
in

differentiated
megakaryocytes
and

identifies
novel
activatory

.

To
identify
previously
unknown
platelet
receptors
we
compared
the
transcriptomes
of
in

differentiated
megakaryocytes
(
MKs
)
and
erythroblasts
(
EBs
)
.

RNA
was
obtained
from
purified
,
biologically
paired
MK
and
EB
cultures
and
compared
using
cDNA
microarrays
.

Bioinformatical
analysis
of
MK
-
up
-
regulated
genes
identified
151
transcripts
encoding
transmembrane
domain
-
containing
proteins
.

Although
many
of
these
were
known
platelet
genes
,
a
number
of
previously
unidentified
or
poorly
characterized
transcripts
were
also
detected
.

Many
of
these
transcripts
,
including
G6b
,
G6f
,
LRRC32
,
LAT2
,
and
the
G
protein
-
coupled
receptor
SUCNR1
,
encode
proteins
with
structural
features
or
functions
that
suggest
they
may
be
involved
in
the
modulation
of
platelet
function
.

Immunoblotting
on
platelets
confirmed
the
presence
of
the

,
and
flow
cytometric
analysis
confirmed
the
expression
of
G6b
,
G6f
,
and
LRRC32
on
the
surface
of
platelets
.

Through
comparative
analysis
of
expression
in
platelets
and
other
blood
cells
we
demonstrated
that
G6b
,
G6f
,
and
LRRC32
are
restricted
to
the
platelet
lineage
,
whereas
LAT2
and
SUCNR1
were
also
detected
in
other
blood
cells
.

The
identification
of
the
succinate
receptor
SUCNR1
in
platelets
is
of
particular
interest
,
because
physiologically
relevant
concentrations
of
succinate
were
shown
to
potentiate
the
effect
of
low
doses
of
a
variety
of
platelet
agonists
.

Development
and
validation
of
a
non

radioactive
DNA
polymerase
assay
for
studying
cytomegalovirus
resistance
to
foscarnet
.

Phenotypic
characterisation
of
the
human
cytomegalovirus
(
HCMV
)
pUL54
DNA
polymerase
is
a
useful
tool
for
testing
for
mutations
in
the
UL54
gene
thought
to
render
HCMV
resistant
to
foscarnet
.

In
this
study
,
an
in
-
house
non
-
isotopic
method
for
assessing
polymerase
enzymatic
activity
in
the
presence
and
absence
of
foscarnet
was
developed
and
its
utility
for
HCMV
polymerase
phenotyping
evaluated
.

Polymerase
activity
was
assessed
by
monitoring
the
incorporation
of
digoxigenin
-
labelled
nucleotides
into
the
growing
DNA
chain
and
foscarnet
concentrations
inhibiting
enzymatic
activity
by
50
%
were
determined
.

HCMV
DNA
polymerases
were
synthesised
in
vitro
by
expression
of
UL54
under
the
control
of
the
T7
promoter
.

Mutations
of
interest
were
introduced
into
the
wild
-
type
UL54
gene
by
site
-
directed
mutagenesis
.

Mutated
polymerases
and
polymerases
from
HCMV
reference
strains
were
studied
.

The
activity
of
polymerases
containing
mutations
known
to
confer
resistance
to
foscarnet
(
V715M
,
T700A
and
N495K
)
was
inhibited
by
concentrations
of
foscarnet
eight
to
14
times
higher
than
those
required
to
inhibit
wild
-
type
polymerases
.

Our
in

house
non

radioactive
phenotypic
assay
was
sensitive
and
reproducible
.

It
is
also
easy
to
perform
and
could
provide
a
convenient
method
for
characterising
mutations
conferring
resistance
to
foscarnet
in
HCMV
.

Configuration
of
a
scintillation
proximity
assay
for
the
activity
assessment
of
recombinant
human
adenine
phosphoribosyltransferase
.

Adenine
phosphoribosyltransferase
plays
a
role
in
purine
salvage
by
catalyzing
the
direct
conversion
of
adenine
to
adenosine
monophosphate
.

The
involvement
of
the
purine
salvage
pathway
in
tumor
proliferation
and
angiogenesis
makes
adenine
phosphoribosyltransferase
a
potential
target
for
oncology
drug
discovery
.

We
have
expressed
and
characterized
recombinant
,
N
-
terminally
His
-
tagged
human
adenine
phosphoribosyltransferase
.

Two
assay
formats
were
assessed
for
use
in
a
high
throughput
screen
:
a
spectrophotometric
-
based
enzyme
-
coupled
assay
system
and
a
radiometric
ionic
capture
scintillation
proximity
bead
assay
format
.

Ultimately
,
the
scintillation
proximity
assay
format
was
chosen
because
of
automated
screening
compatibility
limitations
of
the
coupled
assay
.

We
describe
here
the
biochemical
characterization
of
adenine
phosphoribosyltransferase
and
the
development
of
a
robust
,
homogeneous
,
384

suitable
for
high

Antitumor
activity
of
sorafenib
in
FLT3
-
driven
leukemic
cells
.

Activating
internal
tandem
duplication
(
ITD
)
insertions
in
the
juxtamembrane
domain
of
the
FLT3
tyrosine
kinase
are
found
in
about
one
fourth
of
patients
with
acute
myeloid
leukemia
and
have
been
shown
to
be
an
independent
negative
prognostic
factor
for
survival
.

We
show
that
sorafenib
(
BAY
43
-
9006
,
Nexavar
)
potently
inhibits
FLT3
enzymatic
and
signaling
activities
.

In
HEK293
cells
stably
transfected
with
FLT3
-
WT
or
FLT3
-
ITD
,
sorafenib
blocked
basal
and
ligand
dependent
FLT3
-
mediated
tyrosine
autophosphorylation
as
well
as
extracellular
signal
-
regulated
kinase1
/

and
Stat5
phosphorylation
.

In
leukemia
cell
lines
MV4
-
11
and
EOL
-
1
,
sorafenib
treatment
resulted
in
decreased
cell
proliferation
and
inhibition
of
FLT3
signaling
.

The
growth
of
the
FLT3
-
independent
RS4
-
11
cell
line
was
only
weakly
inhibited
by
sorafenib
.

Cell
cycle
arrest
and
induction
of
apoptosis
were
observed
upon
treatment
with
sorafenib
in
MV4
-
11
and
EOL
-
1
cells
.

The
antitumor
efficacy
of
sorafenib
was
evaluated
against
the
MV4
-
11
leukemia
grown
subcutaneously
in
NCr
nu
/
nu
mice
.

Doses
of
3
and
10
mg
/
kg
administered
orally
for
14
days
resulted
in
six
and
nine
out
of
10
animals
with
complete
responses
,
respectively
.

The
demonstration
that
sorafenib
exhibits
potent
target
inhibition
and
efficacy
in
FLT3
-
driven
models
suggests
that
this
compound
may
have
a
therapeutic
benefit
for
patients
with
FLT3

driven
leukemias
.

Pegylated
recombinant
human
arginase
(
rhArg
-
peg5
,
000mw
)
inhibits
the
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
proliferation
of
human
hepatocellular
carcinoma
through
arginine
depletion
.

Hepatocellular
carcinoma
(
HCC
)
is
believed
to
be
auxotrophic
for
arginine
through
the
lack
of
expression
of
argininosuccinate
synthetase
(
ASS
)
.

The
successful
use
of
the
arginine
-
depleting
enzyme
arginine
deiminase
(
ADI
)
to
treat
ASS
-
deficient
tumors
has
opened
up
new
possibilities
for
effective
cancer
therapy
.

Nevertheless
,
many
ASS
-
positive
HCC
cell
lines
are
found
to
be
resistant
to
ADI
treatment
,
although
most
require
arginine
for
proliferation
.

Thus
far
,
an
arginine
-
depleting
enzyme
for
killing
ASS
-
positive
tumors
has
not
been
reported
.

Here
,
we
provide
direct
evidence
that
recombinant
human
arginase
(
rhArg
)
inhibits
ASS
-
positive
HCCs
.

All
the
five
human
HCC
cell
lines
we
used
were
sensitive
to
rhArg
but
ADI
had
virtually
no
effect
on
these
cells
.

They
all
expressed
ASS
,
but
not
ornithine
transcarbamylase
(
OTC
)
,
the
enzyme
that
converts
ornithine
,
the
product
of
degradation
of
arginine
with
rhArg
,
to
citrulline
,
which
is
converted
back
to
arginine
via
ASS
.

Transfection
of
HCC
cells
with
OTC
resulted
in
resistance
to
rhArg
.

Thus
,
OTC
expression
alone
may
be
sufficient
to
induce
rhArg
resistance
in
ASS
-
positive
HCC
cells
.

This
surprising
correlation
between
the
lack
of
OTC
expression
and
sensitivity
of
ASS
-
positive
HCC
cells
shows
that
OTC
-
deficient
HCCs
are
sensitive
to
rhArg
-
mediated
arginine
depletion
.

Therefore
,
pretreatment
tumor
gene
expression
profiling
of
ASS
and
OTC
could
aid
in
predicting
tumor
response
to
arginine
depletion
with
arginine
-
depleting
enzymes
.

We
have
also
shown
that
the
rhArg
native
enzyme
and
the
pegylated
rhArg
(
rhArg
-
peg
(
5
,
000mw
)
)
gave
similar
anticancer
efficacy
in
vitro
.

Furthermore
,
the
growth
of
the
OTC
-
deficient
Hep3B
tumor
cells
(
ASS
-
positive
and
ADI
-
resistant
)
in
mice
was
inhibited
by
treatment
with
rhArg
-
peg
(
5
,
000mw
)
,
which
is
active
alone
and
is
synergistic
in
combination
with
5
-
fluorouracil
.

Thus
,
our
data
suggest
that
rhArg
-
peg
(
5
,
000mw
)
is
a
novel
agent
for
effective
cancer
therapy
.

Pyridoxal

Neonatal
epileptic
encephalopathy
can
be
caused
by
inborn
errors
of
metabolism
.

These
conditions
are
often
unresponsive
to
treatment
with
conventional
antiepileptic
drugs
.

Six
children
with
pyridox
(

)
ine

5
'

phosphate
oxidase
(
PNPO
)
deficiency
presented
with
neonatal
epileptic

.

Two
were
treated
with
pyridoxal
5
'
-
phosphate
(
PLP
)
within
the
first
month
of
life
and
showed
normal
development
or
moderate
psychomotor
retardation
thereafter
.

Four
children
with
late
or
no
treatment
died
or
showed
severe
mental
handicap
.

All
of
the
children
showed
atypical
biochemical
findings
.

Prompt
treatment
with
PLP
in
all
neonates
and
infants
with
epileptic
encephalopathy
should
become
mandatory
,
permitting
normal
development
in
at

some
of
those
affected
with
PNPO
deficiency
.

Metabolism
of
vitamin
A
,
all

trans

retinol
,
leads
to
the
formation
of
11
-
cis

retinaldehyde
,
the
visual
chromophore
,
and
all

trans

retinoic
acid
,
which
is
involved
in
the
regulation
of
gene
expression
through
the
retinoic
acid
receptor
.

Enzymes
and
binding
proteins
involved
in
retinoid
metabolism
are
highly
conserved
across
species
.

We
previously
described
a
novel
mammalian
enzyme
that
saturates
the
13
-
14
double
bond
of
all
-
trans
-
retinol
to
produce
all
-
trans
-
13
,
14
-
dihydroretinol
,
which
then
follows
the
same
metabolic
fate
as
that
of
all
-
trans
-
retinol
.

Specifically
,
all
-
trans

13
,
14
-
dihydroretinol
is
transiently
oxidized
to
all
-
trans
-
13
,
14

dihydroretinoic
acid
before
being
oxidized
further
by
Cyp26
enzymes
.

Here
,
we
report
the
identification
of
two
putative
RetSat
homologues
in
zebrafish
,
one
of
which
,
zebrafish
RetSat
A
(
zRetSat
A
)
,
also
had
retinol
saturase
activity
,
whereas
zebrafish
RetSat
B
(
zRetSat
B
)
was
inactive
under
similar
conditions
.

Unlike
mouse
RetSat
(
mRetSat
)
,
zRetSat
A
had
an
altered
bond
specificity
saturating
either
the
13
-
14
or
7
-
8
double
bonds
of
all
-
trans
-
retinol
to
produce
either
all
-
trans
-
13
,
14
-
dihydroretinol
or
all
-
trans
-
7
,
8
-
dihydroretinol
,
respectively
.

zRetSat
A
also
saturated
the
13
-
14
or
7
-
8
double
bonds
of
all
-
trans
-
3
,
4
-
didehydroretinol
(
vitamin
A2
)
,
a
second
endogenous
form
of
vitamin
A
in
zebrafish
.

The
dual
enzymatic
activity
of
zRetSat
A
displays
a
newly
acquired
specificity
for
the
13
-
14
double
bond
retained
in
higher
vertebrates
and
also
the
evolutionarily
preserved
activity
of
bacterial
phytoene
desaturases
and
plant
carotenoid
isomerases
.

Expression
of
zRetSat
A
was
restricted
to
the
liver
and
intestine
of
hatchlings
and
adult
zebrafish
,
whereas
zRetSat
B
was
expressed
in
the
same
tissues
but
at
earlier
developmental
stages
.

Exogenous
all
-
trans
-
retinol
,
all
-
trans
-
13
,
14
-
dihydroretinol
,
or
all
-
trans
-
7
,
8
-
dihydroretinol
led
to
the
strong
induction
of
the
expression
of
the
retinoic
acid
-
metabolizing
enzyme
,
Cyp26A1
,
arguing
for
an
active
signaling
function
of
dihydroretinoid
metabolites
in
zebrafish
.

These
findings
point
to
a
conserved
function
but
altered
specificity
of
RetSat
in
vertebrates
,
leading
to
the
generation
of
various
dihydroretinoid
compounds
,
some
of
which
could
have
signaling
functions
.

Bimodal
occurrence
of
aspartoacylase
in
myelin
and
cytosol
of
brain
.

The
growing
use
of
N
-
acetylaspartate
as
an
indicator
of
neuronal
viability
has
fostered
interest
in
the
biological
function
(
s
)
of
this
unusual
amino
acid
derivative
.

In
considering
the
various
physiological
roles
that
have
been
proposed
for
this
relatively
abundant
molecule
one
is
obliged
to
take
into
account
its
unusual
metabolic
compartmentalization
,
according
to
which
synthesis
and
storage
occur
in
the
neuron
and
hydrolytic
cleavage
in
the
oligodendrocyte
.

The
latter
reaction
,
catalyzed
by
aspartoacylase
(
ASPA
)
,
produces
acetyl
groups
plus
aspartate
and
has
been
proposed
to
occur
in
both
soluble
and
membranous
subfractions
of
white
matter
.

Our
study
supports
such
bimodal
occurrence
and
we
now
present
immunoblot
,
proteomic
,
and
biochemical
evidence
that
the
membrane
-
bound
form
of
ASPA
is
intrinsic
to
purified
myelin
membranes
.

This
was
supported
by
a
novel
TLC
-
based
method
for
the
assay
of
ASPA
.

That
observation
,
together
with
previous
demonstrations
of
numerous
lipid
-
synthesizing
enzymes
in
myelin
,
suggests
utilization
of
acetyl
groups
liberated
by
myelin
-
localized
ASPA
for
lipid
synthesis
within
the
myelin
sheath
.

Such
synthesis
might
be
selective
and
could
explain
the
deficit
of
myelin
lipids
in
animals
lacking
ASPA
.

Hypoxia
and
lactate
production
in
trophoblast
cells
.

The
etiology
of
preeclampsia
is
unknown
but
is
thought
to
be
related
to
hypoxia
in
the
placenta
.

We
previously
reported
that
the
enzyme
lactate
dehydrogenase
(
LDH
)
has
increased
activity
and
gene
expression
in
placentas
from
preeclamptic
pregnancies

Differential

.

LDH
is
responsible
for
pyruvate
conversion
to
lactate
through
glycolysis
.

In
this
study
,
we
further
investigated
the
role
of
hypoxia
in
primary
trophoblast
cells
and
a
cultured
cell
line
,
JEG3
cells
,
to
obtain
a
better
understanding
of
how
it
affects
the
activities
of
lactate
dehydrogenase
,
lactate
production
and
regulatory
genes
,
as
a
possible
model
for
preeclampsia
.

Primary
trophoblast
cells
and
JEG3
cells
were
cultured
under
1
%
oxygen
.

At
6
,
12
and
24h
,
cells
were
analyzed
for
LDHA
and
LDHB
isozyme
activities
,
mRNA
and
protein
expression
compared
to
standard
culture
conditions
.

Lactate
was
measured
from
cell
medium
.

The
hypoxia
inducible
transcription
factor
(
HIF
-
1alpha
)
protein
expression
was
confirmed
by
western
blot
.

Two
lactate
transporters
(
MCT1
and
MCT4
)
mRNA
and
protein
expression
were
also
studied
under
hypoxia
.

Finally
,
lactate
was
measured
in
plasma
obtained
from
patients
with
severe
preeclampsia
.

Under
hypoxic
conditions
,
LDHA
mRNA
is
increased
in
primary
trophoblast
cells
and
JEG3
cells
.

The
HIF
-
1alpha
protein
expression
is
higher
in
hypoxia
-
treated
JEG3
cells
than
control
.

LDHA
isozyme
activity
and
its
protein
expression
are
increased
most
significantly
at
24h
of
culture
under
hypoxia
.

However
,
LDHB
protein
is
unchanged
while
its
mRNA
is
decreased
.

Lactate
secretion
from
JEG3
cells
under
hypoxia
is
increased
,
as
is
the
lactate
levels
in
the
plasma
from
preeclampsia
patients
.

Of
the
two
lactate
transporters
studied
,
MCT4
mRNA
and
protein
level
are
increased
under
hypoxia
.

Our
findings
support
the
role
of
hypoxia
in
inducing
HIF
-
1alpha
activity
in
trophoblasts
and
increasing
LDH
transcription
as
well
as
its
activity
.

Higher
levels
of
lactate
are
produced
and
secreted
which
may
contribute
to
the
higher
lactate
levels
in
plasma
of
preeclamptic
patients
.

These
mechanisms
may
be
important
in
the
pathophysiology
of
preeclampsia

The

was
not

and
did
not

modify
the
association
between

CONCLUSIONS
:
The
FADS2

may
prevent
the
conversion
of

.

However
,
this
metabolic
effect
is
not
translated
into
an

risk
between

It
is
possible
that
,
at

intakes
of

,
any
potential
defect
in
the
transcription
of

is
masked
by
the

Genetic
linkage
of
Fc
gamma
RIIa
and
Fc
gamma
RIIIa
and
implications
for
their
use
in
predicting
clinical
responses
to
CD20
-
directed
monoclonal
antibody
therapy
.

BACKGROUND
:
Polymorphisms
in
FcgammaRIIa
and
FcgammaRIIIa
receptors
are
associated
with
responses
to
the
CD20
-
directed
immunoglobulin
G1
(
IgG1
)
monoclonal
antibody
rituximab
among
patients
with
indolent
lymphoma
.

At
odds
with
the
aforementioned
clinical
observations
has
been
the
finding
that
IgG1
binding
is
impacted
by
polymorphisms
in
FcgammaRIIIa
but
not
FcgammaRIIa
.

One
possibility
for
this
discrepancy
might
involve
linkage
of
polymorphisms
between
FcgammaRIIa
and
FcgammaRIIIa
.

MATERIALS
AND
METHODS
:
As
such
,
we
performed
allelespecific
polymerase
chain
reaction
and
directed
sequencing
of
the
genomic
DNA
coding
region
of
FcgammaRIIA
and
FcgammaRIIIA
for
52
healthy
individuals
.

RESULTS
:
Two
common
polymorphisms
were
observed
for
FcgammaRIIA
(
at
positions
27
and
131
)
and
FcgammaRIIIA
(
at
positions
48
and
158
)
.

Importantly
,
we
observed
linkage
among
polymorphisms
within
and
between
FcgammaRIIa
and
FcgammaRIIIa
,
including
the
expression
of
histidine
at
FcgammaRIIa
-
131
and
valine
at
FcgammaRIIIa
,
both
of
which
are
associated
with
enhanced
responses
to
rituximab
.

The
results
of
these
studies
demonstrate
that
there
is
wide
linkage
within
and
between
polymorphisms
in
FcgammaRIIa
and
FcgammaRIIIa
and
might
provide
an
explanation
for
why
polymorphisms
at
FcgammaRIIa
are
associated
with
rituximab
responses
despite
a
lack
of
impact
on
IgG1
binding
.

CONCLUSION
:
Knowledge
of
such
linkages
could
facilitate
the
development
of
diagnostic
tests
aimed
at
identifying
patients
who
might
be
more
suitable
for
treatment
with
rituximab
and
possibly
other
therapeutic
antibodies

Identification
of
a
novel
polymorphism
in
the
3
'
UTR
of
the
L
-
arginine
transporter
gene
SLC7A1
:
contribution
to
hypertension
and
endothelial
dysfunction
.

BACKGROUND
:
Endothelial
dysfunction
because
of
reduced
nitric
oxide
bioavailability
is
a
key
feature
of
essential
hypertension
.

We
have
found
that
normotensive
siblings
of
subjects
with
essential
hypertension
have
impaired
endothelial
function
accompanied
by
altered
arginine
metabolism
.

METHODS
AND
RESULTS
:
We
have
identified
a
novel
C
/
T
polymorphism
in
the
3
'
UTR
of
the
principal
arginine
transporter
,
solute
carrier
family
7
(
cationic
amino
acid
transporter
,
y
+
system
)
,
member
1
gene
(
SLC7A1
)
.

The
minor
T
allele
significantly
attenuates
reporter
gene
expression
(
P
<

.

)
and
is
impaired
in
its
capacity
to
form
DNA
-
protein
complexes
(
P
<
0
.
05
)
.

In
278
hypertensive
subjects
the
frequency
of
the
T
allele
was
13
.
3
%
compared
with
7
.
6
%
in
498
normotensive
subjects
(
P
<
0
.
001
)
.

Moreover
,
the
overall
genotype
distribution
observed
in
hypertensives
differed
significantly
from
that
in
normotensives
(
P
<
0
.

)
.

To
complement
these
studies
,
we
generated
an
endothelial
-
specific
transgenic
mouse
overexpressing
L
-
arginine
transporter
SLC7A1
.

The
Slc7A1
transgenic
mice
exhibited
significantly
enhanced
responses
to

.

This
was
accompanied
by
elevated

.

CONCLUSIONS
:
The
present
study
identifies
a
key
,
functionally
active
polymorphism
in
the
3
'
UTR
of
SLC7A1
.

As
such
,
this
polymorphism
may
account
for
the
apparent
link
between
altered
endothelial
function
,
L
-
arginine
,
and
nitric
oxide
metabolism
and
predisposition
to

A
novel
tyrosine
kinase
switch
is
a
mechanism
of
imatinib
resistance
in
gastrointestinal
stromal
tumors
.

KIT
or
alpha
-
platelet
-
derived
growth
factor
receptor
(
alpha
-
PDGFR
)
activating
mutations
are
the
pathogenic
mechanisms
that
characterize
gastrointestinal
stromal
tumors
(
GIST
)
.

Despite
excellent
responses
to
imatinib
mesylate
(
IM
)
,
patients
are
relapsing
.

We
developed
an
IM
-
resistant
GIST
cell
line
(
GIST
-
R
)
from
the
IM
-
sensitive
GIST882
cell
line
(
GIST
-
S
)
by
growing
these
cells
in
IM
.

Gene
expression
profiling
(
GEP
)
of
GIST
-
S
,
GIST
-
R
cells
and
two
IM
resistant
GIST
patients
demonstrated
that
KIT
is
downregulated
implying
a
major
role
in
IM
resistance
.

Instead
,
GIST
-
R
cells
have
acquired
IM
resistance
by
overexpressing
the
oncogenic
receptor
tyrosine
kinase
-
AXL
-
in
a
'
kinase
switch
'
.

Further
,
the
two
IM
resistant
GIST
patients
express
AXL
and
not
c
-
Kit
,
seen
by
immunohistochemistry
(
IHC
)
.

Real
time
reverse
transcriptase
-
polymerase
chain
reaction
and
Western
blotting
of
the
GIST
-
S
and
GIST
-
R
cells
confirmed
the
switch
from
Kit
to
AXL
.

In
GIST
-
R
,
AXL
is
tyrosine
phosphorylated
and
its
ligand
growth
-
arrest
-
specific
gene
6
is
overexpressed
implying
autocrine
activation
.

The
kinase
switch
is
associated
with
a
morphological
change
from
spindle
to
epithelioid
.

Molecular
modeling
of
the
kinase
domain
of
mutant
c
-
Kit
(
V654A
)
and
AXL
showed
no
binding
to
IM
but
efficient
binding
to
MP470
,
a
novel
c
-
Kit
/
AXL
kinase
inhibitor
.

MP470
synergizes
with
docetaxel
(
taxotere
)
and
is
cytotoxic
to
GIST
cells
.

Induction
of
cyp1a1
is
a
nonspecific
biomarker
of
aryl
hydrocarbon
receptor
activation
:
results
of
large
scale
screening
of
pharmaceuticals
and
toxicants
in
vivo
and
in
vitro
.

Expression
of
Cyp1a1
and
its
related
enzyme
activity
have
long
been
used
as
a
biomarker
for
aryl
hydrocarbon
receptor
(
AhR
)
activation
and
a
warning
of
dioxin
-
like
toxicity
.

As
a
result
,
induction
of
Cyp1a1
by
pharmaceutical
drug
candidates
or
environmental
contaminants
raises
significant
concern
in
risk
assessment
.

The
current
study
evaluates
the
specificity
of
Cyp1a1
induction
as
a
marker
for
AhR
affinity
and
activation
and
provides
context
to
assess
the
relevancy
of
AhR
activation
to
risk
assessment
.

In
vivo
experiments
examined
the
expression
of
Cyp1a1
and
other
AhR
-
regulated
genes
in
liver
,
kidney
,
and
heart
in
response
to
596
compounds
.

From
this
data
set
,
a
subset
of
147
compounds
was
then
evaluated
for
their
ability
to
activate
or
bind
to
the
AhR
using
a
combination
of
gel
shift
,
reporter
gene
,
and
competitive
receptor
binding
assays
.

Whereas
in
vivo
Cyp1a1
mRNA
expression
is
a
sensitive
marker
for
AhR
activation
,
it
lacks
specificity
,
because
81
(
59
%
)
of
137
compounds
were
found
to
significantly
induce
Cyp1a1
in
vivo
but
were
not
verified
to
bind
or
activate
the
AhR
in
vitro
.

Combining
in
vivo
and
in
vitro
findings
,
we
identified
nine
AhR
agonists
,
six
of
which
are
marketed
therapeutics
and
have
been
approved
by
the
U
.
S
.

Food
and
Drug
Administration
,
including
leflunomide
,
flutamide
,
and
nimodipine
.

These
drugs
do
not
produce
dioxin
-
like
toxicity
in
rats
or
in
humans
.

These
data
demonstrate
that
induction
of
Cyp1a1
is
a
nonspecific
biomarker
of
direct
AhR
affinity
and
activation
and
lend
further
support
to
the
hypothesis
that
Cyp1a1
induction
and
/
or
AhR
activation
is
not
synonymous
with
dioxin
-
like
toxicity
.

Antipsychotic

(

)
enzyme
.

RATIONALE
:
Recent
studies
provide
evidence
for
reduced
phosphodiesterase
-
4B
(
PDE4B
)
as
a
genetic
susceptibility
factor
as
well
as
suggesting
an
association
of
several
single
nucleotide
polymorphisms
(
SNPs
)
in
PDE4B
that
are
associated
with
an
increased
incidence
of
schizophrenia
.

OBJECTIVES
:
The
aim
of
the
current
study
was
to
assess
the
activity
of
rolipram
,
a
nonsubtype
-
selective
PDE4
inhibitor
,
in
several
animal
models
predictive
of
antipsychotic
-
like
efficacy
and
side
-
effect
liability
and
to
use
PDE4B
wild
-
type
and
knockout
mice
to
begin
to
understand
the
subtypes
involved
in
the
activity
of
rolipram
.

RESULTS
:
In
rats
,
rolipram
antagonized
both
phencyclidine
hydrochloride
-
and
D
-
amphetamine
-
induced
hyperactivity
and
inhibited
conditioned
avoidance
responding
(
CAR
)
.

In
PDE4B
wild
-
type
mice
,
rolipram
dose
-
dependently
suppressed
CAR
(
ED
(
50
)
=
2
.
4
mg
/
kg
)
;
however
,
in
knockout
mice
,
their
sensitivity
to
rolipram
at
the
higher
doses
(
1
.
0
and
3
.
2
mg
/
kg
)
was
reduced
,
resulting
in
a
threefold
shift
in
the
ED
(
50
)
(
7
.
3
mg
/
kg
)
,
suggesting
PDE4B
is
involved
,
at
least
in
part
,
with
the
activity
of
rolipram
.

Only
the
highest
dose
of
rolipram
(
3
.
2
mg
/
kg
)
produced
a
modest
but
significant
degree
of
catalepsy
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
Rolipram
has
a
pharmacologic
profile
similar
to
that
of
the
atypical
antipsychotics
and
has
low
extrapyramidal
symptom
liability
.

These
results
suggest
that
PDE4B
mediates
the
antipsychotic
effects
of
rolipram
in
CAR
and
that
the
PDE4B
-
regulated
cyclic
adenosine
monophosphate
signaling
pathway
may
play
a
role
in
the
pathophysiology
and
pharmacotherapy
of
psychosis

with
significant
improvements
relative
to

in

Improvements

)
were
significantly
greater
with
sitagliptin

than
with

.

As
add

in

,
sitagliptin
improved
HbA

to
a
significantly
greater
extent
than
placebo
when
added
to
metformin
or
pioglitazone
and
was

alone
or
in

,
with
an

The

and
,
in

alpha7

Inbred

display
significant
differences
in
their
levels
of
brain
alpha7

(
alpha7
nAChR
)
expression
,
as
measured
by
binding
of
the

alpha

.

Variations
in

binding
have
been
shown
to
correlate
with
an

.

In

strains
,
C3H

2Ibg
(
C3H
)
and
DBA
/
2Ibg
(
DBA

)
,
the
inter
-
strain
binding
differences
are
linked
to
a
restriction
length
polymorphism
in
the
alpha7
nAChR
gene
,
Chrna7
.

Despite
this
finding
,
the
molecular
mechanism
(
s
)
through
which
genetic
variability
in
Chrna7
may
contribute
to
alpha7
nAChR
expression
differences
remains
unknown
.

However
,
studies
of
the
human
alpha7
nAChR
gene
(
CHRNA7
)
previously
have
demonstrated
that
CHRNA7
promoter
polymorphisms
are
associated
with
differences
in
promoter
activity
as
well
as
differences
in
sensory
processing
.

In
the
present
study
,
a
947
-
base
pair
region
of
the
Chrna7
promoter
was
cloned
from
both
the
C3H
and
DBA
/
2
inbred
mouse
strains
in
an
attempt
to
identify
polymorphisms
that
may
underlie
alpha7
nAChR
differential
expression
.

Sequence
analysis
of
these
fragments
identified
14
single
nucleotide
polymorphisms
(
SNPs
)
.

A
combination
of
two
of
these
SNPs
affects
promoter
activity
in
an
in
vitro
luciferase
reporter
assay
.

These
results
suggest
a
mechanism
through
which
the
Chrna7
promoter
genotype
may
influence
interstrain
variations
in
alpha7
nAChR
expression
.

A
single
residue
in
leucyl
-
tRNA
synthetase
affecting
amino
acid
specificity
and
tRNA
aminoacylation
.

Human
mitochondrial
leucyl
-
tRNA
synthetase
(
hs
mt
LeuRS
)
achieves
high
aminoacylation
fidelity
without
a
functional
editing
active
site
,
representing
a
rare
example
of
a
class
I
aminoacyl
-
tRNA
synthetase
(
aaRS
)
that
does
not
proofread
its
products
.

Previous
studies
demonstrated
that
the
enzyme
achieves
high
selectivity
by
using
a
more
specific
synthetic
active
site
that
is
not
prone
to
errors
under
physiological
conditions
.

Interestingly
,
the
synthetic
active
site
of
hs
mt
LeuRS
displays
a
high
degree
of
homology
with
prokaryotic
,
lower
eukaryotic
,
and
other
mitochondrial
LeuRSs
that
are
less
specific
.

However
,
there
is
one
residue
that
differs
between
hs
mt
and
Escherichia
coli
LeuRSs
located
on
a
flexible
closing
loop
near
the
signature
KMSKS
motif
.

Here
we
describe
studies
indicating
that
this
particular
residue
(
K600
in
hs
mt
LeuRS
and
L570
in
E
.
coli
LeuRS
)
strongly
impacts
aminoacylation
in
two
ways
:
it
affects
both
amino
acid
discrimination
and
transfer
RNA
(
tRNA
)
binding
.

While
this
residue
may
not
be
in
direct
contact
with
the
amino
acid
or
tRNA
substrate
,
substitutions
of
this
position
in
both
enzymes
lead
to
altered
catalytic
efficiency
and
perturbations
to
the
discrimination
of
leucine
and
isoleucine
.

In
addition
,
tRNA
recognition
and
aminoacylation
is
affected
.

These
findings
indicate
that
the
conformation
of
the
synthetic
active
site
,
modulated
by
this
residue
,
may
be
coupled
to
specificity
and
provide
new
insights
into
the
origins
of
selectivity
without
editing
.

Gene
expression
signature
of
parathion
-
transformed
human
breast
epithelial
cells
.

Environmental
substances
seem
to
be
involved
in
the
etiology
of
breast
cancers
.

Many
studies
have
found
an
association
between
human
cancer
and
exposure
to
agricultural
pesticides
such
as
the
organophosphorous
pesticides
.

Parathion
is
a
cholinesterase
inhibitor
that
induces
the
hydrolysis
of
body
choline
esters
,
including
acetylcholine
at
cholinergic
synapses
.

The
primary
target
of
action
in
insects
is
the
nervous
system
whereby
pesticides
inhibit
the
release
of
the
enzyme
acetylcholinesterase
at
the
synaptic
junction
.

Atropine
is
a
parasympatholytic
alkaloid
used
as
an
antidote
to
acetylcholinesterase
inhibitors
.

The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
determine
the
effect
of
parathion
and
atropine
on
cell
transformation
of
human
breast
epithelial
cells
in
vitro
.

These
studies
showed
that
parathion
alone
was
able
to
induce
malignant
transformation
of
an
immortalized
human
breast
epithelial
cell
line
,
MCF
-
10F
as
indicated
by
increased
cell
proliferation
,
anchorage
independency
and
invasive
capabilities
.

There
was
also
an
increase
in

-

,
Ezrin
,
beta
catenin
and
mutant
p53
protein
expression
in
the
parathion
-
treated
cells
.

However
,
atropine
significantly
inhibited
this
increase
.

In
a
human
cell
cycle
array
of
96
genes
,
13
of
them
were
altered
by
parathion
treatment
.

Among
the
genes
affected
were
the
cyclins
,
such
as
cyclin
D3
,
the
cyclin
-
dependent
kinases
(
CDKs
)
such
as
CDK41
and
the
minichromosome
maintenance
deficient
(
MCM
)
MCM2
and
MCM3
.

It
is
suggested
that
parathion
influences
human
breast
epithelial
cell
transformation
and
is
an
initiator
factor
in
the
transformation
process
in
breast
cancer
.

Glutathione
is
a
tripeptide
composed
of
glutamate
,

.

Glutathione
is
present
in
millimolar
concentrations
in
most
mammalian
cells
and
it
is
involved
in
several
fundamental
biological
functions
,
including

,
redox
reactions
,

of

,
as
well
as

.

Glutathione
is
metabolised
via
the
gamma

cycle
,
which
is
catalyzed
by
six
enzymes
.

In
man
,
hereditary
deficiencies
have
been
found
in
five
of
the
six
enzymes
.

Glutathione
synthetase

is
the
most

in

,
it

associated
with
hemolytic

,
and
some
patients
with
this
disorder
show

seems
to
vary
significantly

The
aims

Application
of
the
bradford
hill
criteria
to
assess
the
causality
of
cisapride
-
induced
arrhythmia
:
a
model
for
assessing
causal
association
in
pharmacovigilance
.

INTRODUCTION
:
The
Bradford
Hill
criteria
are
a
widely
used
,
useful
tool
for
the
assessment
of
biomedical
causation
.

We
have
examined
their
application
to
pharmacovigilance
using
the
example
of
cisapride
-
induced
QTc
interval
prolongation
/
arrhythmia
.

METHODS
:
A
literature
search
was
conducted
using
MEDLINE
,
EMBASE
,
Reactions
Weekly
and
regulatory
websites
to
identify
evidence
for
the
association
between
cisapride
and
QTc
interval
prolongation
/
arrhythmia
that
had
been
published
in
the
English
language
.

Two
hundred
and
five
publications
were
identified
as
being
potentially
suitable
for
the
study
.

After
excluding
irrelevant
articles
,
studies
on
high
-
risk
populations
and
review
articles
,
70
publications
were
assessed
using
the
Bradford
Hill
criteria
.

These
included
24
case
reports
,
case
series
or
spontaneous
report
summaries
;
eight
epidemiological
studies
;
22
clinical
studies
;
and
16
experimental
(
in
vivo
and
in
vitro
)
publications
.

RESULTS
:
The
most
compelling
evidence
for
an
association
between
cisapride
use
and
QTc
interval
prolongation
/
arrhythmia
came
from
case
/
spontaneous
reports
and
biological
plausibility
.

Considering
the
rare
incidence
of
serious
cardiac
events
,
these
criteria
formed
the
basis
for
the
strength
of
the
association
.

The
number
of
reports
from
different
populations
showed
consistency
.

Specificity
was
supported
by
clinical
and
cardiographic
characterisation
of
the
events
.

There
were
temporal
relationships
between
the
events
and
the
initiation
of
cisapride
treatment
,
increases
in
the
dosage
and
the
receipt
of
interacting
medications
.

The
relationships
between
the
adverse
events
and
the
latter
two
factors
exhibited
biological
gradients
.

Experimental
evidence
could
be
found
from
biological
models
,
as
well
as
reports
of
positive
dechallenge
and
/
or
rechallenge
found
in
individual
patients
.

Cisapride
was
found
to
bind
the
human
ether
-
a
-
go
-
go
-
related
gene
(
HERG
)
potassium
channel
,
which
provides
a
plausible
mechanism
for
QTc
interval
prolongation
/
arrhythmia
.

Other
QTc
interval
-
prolonging
/
arrhythmic
drugs
that
also
bind
to
HERG
provided
an
analogy
for
cisapride
causing
QTc
interval
prolongation
/
arrhythmia
via
this
mechanism
.

The
evidence
provided
by
clinical
studies
was
inconsistent
,
and
epidemiological
studies
failed
to
demonstrate
an
association
.

Nevertheless
,
this
did
not
prevent
the
assessment
of
causation
.

DISCUSSION
:
This
study
showed
how
different
types
of
evidence
found
in
pharmacovigilance
can
be
evaluated
using
the
Bradford
Hill
criteria
.

Further
work
is
required
to
examine
how
the
criteria
can
be
applied
to
different
types
of
adverse
events
and
how
they
may
be
applied
to
pharmacovigilance
.

,
exerted
a
similar
effect
as
sulindac
.

Sulindac
suppressed
14
-
3
-
3epsilon
promoter
activity
.

As
14
-
3
-
3epsilon
promoter
activation
is
mediated
by
peroxisome
proliferator
-
activated
receptor
delta
(
PPARdelta
)
,
we
determined
the
correlation
between
14
-
3
-
3epsilon
inhibition
and
PPARdelta
suppression
by
NSAIDs
.

Sulindac
sulfide
inhibited
PPARdelta
protein
expression
and
PPARdelta
transcriptional
activity
.

Overexpression
of
PPARdelta
by
adenoviral
transfer
rescued
14
-
3
-
3epsilon
proteins
from
elimination
by
sulindac
or
indomethacin
.

NSAID
-
induced
14
-
3
-
3epsilon
suppression
was
associated
with
reduced
cytosolic
Bad

elevation
of
mitochondrial
Bad
and
increase
in

which
was
rescued

.

Stable
expression
of
14
-
3
-
3epsilon
in
HT
-

significantly
protected
cells
from
apoptosis
.

Our
findings
shed
light
on
a
novel
mechanism
by
which
NSAIDs
induce
colorectal
cancer
apoptosis
via
the
PPARdelta
/
14
-
3
-
3epsilon
transcriptional
pathway
.

These
results
suggest
that
14

3
-
3epsilon
is
a
target
for
the
prevention
and
therapy
of
colorectal
cancer
.

revealed
KCC1
,
KCC3
,
and
KCC4
isoform
expression
,
whereas
KCC2
was
undetectable
.

During
a
hypotonic
challenge
,
KCC1
membrane
content
increased
more
rapidly
in
HCEC
than
in
RCEC
.

Such
a
challenge
induced
a
larger
increase
and
more
transient
p44
/
42MAPK
activation
in
HCEC
than
RCEC
.

On
the
other
hand
,
HCEC
and
RCEC
p38MAPK
phosphorylation
reached
peak
activations
at
2
.
5
and
15
min
,
respectively
.

Only
in
HCEC
,
pharmacological
manipulation
of
KCC
activity
modified
the
hypotonicity
-
induced
activation
of
p44
/
42MAPK
,
whereas
p38MAPK
phosphorylation
was
insensitive
to
such
procedures
in
both
cell
lines
.

Larger
increases
in
HCEC
KCC1
membrane
protein
content
correlated
with
their
ability
to
undergo
faster
and
more
complete
RVD
.

Furthermore
,
pharmacological
activation
of
KCC
increased
p44
/
42MAPK
phosphorylation
in
HCEC
but
not
in
RCEC
,
presumably
a
reflection
of
low
KCC1
membrane
expression
in
RCEC
.

These
findings
suggest
that
KCC1
plays
a
role
in
(
i
)
maintaining
isotonic
steady
-
state
cell
volume
homeostasis
,
(
ii
)
recovery
of

after

through

,
and
(

regulating

activation
of
the

Preclinical
pharmacokinetics
and
in
vitro
metabolism
of
dasatinib
(
BMS

)
:
a

inhibitor
against

.

PURPOSE
:
Dasatinib
(
BMS
-
354825
)
,
a
potent
oral
multi
-
targeted
kinase
inhibitor
against
SRC
and
BCR
-
ABL
,
has
recently
been
approved
for
the
treatment
of
chronic
myelogenous
leukaemia
(
CML
)
in
imatinib
-
acquired
resistance
and
intolerance
.

In
vitro
and
in
vivo
studies
were
conducted
to
characterize
the
pharmacokinetics
and
metabolism
of
dasatinib
in
mouse
,
rat
,
dog
,
and
monkey
.

Possible
mechanisms
contributing
to
the
incomplete
oral
bioavailability
of
dasatinib
in
animals
were
investigated
.

METHODS
:
Metabolic
stability
of
dasatinib
was
measured
after
incubation
with
liver
microsomes
(
either
NADPH
-
or
UDPGA
-
fortified
)
and
isolated
hepatocytes
obtained
from
mouse
,
rat
,
dog
,
monkey
,
and
human
.

In
all
cases
,
substrate
depletion
over
time
was
measured
,
and
appropriate
scaling
factors
were
used
to
predict
in
vivo
clearance
.

Pharmacokinetics
of
dasatinib
were
determined
in
mice
,
rats
,
dogs
,
and
monkeys
after
administration
of
single
intravenous
or
oral
doses
.

In
addition
,
the
routes
of
excretion
were
investigated
after
administration
of
dasatinib
to
bile
duct
cannulated
(
BDC
)
rats
.

Absorption
and
first
-
pass
metabolism
were
evaluated
as
possible
reasons
for
the
incomplete
oral
bioavailability
using
various
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
models
like
Caco
-
2
cells
,
P
-
glycoprotein
(
P
-
gp
)
knockout
mice
,
and
intra
-
portal
dosing
in
rats
.

RESULTS
:
In
vivo
systemic
plasma
clearance
values
of
dasatinib
were
62
,
26
,
25
,
and
34
ml
/
min
/
kg
in
mouse
,
rat
,
dog
,
and
monkey
,
respectively
.

Scaling
of
in
vitro
hepatocyte
and
liver
microsomal
data
gave
reasonably
good
predictions
of
in
vivo
clearances
across
all
species
.

Percent
distribution
in
blood
cells
ranged
from
43
%
in
mouse
to
57
%
in
dog
.

Dasatinib
showed
high
volumes
of
distribution
(
>
3
l
/
kg
)
and
high
serum
protein
binding
values
(
>
90
%
)
in
all
four
species
tested
.

Oral
bioavailability
of
dasatinib
ranged
from
14
%
in
the
mouse
to
34
%
in
the
dog
.

In
rats
,
bioavailability
after
an
intraportal
dose
was
comparable
to
that
after
intra
-
arterial
administration
.

In
BDC
rats
,
less
than
15
%
of
an
intravenous
dose
was
excreted
unchanged
in
urine
,
bile
,
and
the
gastrointestinal
tract
,
suggesting
that
dasatinib
is
cleared
primarily
via
metabolism
.

Dasatinib
has
high
intrinsic
permeability
in
Caco
-
2
cells
,
however
,
the
efflux
ratio
was
approximately
two
-
fold
indicating
that
it
may
be
a
substrate
for
an
intestinal
efflux
transporter
.

However
,
in
vivo
studies
in
P
-
gp
knockout
mice
versus
wild
-
type
mice
showed
no
difference
in
the
amount
of
dasatinib
remaining
unabsorbed
in
the
gastrointestinal
tract
,
suggesting
that
P
-
gp
may
not
be
responsible
for
the
incomplete
bioavailability
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
Dasatinib
shows
intermediate
clearance
in
mouse
,
rat
,
dog
,
and
monkey
,
and
distributes
extensively
in
those
species
.

Oxidative
metabolism
appears
to
be
the
predominant
clearance
pathway
.

The
incomplete
oral
bioavailability
may
be
due
to
both
incomplete
absorption
and
high
first
-
pass
metabolism
.

However
,
the
efflux
transporter
,
P
-
glycoprotein
does
not
appear
to
be
limiting
oral
absorption
.

Molecular
determinants
for
the
selective
inhibition
of
cyclooxygenase
-
2
by
lumiracoxib
.

Lumiracoxib
is
the
first
example
of
a
marketed
COX
-
2
inhibitor
of
the
arylacetic
acid
class
,
and
it
is
reported
to
be
the
most
selective
COXIB
in
vivo
.

However
,
the
molecular
basis
of
its
COX
-
2
inhibition
has
not
been
completely
defined
.

Using
standard
assays
,
lumiracoxib
was
found
to
be
a
poor
inhibitor
of
purified
ovine
COX
-
1
and
a
relatively
weak
inhibitor
of
purified
human
COX
-
2
.

The
extent
of
COX
-
2
inhibition
plateaued
at
around
50
%
and
suggested
that
the
inhibitor
may
be
reversibly
bound
to
the
enzyme
.

Kinetic
studies
with
lumiracoxib
demonstrated
that
it
was
a
time
-
dependent
and
slowly
reversible
inhibitor
of
human
COX
-
2
that
exhibited
at
least
two
binding
steps
during
inhibition
.

Derivatives
of
lumiracoxib
were
synthesized
with
or
without
the
methyl
group
on
the
phenylacetic
acid
ring
and
with
various
substitutions
on
the
lower
aniline
ring
.

Inhibition
studies
demonstrated
that
the
methyl
group
on
the
phenylacetic
acid
ring
is
required
for
COX
-
2
selectivity
.

The
chemical
identity
and
position
of
the
substituents
on
the
lower
aniline
ring
were
important
in
determining
the
potency
and
extent
of
COX
inhibition
as
well
as
COX
-
2
selectivity
.

Mutation
of
Ser
-
530
to
Ala
or
Val
-
349
to
Ala
or
Leu
abolished
the
potent
inhibition
observed
with
wild
-
type
human
COX
-
2
and
key
lumiracoxib
analogs
.

Interestingly
,
a
Val
-
349
to
Ile
mutant
was
inhibited
with
equal
potency
to
human
COX
-
2
with
2
,
6
-
dichloro
-
,
2
,
6
-
dimethyl
-
,
or
2
-
chloro
-
6
-
methyl
-
substituted
inhibitors
and
,
in
the
case
of
lumiracoxib
,
actually
showed
an
increase
in
potency
.

Taken
together
with
a
recent
crystal
structure
of
a
lumiracoxib
-
COX
-
2
complex
,
the
kinetic
analyses
presented
herein
of
the
inhibition
of
mutant
COX
-
2s
by
lumiracoxib
allows
the
definition
of
the
molecular
basis
of
COX
-
2
inhibition
.

Underexpression
of
the
Na
+
-
dependent
neutral
amino
acid
transporter
ASCT2
in
the
spontaneously
hypertensive
rat
kidney
.

This
study
examined
the
inward
transport
of
l
-
[
(
14
)
C
]
alanine
,
an
ASCT2
preferential
substrate
,
in
monolayers
of
immortalized
renal
proximal
tubular
epithelial
(
PTE
)
cells
from
Wistar
-
Kyoto
(
WKY
)
and
spontaneously
hypertensive
(
SHR
)
rats
.

The
expression
of
ASCT2
in
WKY
and
SHR
PTE
cells
and
kidney
cortices
from
WKY
and
SHR
was
also
evaluated
.

l
-
[
(
14
)
C
]
alanine
uptake
was
highly
dependent
on
extracellular
Na
(
+
)
.

Replacement
of
NaCl
by
LiCl
or
choline
chloride
abolished
transport
activity
in
SHR
and
WKY
PTE
cells
.

In
the
presence
of
the
system
L
inhibitor
BCH
,
Na
(
+
)
-
dependent
l
-
alanine
uptake
in
WKY
and
SHR
PTE
cells
was
inhibited
by
alanine
,
serine
,
and
cysteine
,
which
is
consistent
with
amino
acid
transport
through
ASCT2
.

The
saturable
component
of
Na
(
+
)
-
dependent
l
-
alanine
transport
under
V
(
max
)
conditions
in
SHR
PTE
cells
was
one
-
half
of
that
in
WKY
PTE
cells
,
with
similar
K
(
m
)
values
.

Differences
in
magnitude
of
Na
(
+
)
-
dependent
l
-
alanine
uptake
through
ASCT2
between
WKY
and
SHR
PTE
cells
correlated
positively
with
differences
in
ASCT2
protein
expression
,
this
being
more
abundant
in
WKY
PTE
cells
.

Abundance
of
ASCT2
transcript
and
protein
in
kidney
cortices
of
SHR
rats
was
also
lower
than
that
in
normotensive
WKY
rats
.

In
conclusion
,
immortalized
SHR
and
WKY
PTE
cells
take
up
l
-
alanine
mainly
through
a
high
-
affinity
Na
(
+
)
-
dependent
amino
acid
transporter
,
with
functional
features
of
ASCT2
transport
.

The
activity
and
expression
of
the
ASCT2
transporter
were
considerably
lower
in
the
SHR
cells
.

Glucagon
receptor
antagonism
improves
islet
function
in
mice
with
insulin
resistance
induced
by
a
high
-
fat
diet
.

AIMS
/
HYPOTHESIS
:
Increased
glucagon
secretion
predicts
deterioration
of
glucose
tolerance
,
and
high
glucagon
levels
contribute
to
hyperglycaemia
in
type
2
diabetes
.

Inhibition
of
glucagon
action
may
therefore
be
a
potential
novel
target
to
reduce
hyperglycaemia
.

Here
,
we
investigated
whether
chronic
treatment
with
a
glucagon
receptor
antagonist
(
GRA
)
improves
islet
dysfunction
in
female
mice
on
a
high

diet
(
HFD
)
.

MATERIALS
AND
METHODS
:
After
8
weeks
of
HFD
,
mice
were
treated
with
a
small
molecule
GRA
(
300
mg

kg
,
gavage
once
daily
)
for
up
to
30
days
.

Insulin
secretion
was
studied
after
oral
and
intravenous
administration
of
glucose
and
glucagon
secretion
after
intravenous
arginine
.

Islet
morphology
was
examined
and
insulin
secretion
and
glucose
oxidation
were
measured
in
isolated
islets
.

Fasting

Hydrogen
sulfide
acts
as
a
mediator
of
inflammation
in
acute
pancreatitis
:
in
vitro
studies
using
isolated
mouse
pancreatic
acinar
cells
.

Hydrogen
sulphide
(
H
(
2
)
S
)
is
synthesized
from
L
-
cysteine
via
the
action
of
cystathionine
-
gamma
-
lyase
(
CSE
)
and
cystathionine
-
beta
-
synthase
(
CBS
)
.

We
have
earlier
shown
that
H
(
2
)
S
acts
as
a
mediator
of
inflammation
.

However
the
mechanism
remains
unclear
.

In
this
study
,
we
investigated
the
presence
of
H
(
2
)
S
and
the
expression
of
H
(
2
)
S
synthesizing
enzymes
,
CSE
and
CBS
,
in
isolated
mouse
pancreatic
acini
.

Pancreatic
acinar
cells
from
mice
were
incubated
with
or
without
caerulein
(
10
(
-
7
)
M
for
30
and
60
min
)
.

Caerulein
increased
the
levels
of
H
(
2
)
S
and
CSE
mRNA
expression
while
CBS
mRNA
expression
was
decreased
.

In
addition
,
cells
pre
-
treated
with
DL
-
propargylglycine
(
PAG
,
3
mM
)
,
a
CSE
inhibitor
,
reduced
the
formation
of
H
(
2
)
S
in
caerulein
treated
cells
,
suggesting
that
CSE
may
be
the
main
enzyme
involved
in
H
(
2
)
S
formation
in
mouse
acinar
cells
.

Furthermore
,
substance
P
(
SP
)
concentration
in
the
acini
and
expression
of
SP
gene
(
preprotachykinin
-
A
,
PPT
-
A
)
and
neurokinin
-
1
receptor
(
NK
-
1R
)
,
the
primary
receptor
for
SP
,
are
increased
in
secretagogue
caerulein
-
treated
acinar
cells
.

Inhibition
of
endogenous
production
of
H
(
2
)
S
by
PAG
significantly
suppressed
SP
concentration
,
PPT
-
A
expression
and
NK1
-
R
expression
in
the
acini
.

To
determine
whether
H
(
2
)
S
itself
provoked
inflammation
in
acinar
cells
,
the
cells
were
treated
with
H
(
2
)
S
donor
drug
,
sodium
hydrosulphide
(
NaHS
)
,
(
10
,
50
and
100
muM
)
,
that
resulted
in
a
significant
increase
in
SP
concentration
and
expression
of
PPT
-
A
and
NK1
-
R
in
acinar
cells
.

These
results
suggest
that
the
pro
-
inflammatory
effect
of
H
(
2
)
S
may
be
mediated
by
SP
-
NK
-
1R
related
pathway
in
mouse
pancreatic
acinar
cells
.

Dexamethasone
(

)
decreased
the
expression
of

,
VEGF
,
and
iNOS
induced
by
reIL

,
while
1400W

,
a

,
decreased
the

These
findings
suggest
that

may
contribute
to
pulmonary
neutrophilia
during
allergic

by
the
increased
expression
of

by

cells
.

DXM
and
the

may
decrease
pulmonary

due
,
in

,
to
a
direct
inhibition
of
some
of

[
Short
QT
syndrome
]
.

Short
QT
syndrome
is
a
new
genetic
disorder
associated
with
familial
atrial
fibrillation
and
/
or
sudden
death
or
syncope
.

To
date
,
different
mutations
in
genes
encoding
for
cardiac
ion
channels
(
KCNH2
,
KCNQ1
,
and
KCNJ2
)
have
been
identified
to
cause
the
short
QT
syndrome
.

The
mutations
lead
to
a
gain
of
function
of
the
affected
current
(
IKr
,
IKs
,
and
IK1
)
.

The
phenotype
is
characterized
by
a
shortened
QT
interval
<
335
ms
after
correction
for
heart
rate
at
rates
<
80
beats
/
min
.

Furthermore
,
the
QT
interval
poorly
adapts
to
heart
rate
.

Patients
exhibit
shortened
atrial
and
ventricular
effective
refractory
periods
and
,
in
the
majority
,
inducibility
of
ventricular
fibrillation
.

Death
occurs
already
in
newborns
.

Therapy
of
choice
seems
to
be
the
implantable
cardioverter
defibrillator
because
of
the
high
incidence
of
sudden
death
.

Pharmacological
treatment
has
been
studied
and
it
could
be
demonstrated
,
that
some
mutant
currents
may
be
insufficiently
suppressed
by
drugs
targeted
to
block
the
specific
current
such
as
,
e
.
g
.
,
sotalol
or
ibutilide
in
patients
with
a
mutation
in
the
IKr
-
coding
gene
KCNH2
(
HERG
)
.

Quinidine
proved
to
be
efficient
in
prolonging
the
QT
interval
and
normalizing
the
effective
refractory
periods
in
some
patients
.

Serine
racemases
from
barley
,
Hordeum
vulgare
L
.
,
and
other
plant
species
represent
a
distinct
eukaryotic
group
:
gene
cloning
and
recombinant
protein
characterization
.

Several
d
-
amino
acids
have
been
identified
in
plants
.

However
,
the
biosynthetic
pathway
to
them
is
unclear
.

In
this
study
,
we
cloned
and
sequenced
a
cDNA
encoding
a
serine
racemase
from
barley
which
contained
an
open
reading
frame
encoding
337
amino
acid
residues
.

The
deduced
amino
acid
sequence
showed
significant
identity
to
plant
and
mammalian
serine
racemases
and
contained
conserved
pyridoxal
5
-
phosphate
(
PLP
)
-
binding
lysine
and
PLP
-
interacting
amino
acid
residues
.

The
purified
gene
product
catalyzed
not
only
racemization
of
serine
but
also
dehydration
of
serine
to
pyruvate
.

The
enzyme
requires
PLP
and
divalent
cations
such
as
Ca
(
2
+
)
,
Mg
(
2
+
)
,
or
Mn
(
2
+
)
,
but
not
ATP
,
whereas
mammalian
serine
racemase
activity
is
increased
by
ATP
.

In
addition
to
the
results
regarding
the
effect
of
ATP
on
enzyme
activity
and
the
phylogenetic
analysis
of
eukaryotic
serine
racemases
,
the
antiserum
against
Arabidopsis
serine
racemase
did
not
form
a
precipitate
with
barley
and
rice
serine
racemases
.

This
suggests
that
plant
serine
racemases
represent
a
distinct
group
in
the
eukaryotic
serine
racemase
family
and
can
be
clustered
into
monocot
and
dicot
types
.

Estimation
of
warfarin
maintenance
dose
based
on
VKORC1
(
-
1639

>
A
)
and
CYP2C9
genotypes
.

BACKGROUND
:
CYP2C9
polymorphisms
are
associated
with
decreased
S
-
warfarin
clearance
and
lower
maintenance
dosage
.

Decreased
expression
of
VKORC1
resulting
from
the

A
substitution
has
also
been
implicated
in
lower
warfarin
dose
requirements
.

We
investigated
the
additional
contribution
of
this
polymorphism
to
the
variance
in
warfarin
dose
.

METHODS
:
Sixty

five
patients
with
stable
anticoagulation
were
genotyped
for
CYP2C9
and
VKORC1
with
Tag

.

Plasma
S

warfarin
concentrations
and
warfarin

were
compared
among
patients
on
the
basis
of
the
VKORC1

,
respectively
.

Steady

plasma
concentrations
of

were
lowest
in
patients

.

A
model
including

,
age
,

,
and
body

accounted
for
61
%
of
the
variance
in
warfarin

.

CONCLUSIONS
:
The
VKORC1
-
1639A
allele
accounts
for
low
dosage
requirements
of
most
patients
without
a
CYP2C9
variant
.

Higher
plasma
S
-
warfarin
concentrations
corresponding
to
increased
warfarin
maintenance
dosages
support
a
hypothesis
for
increased
expression
of
the
VKORC1
-
1639G
allele
.

VKORC1
and
CYP2C9
genotypes
,
age
,

,
and

account
for
the
majority
of
variance
in

Cytosolic
aspartate
aminotransferase
,
a
new
partner
in
adipocyte
glyceroneogenesis
and
an
atypical
target
of
thiazolidinedione
.

We
show
that
cytosolic
aspartate
aminotransferase
(
cAspAT
)
is
involved
in
adipocyte
glyceroneogenesis
,
a
regulated
pathway
that
controls
fatty
acid
homeostasis
by
promoting
glycerol
3
-
phosphate
formation
for
fatty
acid
re
-
esterification
during
fasting
.

cAspAT
activity
,
as
well
as
the
incorporation
of
[
(
14
)
C
]
aspartate
into
the
neutral
lipid
fraction
of
3T3
-
F442A
adipocytes
was
stimulated
by
the
thiazolidinedione
(
TZD
)
rosiglitazone
.

Conversely
,
the
ratio
of
fatty
acid
to
glycerol
released
into
the
medium
decreased
.

Regulation
of
cAspAT
gene
expression
was
specific
to
differentiated
adipocytes
and
did
not
require
any
peroxisome
proliferator
-
activated
receptor
gamma
(
PPARgamma
)
/
retinoid
X
receptor
-
alpha
direct
binding
.

Nevertheless
,
PPARgamma
is
indirectly
necessary
for
both
cAspAT
basal
expression
and
TZD
responsiveness
because
they
are
,
respectively
,
diminished
and
abolished
by
ectopic
overexpression
of
a
dominant
negative
PPARgamma
.

The
cAspAT
TZD
-
responsive
site
was
restricted
to
a
single
AGGACA
hexanucleotide
located
at
-
381
to
-
376
bp
whose
mutation
impaired
the
specific
RORalpha
binding
.

RORalpha
ectopic
expression
activated
the
cAspAT
gene
transcription
in
absence
of
rosiglitazone
,
and
its
protein
amount
in
nuclear
extracts
is
1
.
8
-
fold
increased
by
rosiglitazone
treatment
of
adipocytes
.

Finally
,
the
amounts
of
RORalpha
and
cAspAT
mRNAs
were
similarly
increased
by
TZD
treatment
of
human
adipose
tissue
explants
,
confirming
coordinated
regulation
.

Our
data
identify
cAspAT
as
a
new
member
of
glyceroneogenesis
,
transcriptionally
regulated
by
TZD
via
the
control
of
RORalpha
expression
by
PPARgamma
in
adipocytes
.

Platelet

were
measured
by

upon

.

Fibrinogen

were
also
detected

Platelet

prevented

)
the
expression
of
P
-
selectin
and
the
formation
of
mixed

,
while
the
two
reference
heparin
preparations
had
a
much
weaker
effect
.

Platelet
fibrinogen
binding
and
PMN
activation
markers
(
fibrinogen
binding
,
CD11b
and
CD40
)
were
also
prevented
by
parnaparin
.

These
data
extend
in
more
physiological
systems
of
platelet
activation
,
the
anti
-
inflammatory
profile
of
parnaparin
,
previously
reported
in
washed
cells
.

The
greater
effect
of
parnaparin
,
as
compared
to
the
reference
heparins
,
could
be
due
to
chemico

Transfection
of
HepG2
cells
with
hGSTA4
provides
protection
against
4
-
hydroxynonenal
-
mediated
oxidative
injury
.

4
-
Hydroxynonenal
(
4
-
HNE
)
is
a
mutagenic
alpha
,
beta
-
unsaturated
aldehyde
produced
during
oxidative
injury
that
is
conjugated
by
several
glutathione
S
-
transferase
(
GST
)
isoforms
.

The
alpha
class
human
GSTA4
-
4
enzyme
(
hGSTA4
-
4
)
has
a
particularly
high
catalytic
efficiency
toward
4
-
HNE
conjugation
.

However
,
hGST4
-
4
expression
is
low
in
most
human
cells
and
there
are
other
aldehyde
metabolizing
enzymes
that
detoxify
4
-
HNE
.

In
the
current
study
,
we
determined
the
effect
of
over
-
expression
of
hGSTA4
mRNA
on
the
sensitivity
of
HepG2
cells
to
4
-
HNE
injury
.

HepG2
cells
transfected
with
an
hGSTA4
vector
construct
exhibited
high
steady
-
state
hGSTA4
mRNA
,
high
GST
-
4

HNE
catalytic
activities
,
but
lower
basal
glutathione
(
GSH
)
concentrations
relative
to
insert
-
free
vector
(
control
)
cells
.

Exposure
to
4
-
HNE
elicited
an
increase
in
GSH
concentrations
in
the
control
and
hGSTA4
cells
,
although
the
dose
-
response
of
GSH
induction
differed
among
the
two
cell
types
.

Specifically
,
hGSTA4
cells
had
significantly
higher
GSH
concentrations
when
exposed
to
5
-
15
microM
4
-
HNE
,
but
not
at
20
microM
4
-
HNE
,
suggesting
extensive
GSH
utilization
at
high
concentrations
of
4
-
HNE
.

The
hGSTA4
cells
exhibited
a
significant
growth
advantage
relative
to
control
cells
in
the
absence
of
4
-
HNE
,
and
a
trend
towards
increased
growth
at
low
dose
exposures
to
4
-
HNE
.

However
,
the
hGSTA4
cells
did
not
exhibit
a
growth
advantage
relative
to
control
cells
at
higher
4
-
HNE
exposures
associated
with
increased
GSH
utilization
.

As
expected
,
the
hGSTA4
cells
showed
resistance
to
4
-
HNE
stimulated
lipid
peroxidation
at
all
4
-
HNE
doses
.

In
summary
,
our
data
indicates
that
over
-
expression
of
hGSTA4
at
levels
conferring
high
GST
-
4
-
HNE
conjugating
activity
confers
a
partial
growth
advantage
to
HepG2
cells
and
protects
against
4
-
HNE
oxidative
injury
.

However
,
the
loss
of
proliferative
capacity
of
hGSTA4
cells
challenged
with
levels
of
4
-
HNE
associated
with
severe
oxidative
stress
indicates
a
role
of
other
aldehyde
metabolizing
enzymes
,
and

proteins
,
in
providing
full

EphB1
null
mice
exhibit
neuronal
loss
in
substantia
nigra
pars
reticulata
and
spontaneous
locomotor
hyperactivity
.

The
molecular
mechanisms
that
regulate
basal
ganglia
development
are
largely
unknown
.

Eph
receptor
tyrosine
kinases
are
potential
participants
in
this
process
as
they
regulate
development
of
other
CNS
regions
and
are
expressed
in
basal
ganglia
nuclei
,
such
as
the
substantia
nigra
(
SN
)
and
striatum
.

To
address
the
role
of
Eph
receptors
in
the
development
of
these
nuclei
,
we
analysed
anatomical
changes
in
the
SN
and
striatum
of
mice
with
null
mutations
for
EphB1
.

These
mice
express
beta
-
galactosidase
as
a
marker
for
cells
normally
expressing
EphB1
.

In
situ
hybridization
data
and
a
direct
comparison
of
SN
neurons
expressing
tyrosine
hydroxylase
(
TH
)
and
/
or
the
beta
-
gal
marker
for
EphB1
revealed
that
EphB1
is
not
expressed
in
TH
+
neurons
of
pars
compacta
(
SNc
)
,
but
is
restricted
to
neurons
in
pars
reticulata
(
SNr
)
.

Consistent
with
this
,
we
find
that
EphB1
null
mice
exhibit
a
significant
decrease
in
the
volume
and
number
of
neurons
(
40
%
decrease
)
in
SNr
,
whereas
the
volume
and
number
of
TH
+
neurons
in
SNc
is
not
significantly
affected
nor
are
there
changes
in
the
distribution
of
nigrostriatal
dopamine
neurons
.

Although
EphB1
is
expressed
in
the
striatum
,
EphB1
-
/
-
mice
exhibit
no
significant
changes
in
striatal
volume
and
TH
fiber
density
,
and
have
no
obvious
alterations
in
striatal
patch
/
matrix
organization
.

Behavioral
evaluation
of
EphB1
null
mice
in
an
open
-
field
environment
revealed
that
these
mice
exhibited
spontaneous
locomotor
hyperactivity
.

These
results
suggest
that
EphB1
is
necessary
for
the
proper
formation
of
SNr
,
and
that
neuronal
loss
in
SNr
is
associated
with
altered
locomotor
functions
.

Artificial
sweeteners
and
salts
producing
a
metallic
taste
sensation
activate
TRPV1
receptors
.

Throughout
the
world
many
people
use
artificial
sweeteners
(
AS
)
for
the
purpose
of
reducing
caloric
intake
.

The
most
prominently
used
of
these
molecules
include
saccharin
,
aspartame
(
Nutrasweet
)
,
acesulfame
-
K
,
and
cyclamate
.

Despite
the
caloric
advantage
they
provide
,
one
key
concern
in
their
use
is
their
aversive
aftertaste
that
has
been
characterized
on
a
sensory
level
as
bitter
and
/
or
metallic
.

Recently
,
it
has
been
shown
that
the
activation
of
particular
T2R
bitter
taste
receptors
is
partially
involved
with
the
bitter
aftertaste
sensation
of
saccharin
and
acesulfame
-
K
.

To
more
fully
understand
the
biology
behind
these
phenomena
we
have
addressed
the
question
of
whether
AS
could
stimulate
transient
receptor
potential
vanilloid
-
1
(
TRPV1
)
receptors
,
as
these
receptors
are
activated
by
a
large
range
of
structurally
different
chemicals
.

Moreover
,
TRPV1
receptors
and
/
or
their
variants
are
found
in
taste
receptor
cells
and
in
nerve
terminals
throughout
the
oral
cavity
.

Hence
,
TRPV1
activation
could
be
involved
in
the
AS
aftertaste
or
even
contribute
to
the
poorly
understood
metallic
taste
sensation
.

Using
Ca
(
2
+
)
imaging
on
TRPV1
receptors
heterologously
expressed
in
the
human
embryonic
kidney
(
HEK
)
293
cells
and
on
dissociated
primary
sensory
neurons
,
we
find
that
in
both
systems
,
AS
activate
TRPV1
receptors
,
and
,
moreover
,
they
sensitize
these
channels
to
acid
and
heat
.

We
also
found
that
TRPV1
receptors
are
activated
by
CuSO
(
4
)
,
ZnSO
(
4
)
,
and
FeSO
(
4
)
,
three
salts
known
to
produce
a
metallic
taste
sensation
.

In
summary
,
our
results
identify
a
novel
group
of
compounds
that
activate
TRPV1
and
,
consequently
,
provide
a
molecular
mechanism
that
may
account
for

Anthocyanin

stored
at

temperature
.

A
pretreatment
with
20kPa
CO2
+
20
kPa
O2
+
60
kPa
N2
for
3
days
proved
effective
in
maintaining
the
fruit
quality
and
controlling
decay
in
table
grapes
(
Vitis
vinifera
cv
.
Cardinal
)
stored
at
0
degrees
C
.

In
the
present
work
,
we
analyzed
whether
total
anthocyanin
content
,
the
molecular
mechanism
implicated
in
their
biosynthesis
and
antioxidant
activity
is
related
to
the
beneficial
effect
of
this
gaseous
treatment
.

We
isolated
partial
cDNAs
that
codified
for
enzymes
implicated
in
the
anthocyanin
biosynthesis
such
as
l
-
phenylalanine
ammonia
-
lyase
(
PAL
)
and
chalcone
synthase
(
CHS
)
,
and
an
antioxidant
enzyme
such
as
ascorbate
peroxidase
(
APX
)
.

Low
temperatures
induced
an
accumulation
of
total
anthocyanin
content
in
the
skin
of
both
treated
and
non
-
treated
grapes
,
although
levels
were
lower
in
CO2
-
treated
fruit
.

By
contrast
,
antioxidant
activity
decreased
during
storage
at
0
degrees
C
in
non
-
treated
grapes
but
did
not
change
in
CO2
-
treated
grapes
.

The
up
-
regulation
of
anthocyanin
biosynthesis
gene
expression
and
VcAPX
mRNA
observed
in
non
-
treated
grape
is
not
enhanced
in
CO2
-
treated
grapes
,
which
presented
low
total
decay
.

These
results
point
out
the
ability
of
CO2
-
treated
grapes
to
prevent
the
generation
of
reactive
oxygen
species
rather
than
their
inactivation
by
means
of
induction
of

Candesartan
cilexetil
-
-
a
review
of
effects
on
cardiovascular
complications
in
hypertension
and
chronic
heart
failure
.

UNLABELLED
:
Therapeutic
interventions
that
block
the
renin
-
angiotensin
-
aldosterone
system
(
RAAS
)
have
an
important
role
in
slowing
the
progression
of
cardiovascular
risk
actors
to
established
cardiovascular
diseases
.

In
recent
years
,
angiotensin
receptor
blockers
(
ARBs
)
have
emerged
as
effective
and
well
-
tolerated
alternatives
to
an
angiotensin
-
converting
enzyme
inhibitor
(
ACEi
)
for
RAAS
blockade
.

The
ARB
candesartan
was
initially
established
as
an
effective
once
-
daily
antihypertensive
treatment
,
providing
24
-
h
blood
pressure
(
BP
)
control
with
a
trough
:
peak
ratio
close
to
100
%
.

SCOPE
:
A
Medline
literature
search
was
undertaken
to
identify
randomised
,
controlled
trials
that
examined
the
efficacy
and
cardiovascular
outcomes
associated
with
candesartan
cilexetil
in
hypertension
and
chronic
heart
failure
(
CHF
)
.

FINDINGS
:
Compared
with
other
ARBs
,
candesartan
demonstrates
the
strongest
binding
affinity
to
the
angiotensin
II
type
1
receptor
.

Clinical
trials
have
demonstrated
that
candesartan
is
well
tolerated
in
combination
with
diuretics
or
calcium
channel
blockers
(
CCBs
)
,
making
it
a
suitable
treatment
option
for
patients
whose
hypertension
is
not
adequately
controlled
by
monotherapy
.

Subsequently
,
candesartan
became
the
only
ARB
licensed
in
the
UK
to
treat
patients
with
CHF
and
left
ventricular
ejection
fraction
<
or
=
40
%
as
add
-
on
therapy
to
an
ACEi
or
when
an
ACEi
is
not
tolerated
.

Studies
in
patients
with
symptomatic
HF
have
indicated
that
candesartan
treatment
was
associated
with
significant
relative
risk
reductions
in
cardiovascular
mortality
and
hospitalisation
due
to
CHF
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
There
are
clear
indications
that
the
clinical
benefits
of
candesartan
may
extend
beyond
its
proven
antihypertensive
effects
to
a
wider
range
of
complications
across
the
cardiovascular
continuum
,
including
diabetes
,
left
ventricular
hypertrophy
,
atherosclerosis
and
stroke
.

Such
results
suggest
that
candesartan
treatment
may
offer
significant
patient
benefits
as
well
as
practical
advantages
over
conventional
treatment
.

Apoptosis
induced
by
oxidized
lipids
is
associated
with
up
-
regulation
of
p66Shc
in
intestinal
Caco
-
2
cells
:
protective
effects
of
phenolic
compounds
.

In
this
study
,
we
investigated
the
alterations
of
the
redox
balance
induced
by
the
lipid
fraction
of
oxLDL
in
Caco
-
2
intestinal
cells
,
and
the
effects
of
tyrosol
and
protocatechuic
acid
,
two
dietary
phenolic
compounds
.

We
found
that
oxidized
lipids
extracted
from
oxLDL
(
LipE
)
induced
oxidative
stress
by
determining
,
6
h
after
treatment
,
ROS
overproduction
(
about
a
100
%
and
a
43
%
increase
of
O
*
2
and
H2O2
production
,
respectively
,
P
<
.
05
:
LipE
vs
.
control
)
and
,
12
h
after
treatment
,
GSH
depletion
(
about
a
26
%
decrease
,
P
<
.
05
:
LipE
vs
.
control
)
,
and
by
impairing
the
activities
of
superoxide
dismutase
,
catalase
and
glutathione
peroxidase
.

In
response
to
the
induced
oxidative
stress
,
we
observed
significant
overexpression
of
glutathione
peroxidase
(
6
h
after
treatment
:
P
<
.
05
)
,
glutathione
reductase
and
gamma
-
glutamylcysteine
synthetase
(
12
h
after
treatment
:
P
<
.
05
)
.

Notably
,
when
GSH
depletion
occurred
,
p66Shc
protein
expression
increased
by
about
300
%
with
respect
to
control
(
P
<
.
001
;
LipE
vs
.
control
)
.

These
effects
were
fully
counteracted
by
dietary
phenolics
which
inhibited
ROS
overproduction
and
GSH
consumption
,
rendered
the
reactive
transcription
of
glutathione
-
associated
enzymes
unnecessary
and
blocked
the
intracellular
signals
leading
to
the
overexpression
and
rearrangement
of
p66Shc
signalling
molecule
.

Altogether
,
these
results
suggest
that
the
impairment
of
the
antioxidant
system
hijacks
intestinal
cells
towards
an
apoptotic
-
prone
phenotype
via
the
activation
of
p66Shc
molecule
.

They
also
propose
a
reappraisal
of
dietary
polyphenols
as
intestinal
protecting
agents
,
indicating
the
antiapoptotic
effect
as
a
further
mechanism
of
action
of
these
antioxidant
compounds
.

The

evaluated
the

RESULTS
:
Mean

by

(

relative

In

The

This
was
largely
because
of

CONCLUSIONS
:
Sitagliptin
100

The
addition
of

was
generally
well

,
with
a
modest

Impaired
antibody
synthesis
after
spinal
cord
injury
is
level
dependent
and
is
due
to
sympathetic
nervous
system
dysregulation
.

Individuals
with
spinal
cord
injury
(
SCI
)
are
highly
susceptible
to
infection
.

This
post
-
traumatic
immune
suppression
is
thought
to
occur
via
alterations
in
sympathetic
nervous
system
(
SNS
)
or
hypothalamic
-
pituitary
-
adrenal
(
HPA
)
axis
function
.

Normally
,
the
HPA
axis
and
SNS
help
coordinate
proper
immune
function
.

After
SCI
,
the
HPA
axis
becomes
activated
and
descending
input
to
sympathetic
preganglionic
neurons
(
SPNs
)
is
impaired
.

Because
lymphoid
organs
are
innervated
by
SPNs
distributed
throughout
the
thoracolumbar
spinal
cord
,
we
predicted
level
-
dependent
immune
suppression
after
SCI
due
to
activation
of
the
HPA
axis
and
loss
of
descending
input
to
SPNs
.

We
tested
this
hypothesis
by
measuring
indices
of
HPA
(
circulating
corticosterone
;
CORT
)
and
SNS
function
(
norepinephrine
(
NE
)
in
spleen
)
as
well
as
antigen
-
specific
antibody
synthesis
against
an
exogenous
non
-
self
protein
following
high
-
or
low
-
level
SCI
.

Using
a
mid
-
thoracic
(
T9
)
spinal
contusion
injury
model
,
we
found
that
CORT
was
elevated
after
SCI
with
aberrant
patterns
of
diurnal
CORT
synthesis
evident
through
at
least
the
first
24
h
post
-
injury
.

However
,
splenic
NE
and
antibody
synthesis
were
similar
to
uninjured
controls
.

Injury
severity
did
not
change
these
parameters
.

Indeed
,
CORT
,
NE
and
antibody
synthesis
were
similar
after
T9
contusion
or
transection
SCI
.

In
contrast
,
high
-
level
SCI
(
T3
)
caused
sustained
increases
in
CORT
and
splenic
NE
along
with
impaired
antibody
synthesis
and
elevated
splenocyte
apoptosis
.

The
immunosuppressive
effects
of
T3
SCI
were
caused
by
NE
acting
at
beta2
-
adrenergic
receptors
(
beta2AR
)
and
could
be
reversed
using
beta2AR
blockers
.

Interestingly
,
impaired
antibody
after
T3
SCI
could
be
mimicked
after
T9
SCI
with
a
beta2AR
agonist
.

These
data
illustrate
the
immunosuppressive
effects
of
the
SNS
after
high
-
level
SCI
and
indicate
that
immune
deficits
may
be
overcome
using
beta
-
blockers
.

Linear
copolymers
have
been
developed
which
carry
binding
sites
tailored
for
sulfated
sugars
.

All
binding
monomers
are
based
on
the
methacrylamide
skeleton
and
ensure
statistical
radical
copolymerization
.

They
are
decorated
with
o
-
aminomethylphenylboronates
for
covalent
ester
formation
and
/
or
alkylammonium
ions
for
noncovalent
Coulomb
attraction
.

Alcohol
sidechains
maintain
a
high
water
solubility
;
a
dansyl
monomer
was
constructed
as
a
fluorescence
label
.

Statistical
copolymerization
of
comonomer
mixtures
with
optimized
ratios
was
started
by
AIBN
(
AIBN
=

,

'
-
azoisobutyronitrile
)
and
furnished
water
-
soluble
comonomers
with
an
exceptionally
high
affinity
for
glucosaminoglucans
.

Heparin
can
be
quantitatively
detected
with
an
unprecedented
30
nM
sensitivity
,
and
a
neutral
polymer
without
any
ammonium
cation
is
still
able
to
bind
the
target
with
almost
micromolar
affinity
.

From
this
unexpected
result
,
we
propose
a
new
binding
scheme
between
the
boronate
and
a
sulfated
ethylene
glycol
or
aminoethanol
unit
.

Although
the
mechanism
of
heparin
binding
involves
covalent
boronate
ester
formation
,
it
can
be
completely
reversed
by
protamine
addition
,
similar
to
heparin

s
complex
formation
with

Niemann
-
Pick
disease
type
C
(
NP
-
C
)
is
a
lipid
storage
disorder
characterized
by
the
accumulation
of
unesterified
cholesterol
and
glycolipids
in
the
lysosomal
/
late
endosomal
system
of
certain
cells
in
the
central
nervous
system
(
CNS
)
and
visceral
organs
.

Clinical
symptoms
include
progressive
neurological
deterioration
and
visceral

.

Miglustat
,
a
small
iminosugar
molecule
approved
for
the
treatment
of
Gaucher
disease
,
reversibly
inhibits
glucosylceramide
synthase
,
which
catalyses
the
first
committed
step
in
glycosphingolipid
synthesis
.

The
physicochemical
properties
of
miglustat
allow
it
to
cross
the
blood

brain
barrier
and
suggest
possible
benefits
in
lysosomal

We

Methylphenidate
administration
to
juvenile
rats
alters
brain
areas
involved
in
cognition
,
motivated
behaviors
,
appetite
,
and
stress
.

Thousands
of
children
receive
methylphenidate
(
MPH
;
Ritalin
)
for
attention
deficit
/
hyperactivity
disorder
(
ADHD
)
,
yet
the
long
-
term
neurochemical
consequences
of
MPH
treatment
are
unknown
.

To
mimic
clinical
Ritalin
treatment
in
children
,
male
rats
were
injected
with
MPH
(
5
mg
/
kg
)
or
vehicle
twice
daily
from
postnatal
day
7
(
PND7
)
-
PND35
.

At
the
end
of
administration
(
PND35
)
or
in
adulthood
(
PND135
)
,
brain
sections
from
littermate
pairs
were
immunocytochemically
labeled
for
neurotransmitters
and
cytological
markers
in
16
regions
implicated
in
MPH
effects
and
/
or
ADHD
etiology
.

At
PND35
,
the
medial
prefrontal
cortex
(
mPFC
)
of
rats
given
MPH
showed
55
%
greater
immunoreactivity
(
-
ir
)
for
the
catecholamine
marker
tyrosine
hydroxylase
(
TH
)
,
60
%
more
Nissl
-
stained

,
and
40
%
less
norepinephrine
transporter
(
NET
)
-
ir
density
.

In
hippocampal
dentate
gyrus
,
MPH
-
receiving
rats
showed
a
51
%
decrease
in
NET
-
ir
density
and
a
61
%
expanded
distribution
of
the
new
-
cell
marker
PSA
-
NCAM
(
polysialylated
form
of
neural
cell
adhesion
molecule
)
.

In
medial
striatum
,
TH
-
ir
decreased
by
21
%
,
and
in
hypothalamus
neuropeptide
Y
-
ir
increased
by
10
%
in
MPH
-
exposed
rats
.

At
PND135
,
MPH
-
exposed
rats
exhibited
decreased
anxiety
in
the
elevated
plus
-
maze
and
a
trend
for
decreased
TH
-
ir
in
the
mPFC
.

Neither
PND35
nor
PND135
rats
showed
major
structural
differences
with
MPH
exposure
.

These
findings
suggest
that
developmental
exposure
to
high
therapeutic
doses
of
MPH
has
short
-
term
effects
on
select
neurotransmitters
in
brain
regions
involved
in
motivated
behaviors
,
cognition
,
appetite
,
and
stress
.

Although
the
observed
neuroanatomical
changes
largely
resolve
with
time
,
chronic
modulation
of
young
brains
with
MPH
may
exert
effects
on
brain
neurochemistry
that
modify
some
behaviors
even
in
adulthood
.

Analgesic
and
anti
-
inflammatory
activities
of
aqueous
extract
from
Glycine
tomentella
root
in
mice
.

In
the
present
study
,
we
have
investigated
the
analgesic
effect
of
the
aqueous
extract
of
the
root
of
Glycine
tomentella
(
AGT
)
using
models
of
acetic
acid
-
induced
writhing
response
and
formalin
test
,
the
anti
-
inflammatory
effect
of
AGT
using
model
of
lambda
-
carrageenan
-
induced
paw
edema
.

In
order
to
investigate
the
anti
-
inflammatory
mechanism
of
AGT
,
we
have
detected
the
activities
of
glutathione
peroxidase
(
GPx
)
and
glutathione
reductase
(
GRx
)
in
the
liver
and
the
levels
of
malondialdehyde
(
MDA
)
and
NO
in
the
edema
paw
.

In
the
analgesic
test
,
AGT
(
0
.
5
and
1
.
0
g
/
kg
)
decreased
the
acetic
acid
-
induced
writhing
response
and
the
licking
time
on
the
late
phase
in
the
formalin
test
.

In
the
anti
-
inflammatory
test
,
AGT
(
0
.
5
and
1
.
0
g
/
kg
)
decreased
the
paw
edema
at
the
third
,
fourth
,
fifth
and
sixth
hour
after
lambda
-
carrageenan
administration
,
and
increased
the
activities
of
SOD
,
GPx
and
GRx
in
the
liver
tissue
and
decreased
the
MDA
level
in
the
edema
paw
at
the
third
hour
after
lambda
-
carrageenan
injection
.

However
,
AGT
could
not
affect
the
NO
level
which
induced
by
lambda
-
carrageenan
.

These
results
suggested
that
AGT
possessed
analgesic
and
anti
-
inflammatory
effects
.

The
anti
-
inflammatory
mechanism
of
AGT
might
be
related
to
the
decrease
in
the
level
of
MDA
in
the
edema
paw
via
increasing
the
activities
of
SOD
,
GPx
and
GRx
in
the
liver
.

Thermodynamic
determination
of
the

inhibitors
by
a

.

Somatic
angiotensin
I
-
converting
enzyme
(
s
-
ACE
)
plays
a
central
role
in
blood
pressure
regulation
and
has
been
the
target
of
most
antihypertensive
drugs
.

A
displacement
isothermal
titration
calorimetry
method
has
been
used
to
accurately
determine
the

of
three
strong
s

ACE
inhibitors
.

Under
the
experimental
conditions
studied
in
this
work
,
the
relative
potency
of
the
inhibitors
was
determined
to
be
enalaprilat
>
lisinopril
>
captopril
.

We
analyze
the
thermodynamic
behaviour
of
the
binding
process
using
the
new
structural
information
provided
by
the
ACE
structures
,
as
well
as
the

that
occur
upon

genes
,
which
are
expressed
in

,
catalyze
the
detoxification
of
endogenous

.

Reduced
enzyme
activity
,
due
to
carriage
of
the
GSTM1
deletion
or
the
GSTP1
Ile105Val
Val
allele
,
may
therefore
affect
susceptibility
to
breast
cancer
and
related
conditions
.

In
a
case
-
control
study
of
Chinese
women
,
we
examined
whether
these
polymorphisms
were
associated
with
risk
of
breast
cancer
and
fibrocystic
breast
conditions
.

Women
diagnosed
with
breast
cancer
(
n
=
615
)
or
fibrocystic
breast
conditions
(
n
=
467
)
were
compared
to
women
without
clinical
breast
disease
(
n
=
878
)
.

We
also
examined
whether
these
associations
differed
by
menopausal
status
or
by
presence
of
proliferation
in
the
extra
-
tumoral
epithelium
among
women
with
breast
cancer
and
in
lesions
among
women
with
fibrocystic
conditions
.

No
overall
association
of
either
GST
polymorphism
with
risk
of
breast
cancer
or
fibrocystic
breast
conditions
was
observed
.

There
was
some
evidence
of
slightly
elevated
cancer
risk
associated
with
carriage
of
the
GSTM1
null
genotype
and
at
least
one

)
,
compared
to
carriage
of
the
GSTM1

.

This
relationship
was
stronger
in
women
who
had

.

Our
results
suggest
that
GSTM1
and
GSTP1
genotypes
do
not
individually
influence
susceptibility
to
breast
cancer
or
fibrocystic
breast
conditions
.

The
observed

associated
with
joint

of
the

Inhibition
of

.

We
investigated
the
interactions
between
neutrophils
,
platelets
,
and
artificial
surfaces
,
and
whether
blocking
of
relevant
receptors
on
platelets
reduced
unwanted
activation
responses
in
model
cardiopulmonary

.

Isolated
neutrophils
and
platelets
resuspended
in
heparin

anticoagulated
plasma
were
recirculated
with
and
without
blocking
antibodies
to
CD62P
,

,
or
junctional

molecule
C
(
JAM
-
C
)
in
polyvinyl

tubing
using
a

.

Platelet
adhesion
to
the
tubing
was
inhibited
by
anti

CD42b
and
anti

CD62P
,
and
adhesion
of
neutrophils
by
anti

JAM
-
C
.

Formation
of
platelet
-
neutrophil
and
platelet
aggregates
was
reduced
by
anti

CD62P
.

Anti

JAM
-
C
decreased
platelet
-
neutrophil
aggregation
at
low
concentrations
and
platelet
macroaggregates
at
high
concentrations
.

Anti

CD62P
increased
neutrophil
CD11b
expression
but
not
degranulation
.

Anti
-
JAM
-
C
substantially
increased
neutrophil
degranulation
and
slightly
increased

expression
.

Platelet
activation
increased
when
CD62P
was
blocked
and
decreased
with
anti

antibody
.

High

reduced
platelet

.

In
conclusion
,
inhibiting
platelet

platelet
interactions
had
useful
effects
but
no

blocking
antibody
seemed
capable
of
inducing
only

Bone
growth

in
mouse
embryos
expressing
human
collagenase

.

Cellular
growth
and
differentiation
are
readouts
of
multiple
signaling
pathways
from
the
intercellular
and
/
or
extracellular
milieu
.

The
extracellular
matrix
through
the
activation
of
cellular
receptors
transmits
these
signals
.

Therefore
,
extracellular
matrix
proteolysis
could
affect
cell
fate
in
a
variety
of
biological
events
.

However
,
the
biological
consequence
of
inadequate
extracellular
matrix
degradation
in
vivo
is
not
clear
.

We
developed
a
mouse
model
expressing
human
collagenase
(
matrix

,
MMP
-

)
under
the
control
of

The
mice
showed
significant
growth
retardation
during
embryogenesis
and
a
loss
of
the
demarcation
of
zonal
structure
and
columnar
array
of

.

Immunological
examination
revealed
increased

of
type

collagen
and
upregulation
of
fibronectin
and
alpha

)
-
integrin
subunit
in
the
transgenic

.

The
resting

of
the

exhibited
a
simultaneous

was
not
disturbed
in
the
transgenic
mice
as
evidenced
by
normal
expression
of
the
Ihh
and

.

These
data
demonstrate
that
type

proteolysis
is
an
important

for
the
skeletal

Thus
,
in

were
more

If

IFN

gamma
-
induced
IDO
and
WRS
expression
in
microglia
is
differentially
regulated
by
IL
-
4
.

Indoleamine
2
,
3
-
dioxygenase
(
IDO
)
,
a
tryptophan
catabolizing
enzyme
,
has
been
implicated
in
the
pathogenesis
of
various
neurological
disorders
.

IDO
expression
is
induced
by
IFN
-
gamma
and
leads
to
neurotoxicity
by
generating
quinolinic
acid
.

Additionally
,
it
inhibits
the
immune
response
through
both
tryptophan
depletion
and
generating
other
tryptophan
catabolites
.

IL
-
4
and
IL
-
13
have
been
shown
to
control
IDO
expression
by
antagonizing
the
effects
of
IFN
-
gamma
in
different
cell
types
.

Here
,
we
investigated
the
effects
of
these
cytokines
on
IDO
expression
in
microglia
.

Interestingly
,
we
observed
that
both
IL
-
4
and
IL
-
13
greatly
enhanced
IFN
-
gamma
-
induced
IDO
expression
.

However
,
tryptophanyl
-
tRNA
synthetase
(
WRS
)
,
which
is
coinduced
with
IDO
by
IFN
-
gamma
,
is
downregulated
by
IL
-
4
and
IL
-
13
.

The
effect
of
IL
-
4
and
IL
-
13
was
independent
of
STAT
-
6
.

Modulation
of
IDO
but
not
WRS
was
eliminated
by
inhibition
of
protein
phosphatase
2A
(
PP2A
)
activity
.

The
phosphatidylinositol
3
-
kinase
(
PI3K
)
pathway
further
differentiated
the
regulation
of
these
two
enzymes
,
as
inhibiting
the
PI3K
pathway
eliminated
IFN
-
gamma
induction
of
IDO
,
whereas
such
inhibition
greatly
enhanced
WRS
expression
.

These
findings
show
discordance
between
modulations
of
expression
of
two
distinct
enzymes
utilizing
tryptophan
as
a
common
substrate
,
and
raise
the
possibility
of
their
involvement
in
regulating
immune
responses
in
various
neurological
disorders
.

agonist
(
dexmedetomidine
)
.

BACKGROUND
:
We
recently
showed
that
cocaine
stimulates
the
human
cardiovascular
system
primarily
by
acting
in
the
brain
to
increase
sympathetic
nerve
activity
(
SNA
)
,
the
neural
stimulus
to
norepinephrine
release
.

Thus
,
SNA
constitutes
a
putative
new
drug
target
to
block
cocaine
'
s
adverse
cardiovascular
effects
at
their
origin
.

METHODS
:
In
22
healthy
cocaine
-
naive
humans
,
we
measured
skin
SNA
(
microneurography
)
and
skin
blood
flow
(
laser
Doppler
velocimetry
)
as
well
as
heart
rate
and
blood
pressure
before
and
after
intranasal
cocaine
(
2
mg
/
kg
)
alone
and
in
combination
with
dexmedetomidine
or
saline
.

RESULTS
:
During
intranasal
cocaine
alone
,
SNA
increased
by
2

fold
and
skin
vascular
resistance
increased
from

heart
rate
by

/
-

(

)
.

Dexmedetomidine
abolished
these
increases
,
whereas
intravenous
saline
was
without
effect
.

Dexmedetomidine
was
effective
in
blocking
these
sympathomimetic
actions
of
cocaine
even
in
all
7
subjects
who
were
homozygous
for
the
Del322

325
polymorphism
in
the
alpha2C
AR
,
a
loss

mutation
that
is
highly
enriched
in
blacks
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
The
data
advance
the
novel
hypothesis
that
central
sympatholysis
with
dexmedetomidine
constitutes
a
highly
effective
countermeasure
for
cocaine
'
s
sympathomimetic
actions
on
the
human
cardiovascular
system
,
even
in
individuals
carrying
the
alpha2CDel322
-

polymorphism

Acetaminophen
(
paracetamol
)
is
a
selective
cyclooxygenase
-
2
inhibitor
in
man
.

For
more
than
three
decades
,
acetaminophen
(
INN
,
paracetamol
)
has
been
claimed
to
be
devoid
of
significant
inhibition
of
peripheral
prostanoids
.

Meanwhile
,
attempts
to
explain
its
action
by
inhibition
of
a
central
cyclooxygenase
(
COX
)
-
3
have
been
rejected
.

The
fact
that
acetaminophen
acts
functionally
as
a
selective
COX
-
2
inhibitor
led
us
to
investigate
the
hypothesis
of
whether
it
works
via
preferential
COX
-
2
blockade
.

Ex
vivo
COX
inhibition
and
pharmacokinetics
of
acetaminophen
were
assessed
in
5
volunteers
receiving
single
1000
mg
doses
orally
.

Coagulation
-
induced
thromboxane
B
(
2
)
and
lipopolysaccharide
-
induced
prostaglandin
E
(

)
were
measured
ex
vivo
and
in
vitro
in
human
whole
blood
as
indices
of
COX
-
1
and
COX
-
2
activity
.

In
vitro
,
acetaminophen
elicited
a
4

fold
selectivity
toward
COX
-
2
inhibition
(

.

Following
oral
administration
of
the
drug
,
maximal
ex

inhibitions
were
56
%
(
COX

)
and
83
%
(
COX

)
.

Acetaminophen
plasma
concentrations
remained
above
the
in

IC
(

for
COX
-

for
at
least
5
h
postadministration
.

Ex

2
micromol

;
COX

3
micromol
/
L
)
of
acetaminophen
compared
favorably
with
its
in
vitro
IC
(
50
)
values
.

In
contrast
to
previous
concepts
,
acetaminophen
inhibited
COX
-
2
by
more
than
80
%
,
i
.
e
.
,
to
a
degree
comparable
to
nonsteroidal
antiinflammatory
drugs
(
NSAIDs
)
and
selective
COX
-
2
inhibitors
.

However
,
a
>
95
%
COX
-
1
blockade
relevant
for
suppression
of
platelet
function
was
not
achieved
.

Our
data
may
explain
acetaminophen
'
s
analgesic
and
antiinflammatory
action
as
well
as
its
superior
overall
gastrointestinal
safety
profile
compared
with
NSAIDs
.

In
view
of
its
substantial
COX
-
2
inhibition
,
recently
defined
cardiovascular
warnings
for
use
of
COX
-
2
inhibitors
should
also
be
considered
for
acetaminophen
.

Na
+
/
Ca2
+
exchange
inhibitors
:
a
new
class
of
calcium
regulators
.

The
Na
(
+
)
/
Ca
(
2
+
)
exchanger
(
NCX
)
is
a
bidirectional
transporter
that
normally
extrudes
Ca
(
2
+
)
from
the
cell
(
forward
mode
)
,
but
also
brings
Ca
(
2
+
)
into
the
cell
(
reverse
mode
)
under
special
conditions
such
as
intracellular
Na
(
+
)
(
Na
(
+
)
(
i
)
)
accumulation
or
membrane
depolarization
.

There
are
three
mammalian
NCX
isoforms
:
NCX1
is
widely
expressed
in
the
heart
,
kidney
,
brain
,
blood
vessels
,
and
so
on
;
whereas
the
expression
of
NCX2
and
NCX3
is
limited
mainly
to
the
brain
and
skeletal
muscle
.

The
pharmacology
of
NCX
inhibitors
has
been
studied
extensively
since
the
development
of
KB
-
R7943
,
a
prototype
benzyloxyphenyl
NCX
inhibitor
,
in
1996
.

Currently
,
experiments
are
actively
progressing
with
more
selective
inhibitors
:
SEA0400
,
SN
-
6
,
and
YM
-
244769
.

Intriguingly
,
the
inhibitory
potency
of
benzyloxyphenyl
NCX
inhibitors
is
directly
coupled
to
the
rate
of
Na
(
+
)
(
i
)
-
dependent
inactivation
.

Therefore
,
the
benzyloxyphenyl
inhibitors
are
apparently
dormant
during
the
forward
mode
under
normal
conditions
(
low
Na
(
+
)
(
i
)
)
,
but
become
effective
during
the
reverse
mode
under
pathological
conditions
(
high
Na
(
+
)
(
i
)
)
.

This
should
be
an
ideal
profile
for
calcium
regulators
against
Na
(
+
)
(
i
)
-
related
diseases
,
such
as
ischemia
/
reperfusion
injuries
,
salt
-
dependent
hypertension
,
and
digitalis
arrhythmia
.

Existing
ion
channel
blockers
,
such
as
amiodarone
,
dronedarone
,
bepridil
,
aprindine
,
and
cibenzoline
,
have
been
found
to
have
an
NCX
inhibitory
action
.

It
is
possible
that
this
property
is
partly
responsible
for
their
antiarrhythmic
and
cardioprotective
effects
.

This
article
presents
the
characteristics
of
selective
and
non
-
selective
NCX
inhibitors
and
their
therapeutic
potential
as
a
new
calcium

Conivaptan
:
a
dual
vasopressin
receptor
v1a
/
v2
antagonist
[
corrected
]
.

Several
fluid
retentive
states
such
as
heart
failure
,
cirrhosis
of
the
liver
,
and
syndrome
of
inappropriate
antidiuretic
hormone
secretion
are
associated
with
inappropriate
elevation
in
plasma
levels
of
arginine
vasopressin
(
AVP
)
,
a
neuropeptide
that
is
secreted
by
the
hypothalamus
and
plays
a
critical
role
in
the
regulation
of
serum
osmolality
and
in
circulatory
homeostasis
.

The
actions
of
AVP
are
mediated
by
three
receptor
subtypes
V1a
,
V2
,
and
V1b
.

The
V1a
receptor
regulates
vasodilation
and
cellular
hypertrophy
while
the
V2
receptor
regulates
free
water
excretion
.

The
V1b
receptor
regulates
adrenocorticotropin
hormone
release
.

Conivaptan
is
a
nonpeptide
dual
V1a
/
V2
AVP
receptor
antagonist
.

It
binds
with
high
affinity
,
competitively
,
and
reversibly
to
the
V1a
/
V2
receptor
subtypes
;
its
antagonistic
effect
is
concentration
dependent
.

It
inhibits
CYP3A4
liver
enzyme
and
elevates
plasma
levels
of
other
drugs
metabolized
by
this
enzyme
.

It
is
approved
only
for
short
-
term
intravenous
use
.

Infusion
site
reaction
is
the
most
common
reason
for
discontinuation
of
the
drug
.

In
animals
conivaptan
increased
urine
volume
and
free
water
clearance
.

In
heart
failure
models
it
improved
hemodynamic
parameters
and
free
water
excretion
.

Conivaptan
has
been
shown
to
correct
hyponatremia
in
euvolemic
or
hypervolemic
patients
.

Its
efficacy
and
safety
for
short
-
term
use
have
led
to
the
Food
and
Drug
Administration
(
FDA
)
approval
of
its
intravenous
form
for
the
correction
of
hyponatremia
in
euvolemic
and
hypervolemic
states
.

Despite
its
ability
to
block
the
action
of
AVP
on
V1a
receptors
,
no
demonstrable
benefit
from
this
action
was
noted
in
patients
with
chronic
compensated
heart
failure
and
it
is
not
approved
for
this
indication
.

Consideration
should
be
given
to
further
evaluation
of
its
potential
benefits
in
patients
with
acute
decompensated
heart
failure
.

Kinetic
characterization
of
adenylosuccinate
synthetase
from
the
thermophilic
archaea
Methanocaldococcus
jannaschii
.

Adenylosuccinate
synthetase
(
AdSS
)
catalyzes
the
Mg2
+
dependent
condensation
of
a
molecule
of
IMP
with
aspartate
to
form
adenylosuccinate
,
in
a
reaction
driven
by
the
hydrolysis
of
GTP
to
GDP
.

AdSS
from
the
thermophilic
archaea
,
Methanocaldococcus
jannaschii
(
MjAdSS
)
is
345
amino
acids
long
against
an
average
length
of
430
-
457
amino
acids
for
most
mesophilic
AdSS
.

This
short
AdSS
has
two
large
deletions
that
map
to
the
middle
and
C
-
terminus
of
the
protein
.

This
article
discusses
the
detailed
kinetic
characterization
of
MjAdSS
.

Initial
velocity
and
product
inhibition
studies
,
carried
out
at
70
degrees
C
,
suggest
a
rapid
equilibrium
random
AB
steady
-
state
ordered
C
kinetic
mechanism
for
the
MjAdSS
catalyzed
reaction
.

AdSS
are
known
to
exhibit
monomer
-
dimer
equilibrium
with
the
dimer
being
implicated
in
catalysis
.

In
contrast
,
our
studies
show
that
MjAdSS
is
an
equilibrium
mixture
of
dimers
and
tetramers
with
the
tetramer
being
the
catalytically
active
form
.

The
tetramer
dissociates
into
dimers
with
a
minor
increase
in
ionic
strength
of
the
buffer
,
while
the
dimer
is
extremely
stable
and
does
not
dissociate
even
at
1
.
2
M
NaCl
.

Phosphate
,
a
product
of
the
reaction
,
was
found
to
be
a
potent
inhibitor
of
MjAdSS
showing
biphasic
inhibition
of
enzyme
activity
.

The
inhibition
was
competitive
with
IMP
and
noncompetitive
with
GTP
.

MjAdSS
,
like
the
mouse
acidic
isozyme
,
exhibits
substrate
inhibition
,
with
IMP
inhibiting
enzyme
activity
at
subsaturating
GTP
concentrations
.

Regulation
of
enzyme
activity
by
the
glycolytic
intermediate
,
fructose
1
,
6
bisphosphate
,
was
also
observed
with
the
inhibition
being
competitive
with
IMP
and
noncompetitive
against
GTP
.

Conformational
variations
of
both
phosphodiesterase
-
5
and
inhibitors
provide
the
structural
basis
for
the
physiological
effects
of
vardenafil
and
sildenafil
.

Vardenafil
has
higher
affinity
to
phosphodiesterase
-
5
(
PDE5
)
than
sildenafil
and
lower
administered
dosage
for
the
treatment
of
erectile
dysfunction
.

However
,
the
molecular
basis
for
these
differences
is
puzzling
because
two
drugs
have
similar
chemical
structures
.

Reported
here
is
a
crystal
structure
of
the
fully
active
and
nonmutated
PDE5A1
catalytic
domain
in
complex
with
vardenafil
.

The
structure
shows
that
the
conformation
of
the
H
-
loop
in
the
PDE5A1
-
vardenafil
complex
is
different
from
those
of
any
known
structures
of
the
unliganded
PDE5
and
its
complexes
with
the
inhibitors
.

In
addition
,
the
molecular
configuration
of
vardenafil
differs
from
that
of
sildenafil
when
bound
to
PDE5
.

It
is
noteworthy
that
the
binding
of
vardenafil
causes
loss
of
the
divalent
metal
ions
that
have
been
observed
in
all
the
previously
published
PDE
structures
.

The
conformational
variation
of
both
PDE5
and
the
inhibitors
provides
structural
insight
into
the
different
potencies
of
the
drugs
.

Introduction
:
The
pharmacological
profile
of
eprosartan
-
-
implications
for
cerebrovascular
and
cardiovascular
risk
reduction
.

Moderate
elevations
in
blood
pressure
translate
to
significant
increases
in
cardiovascular
and
cerebro
vascular
risk
.

Beneficially
,
this
relationship
allows
small
decreases
in
blood
pressure
to
be
associated
with
risk
reduction
.

Both
the
renin
-
angiotensin
system
and
the
sympathetic
nervous
system
are
involved
in
hypertension
,
hence
targeting
these
systems
is
likely
to
be
of
benefit
in
the
treatment
of
hypertension
.

Angiotensin
II
type
1
receptor
blockers
(
ARBs
)
are
used
for
controlling
blood
pressure
and
treating
heart
failure
in
a
broad
range
of
patients
,
including
those
with
diabetes
and
the
elderly
.

Not
only
have
ARBs
shown
good
efficacy
and
tolerability
,
they
also
appear
to
have
a
protective
effect
that
goes
beyond
that
expected
from
the
reduction
of
blood
pressure
.

The
ARB
eprosartan
is
a
nonbiphenyl
nontetrazole
angiotensin
II
type
1
receptor
(
AT1
)
antagonist
,
which
acts
to
decrease
total
peripheral
resistance
.

Eprosartan
acts
at
vascular
AT1
receptors
(
postsynaptically
)
and
at
presynaptic
AT1
receptors
,
where
it
inhibits
noradrenaline
release
.

In
clinical
studies
,
eprosartan
has
been
shown
to
significantly
reduce
cardiovascular
and
cerebrovascular
events
,
whilst
avoiding
the
persistent
cough
that
commonly
occurs
with
the
use
of
angiotensin
-
converting
enzyme
inhibitors
.

Eprosartan
can
also
be
differentiated
from
other
ARBs
due
to
its
noradrenergic
effects
,
which
other
ARBs
used
at
therapeutic
doses
do
not
possess
.

Eprosartan
,
therefore
,
represents
a
useful
therapeutic
option
in
the
management
of
patients
with
hypertension
,
including
those
with
a
history
of
stroke
or
with
co
-
morbid
type
2
diabetes
mellitus
.

Covalent
modification
of
stathmin
by
CCNU
determined
by
FTMS
analysis
of
modified
proteins
and
tryptic
peptides
.

Chemical
modification
of
proteins
is
often
carried
out
to
generate
protein
-
small
molecule
conjugates
for
various
applications
.

The
high
resolution
and
mass
accuracy
of
a
Fourier
transform
mass
spectrometer
is
particularly
useful
for
assessing
the
extent
or
sites
of
covalent
modifications
.

As
protein
-
small
molecule
reactions
often
produce
products
with
variable
numbers
of
the
compound
incorporated
at
different
sites
,
a
direct
mass
analysis
of
the
reaction
products
at
times
yields
mass
spectra
hard
to
interpret
.

Chromatographic
separation
at
protein
level
could
reduce
the
complexity
of
a
sample
,
thus
allowing
more
accurate
mass
spectrometric
analysis
.

In
this
report
,
we
demonstrate
the
utility
of
reversed
-
phase
protein
chromatography
and
FT
-
ICR
mass
spectrometry
in
analyzing
CCNU
(
lomustine

)
modification
of
stathmin
.

With
this
combined
approach
,
we
determined
the
stoichiometry
as
well
as
sites
of
CCNU
incorporation
into
the
protein
,
demonstrating
differential
reactivity
of
several
lysyl
residues
to
CCNU
alkylation
.

Phosphodiesterase
4
inhibitors
delay
human
eosinophil
and
neutrophil
apoptosis
in
the
absence
and
presence
of
salbutamol
.

In
asthma
and
chronic
obstructive
pulmonary
disease
(
COPD
)
,
the
number
of
eosinophils
and
neutrophils
in
the
lung
is
increased
.

One
described
mechanism
leading
to
the
impaired
clearance
of
these
cells
from
the
lung
is
the
delay
in
their
programmed
cell
death
(
apoptosis
)
.

Selective
inhibitors
of
phosphodiesterases
(
PDEs
)
are
under
development
for
the
treatment
of
lung
diseases
because
of
their
anti
-
inflammatory
and
bronchodilator
activity
.

The
aim
of
the
present
study
was
to
establish
whether
inhibitors
of
PDE3
,
PDE4
and
PDE5
modulate
human
eosinophil
or
neutrophil
apoptosis
or
beta
2
-
adrenoceptor
agonist
-
or
cytokine
-
afforded
survival
.

We
also
evaluated
whether
a
PDE4
inhibitor
could
modulate
the
effect
of
a
corticosteroid
on
eosinophil
and
neutrophil
apoptosis
.

Apoptosis
was
measured
by
using
the
relative
DNA
fragmentation
assay
and
Annexin
-
V
binding
.

Inhibitors
of
PDE4
(
rolipram
;
0
.
1
-
10
microM
)
and
PDE3
(
cilostazol
;
0
.
1
-
10
microM
)
delayed
spontaneous
eosinophil
apoptosis
maximally
by
25
%
and
15
%
,
respectively
.

A
combination
of
a
PDE4
or
PDE3
inhibitor
(
10
microM
)
with
salbutamol
(
100
nM
)
further
delayed
eosinophil
apoptosis
maximally
by
42
-
49
%
.

In
neutrophils
,
rolipram
(
10
microM
)
also
decreased
apoptosis
with
a
maximal
inhibition
of
13
%
.

The
combination
of
rolipram
(
10
microM
)
and
salbutamol
(
100
nM
)
produced
a
27
%
inhibition
of
neutrophil
apoptosis
.

Inhibitor
of
cGMP
-
specific
PDE5
(
zaprinast
;
0
.
1
-
10
microM
)
did
not
affect
eosinophil
apoptosis
and
only
slightly
increased
spontaneous
neutrophil
apoptosis
.

The
effect
of
budesonide
on
apoptosis
was
not
significantly
modulated
by
a
PDE4
inhibitor
in
eosinophils
or
neutrophils
.

The
present
results
show
that
selective
inhibitors
of
cAMP
-
hydrolyzing
PDEs
(
PDE3
and
PDE4
)
delay
eosinophil
apoptosis
and
,
thus
,
increase
their
survival
in
vitro
.

Furthermore
,
beta
2
-
adrenoceptor
agonists
enhance
the
anti
-
apoptotic
effects
of
PDE3
and
PDE4
inhibitors
,
suggesting
that
such
drug
combinations
may
prolong
eosinophil
and
neutrophil
longevity
in
the
lung
.

Statins
increase
p21
through
inhibition
of
histone
deacetylase
activity
and
release
of
promoter
-
associated
HDAC1
/
2
.

Statins
are
3
-
hydroxy
-
3
-
methylglutaryl
-
CoA
reductase
inhibitors
broadly
used
for
the
control
of
hypercholesterolemia
.

Recently
,
they
are
reported
to
have
beneficial
effects
on
certain
cancers
.

In
this
study
,
we
show
that
statins
inhibited
the
histone
deacetylase
(
HDAC
)
activity
and
increased
the
accumulation
of
acetylated
histone
-
H3
and
the
expression
of
p21
(
WAF
/
CIP
)
in
human
cancer
cells
.

Computational
modeling
showed
the
direct
interaction
of
the
carboxylic
acid
moiety
of
statins
with
the
catalytic
site
of
HDAC2
.

In
the
subsequent
enzymatic
assay
,
it
was
shown
that
lovastatin
inhibited
HDAC2
activity
competitively
with
a
K
(
i
)
value
of
31
.
6
micromol
/
L
.

Sp1
but
not
p53
sites
were
found
to
be
the
statins
-
responsive
element
shown
by
p21
luciferase
-
promoter
assays
.

DNA
affinity
protein
binding
assay
and
chromatin
immunoprecipitation
assay
showed
the
dissociation
of
HDAC1
/
2
and
association
of
CBP
,
leading
to
the
histone
-
H3
acetylation
on
the
Sp1
sites
of
p21
promoter
.

In
vitro
cell
proliferation
and
in
vivo
tumor
growth
were
both
inhibited
by
statins
.

These
results
suggest
a
novel
mechanism
for
statins
through
abrogation
of
the
HDAC
activity
and
promoter
histone
-
H3
acetylation
to
regulate
p21
expression
.

Therefore
,
statins
might
serve
as
novel
HDAC
inhibitors
for
cancer
therapy
and
chemoprevention
.

Flavopiridol

a
synthetic
flavonoid
based
on
an
extract

for
the
potential

A
phase

trial
,
in
collaboration
with
the
National
Cancer
Institute
,
has
commenced
at
the
University
of
Chicago
Medical
Center
,
which
involves
patients
with
high

changes
was
seen
at
concentrations
greater

In

pharmacokinetic
studies
have
shown
that
flavopiridol
undergoes
hepatic
biotransformation
to
its
corresponding
glucoronide
by
uridine
diphosphate
glucoronosyltransferases
[

Optimization
of
taxane
binding
to
microtubules
:
binding
affinity
dissection
and
incremental
construction
of
a
high
-
affinity
analog
of
paclitaxel
.

The
microtubule
binding
affinities
of
a
series
of
synthetic
taxanes
have
been
measured
with
the
aims
of
dissecting
individual
group
contributions
and
obtaining
a
rationale
for
the
design
of
novel
compounds
with
the
ability
to
overcome
drug
resistance
.

As
previously
observed
for
epothilones
,
the
positive
and
negative
contributions
of
the
different
substituents
to
the
binding
free
energies
are
cumulative
.

By
combining
the
most
favorable
substitutions
we
increased
the
binding
affinity
of
paclitaxel
500
-
fold
.

Insight
into
the
structural
basis
for
this
improvement
was
gained
with
molecular
modeling
and
NMR
data
obtained
for
microtubule
-
bound
docetaxel
.

Taxanes
with
affinities
for
microtubules
well
above
their
affinities
for
P
-
glycoprotein
are
shown
not
to
be
affected
by
multidrug
resistance
.

This
finding
strongly
indicates
that
optimization
of
the
ligand
-
target
interaction
is
a
good
strategy
to
overcome
multidrug
resistance
mediated
by
efflux
pumps
.

Synergy
between
pairs
of
competitive
antagonists
at
adult
human
muscle
acetylcholine
receptors
.

BACKGROUND
:
Synergistic
neuromuscular
blocking
effects
have
been
observed
clinically
with
certain
pairs
of
nicotinic
acetylcholine
receptor
(
nAChR
)
competitive
antagonists
.

The
mechanism
for
synergy
has
not
been
elucidated
.

We
tested
the
hypothesis
that
synergy
arises
from
a
differential
selectivity
of
antagonists
for
the
two
ligand
binding
sites
on
adult
human
nAChR
.

METHODS
:
We
expressed
nAChR
in
BOSC23
cells
.

We
applied
ACh
with
or
without
antagonists
to
outside
-
out
patches
and
measured
macroscopic
currents
at
room
temperature
.

We
determined
the
IC
(
90
)
for
(
+
)
-
tubocurarine
,
metocurine
,
pancuronium
,
vecuronium
,
cisatracurium
,
rocuronium
,
and
atracurium
.

For
15
combinations
of
two
antagonists
,
we
determined
the
IC
(
90
)
for
one
antagonist
in
the
presence
of
the
IC
(
70
)
of
a
second
antagonist
.

We
constructed
isobolograms
for
90
%
inhibition
.

For
single
antagonists
,
we
measured
inhibition
of
receptors
containing
mutations
in
the
epsilon
-
and
delta
-
subunits
to
determine
site
selectivity
.

RESULTS
:
Two
pairs
of
antagonists
,
metocurine
+
cisatracurium
and
cisatracurium
+
atracurium
exhibited
additive
inhibition
.

Ten
combinations
,
including
(
+
)
-
tubocurarine
+
pancuronium
and
pancuronium
+
vecuronium
,
were
highly
synergistic
such
that
the
combination
was
two
to
three
times
more
effective
than
expected
for
additivity
.

Three
combinations
were
1
.
5
-
1
.
6
times
more
effective
than
expected
for
additivity
.

Inhibition
by
(
+
)
-
tubocurarine
and
metocurine
was
sensitive
to
mutations
in
the
epsilon
-
subunit
only
.

Vecuronium
was
affected
by
the
delta
-
subunit
mutation
only
.

Inhibition
by
other
antagonists
was
decreased
by
mutations
in
either
subunit
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
Many
combinations
of
antagonists
exhibited
synergistic
effects
on
adult
human
nAChR
.

Synergy
was
observed
with
structurally
similar
and
dissimilar
antagonists
.

The
degree
of
synergy
did
not
always
correlate
well
with
site
specificity
assayed
with
mutants
.

In
some
,
but
not
all
cases
,
the
synergy
at
the
receptor
level
correlated
with
clinical
determinations
of
synergy
.

We
conclude
that
the
synergistic
actions
of
muscle
relaxants
can
be
partially
explained
by
direct
interactions
with
adult
human
nAChR
.

Formoterol
in
the
management
of
chronic
obstructive
pulmonary
disease
.

Bronchodilators
represent
the
hallmark
of
symptomatic
treatment
of
Chronic
Obstructive
Pulmonary
Disease
(
COPD
)
.

There
are
four
categories
of
bronchodilators
:
anticholinergics
,
methylxanthines
,
short
-
acting
beta2
-
agonists
,
and
long
-
acting
beta2
-
agonists
such
as
formoterol
.

Significant
research
has
been
performed
to
investigate
the
efficacy
,
safety
and
tolerability
of
formoterol
in
the
therapeutic
field
of
COPD
.

Formoterol
exhibits
a
rapid
onset
of
bronchodilation
similar
to
that
observed
with
salbutamol
,
yet
its
long
bronchodilatory
duration
is
comparable
to
salmeterol
.

In
addition
,
formoterol
presents
with
a
clear
superiority
in
lung
function
improvement
compared
with
either
ipratropium
bromide
or
oral
theophylline
,
while
its
efficacy
improves
when
administered
in
combination
with
ipratropium
.

Formoterol
has
been
shown
to
better
reduce
dynamic
hyperinflation
,
which
is
responsible
for
exercise
intolerance
and
dyspnea
in
COPD
patients
,
compared
with
other
bronchodilators
,
whereas
it
exerts
synergistic
effect
with
tiotropium
.

Moreover
,
formoterol
reduces
exacerbations
,
increases
days
free
of
use
of
rescue
medication
and
improves
patients
'
quality
of
life
and
disease
symptoms
.

Formoterol
has
a
favorable
safety
profile
and
is
better
tolerated
than
theophylline
.

Collectively
,
data
extracted
from
multicenter
clinical
trials
support
formoterol
as
a
valid
therapeutic
option
in
the
treatment
of
COPD
.

ABCB1
polymorphisms
influence
steady
-
state
plasma
levels
of
9
-
hydroxyrisperidone
and
risperidone
active
moiety
.

Risperidone
is
metabolized
to
its
active
metabolite
,
9
-
hydroxyrisperidone
,
mainly
by
the
cytochrome
P450
enzymes
CYP2D6
and
3A4
.

Its
antipsychotic
effect
is
assumed
to
be
related
to
the
active
moiety
,
that
is
,
the
sum
of
risperidone
and
9
-
hydroxyrisperidone
.

Both
risperidone
and
9
-
hydroxyrisperidone
are
substrates
of
P
-
glycoprotein
(
P
-
gp
)
,
a
transport
protein
involved
in
drug
absorption
,
distribution
,
and
elimination
.

The
aim
of
the
present
study
was
to
evaluate
the
influence
of
polymorphisms
in
genes
encoding
CYP3A5
and
P

(
ABCB1
)
on
the
steady

state
plasma
levels
of
risperidone
,
9
-
hydroxyrisperidone
,
and
the
active
moiety
,
taking
CYP2D6
genotype
status
into
account
.

Forty
-
six
white
patients
with
schizophrenia
treated
with
risperidone
(
1
-
10
mg

)
in
monotherapy
for
4
-
6
weeks
were
genotyped
,
and
their
plasma
concentrations
of
risperidone
and
9

hydroxyrisperidone
were
measured
.

Dose
-
corrected
plasma
concentrations
(
C
/
D
)
of
risperidone
,
9
-
hydroxyrisperidone
,
and
active
moiety
showed
up
to
68
-
,
9
-
,
and
10
-
fold
interindividual
variation
,
respectively
.

Six
patients
carried
1
CYP3A5
*
1
allele
and
therefore
were
likely
to
express
the
CYP3A5
enzyme
.

The
CYP3A5
genotype
did
not
influence
risperidone
,
9
-
hydroxyrisperidone
,
or
active
moiety
C
/
Ds
.

The
CYP2D6
genotype
in
these
46
patients
was
again
associated
with
risperidone
C
/
D
(
P
=

)
but
not

,
our
results
confirmed
the
significant
effect
of
CYP2D6

pathway
provides
medulloblastoma
therapeutic
targets
.

Prostaglandin
E
(
2
)
(
PGE
(
2
)
)
has
been
shown
to
play
important
roles
in
several
aspects
of
tumor
development
and
progression
.

PGE
(
2
)
is
synthesized
from
arachidonic
acid
by
cyclooxygenases
(
COX
)
and
prostaglandin
E
synthases
(
PGES
)
and
mediates
its
biological
activity
through
binding
to
the
four
prostanoid
receptors
EP
(
1
)
through
EP
(
4
)
.

In
this
study
,
we
show
for
the
first
time
that
medulloblastoma
(
MB
)
,
the
most
common
malignant
childhood
brain
tumor
,
expresses
high
levels
of
COX
-
2
,
microsomal
prostaglandin
E
synthase
-
1
,
and
EP
(
1
)
through
EP
(
4
)
and
secretes
PGE
(
2
)
.

PGE
(
2
)
and
the
EP
(
2
)
receptor
agonist
butaprost
stimulated
MB
cell
proliferation
.

Treatment
of
MB
cells
with
COX
inhibitors
suppressed
PGE
(
2
)
production
and
induced
caspase
-
dependent
apoptosis
.

Similarly
,
specific
COX
-
2
silencing
by
small
interfering
RNA
inhibited
MB
cell
growth
.

EP
(

)
and
EP
(

)
receptor
antagonists
ONO

,
but
not
the
EP
(

)
antagonists
ONO
-
AE3
-
208
and
AH
23848
,
inhibited
tumor
cell
proliferation
,
indicating
the
significance
of
EP
(
1
)
and
EP
(
3
)
but
not
EP
(
4
)
for
MB
growth
.

Administration
of
COX
inhibitors
at
clinically
achievable
nontoxic
concentrations
significantly
inhibited
growth
of
established
human
MB
xenografts
.

Apoptosis
was
increased
,
proliferation
was
reduced
,
and
angiogenesis
was
inhibited
in
MBs
treated
with
COX
inhibitors
.

This
study
suggests
that
PGE
(
2
)
is
important
for
MB
growth
and
that
therapies
targeting
the
prostanoid
metabolic
pathway
are
potentially
beneficial
and
should
be
tested
in
clinical
settings
for
treatment
of
children
with
MB
.

Plerixafor
,
a
CXCR4
antagonist
for
the
mobilization
of
hematopoietic
stem
cells
.

Stem
cells
harvested
from
peripheral
blood
are
the
most
commonly
used
graft
source
in
hematopoietic
stem
cell
transplantation
.

While
G
-
CSF
is
the
most
frequently
used
agent
for
stem
cell
mobilization
,
the
use
of
G
-
CSF
alone
results
in
suboptimal
stem
cell
yields
in
a
significant
proportion
of
patients
undergoing
autologous
transplantation
.

Plerixafor
(
AMD3100
,
Genzyme
Corporation
)
is
a
bicyclam
molecule
that
antagonizes
the
binding
of
the
chemokine
stromal
cell
-
derived
factor
-
1
(
SDF
-
1
)
to
its
cognate
receptor
CXCR4
.

Plerixafor
results
in
the
rapid
and
reversible
mobilization
of
hematopoietic
stem
cells
into
the
peripheral
circulation
and
is
synergistic
when
combined
with
G
-
CSF
.

In
clinical
studies
of
autologous
stem
cell
transplantation
,
the
combination
of
plerixafor
and
G
-
CSF
allows
the
collection
of
large
numbers
of
stem
cells
in
fewer
apheresis
sessions
and
can
salvage
those
who
fail

Pharmacological
effects
of
a
mu
-
opioid
receptor
antagonist
naltrexone
on
alcohol
dependence
]
.

Alcohol
is
one
of
the
most
commonly
abused
substances
,
and
its
chronic
intake
leads
to
the
development
of
ethanol
dependence
in
both
humans
and
laboratory
animals
.

In
many
countries
,
a
mu
-
opioid
receptor
antagonist
naltrexone
has
been
used
in
the
treatment
of
alcohol
dependence
.

The
introduction
of
naltrexone
for
the
treatment
of
alcohol
dependence
has
been
mainly
based
on
behavioral
animal
models
that
provide
evidence
of
the
involvement
of
the
endogenous
opioid
system
in
alcohol
drinking
and
dependence
.

It
has
been
well
known
that
alcohol
leads
to
the
activation
of
the
endogenous
opioid
system
.

The
endogenous
opioid
agonists
,
such
as
beta
-
endorphin
,
increase
the
activity
of
the
mesolimbic
dopaminergic
system
through
the
inhibition
of
the
gamma
-
aminobutyric
acid
(
GABA
)
-
containing
inhibitory
interneurons
in
the
ventral
tegmental
area
,
resulting
in
the
expression
of
alcohol
reinforcement
and
/
or
rewarding
effect
.

Therefore
,
naltrexone
,
which
is
useful
for
alcohol
dependence
therapy
,
may
attenuate
the
rewarding
effect
of
ethanol
by
interfering
with
the
ethanol
-
induced
stimulation
of
the
mesolimbic
dopaminergic
system
.

The
following
review
provides
a
summary
of
the
interactions
between
endogenous
opioid
system
and
mesolimbic
dopaminergic
system
in
alcohol
dependence
.

Neurochemical
effects
of
the
monoamine
oxidase
inhibitor
phenelzine
on
brain
GABA
and
alanine
:
A
comparison
with
vigabatrin
.

PURPOSE
:
To
compare
phenelzine
(
PLZ
)
,
an
antidepressant
drug
with
anxiolytic
properties
which
inhibits
monoamine
oxidase
(
MAO
)
but
also
elevates
rat
brain
levels
of
the
amino
acids
?
-
aminobutyric
acid
(
GABA
)
and
alanine
(
ALA
)
,
with
vigabatrin
(
VIG
)
,
an
anticonvulsant
which
elevates
brain
GABA
by
inhibition
of
GABA
transaminase
(
GABA
-
T
)
,
with
regard
to
their
actions
on
brain
levels
of
GABA
and
ALA
and
on
activities
of
MAO
,
GABA
-
T
and
ALA
transaminase
(
ALA
-
T
)
.

METHODS
:
Male
rats
were
administered
PLZ
(
10
mg
/
kg
)
or
VIG
(
1
,
000
mg
/
kg
)
i
.
p
.
,
and
the
rats
were
euthanized
4
hours
later
and
the
brains
removed
for
analysis
of
levels
of
GABA
and
ALA
(
by
electron
capture
gas
chromatography
after
derivatization
)
and
activities
of
MAO
,
GABA
-
T
and
ALA
-
T
(
radiochemical
assays
)
.

RESULTS
:
Both
PLZ
and
VIG
inhibited
GABA
-
T
and
elevated
GABA
levels
.

Only
PLZ
inhibited
MAO
and
ALA
-
T
and
elevated
ALA
levels
.

The
effects
of
PLZ
on
both
amino
acids
and
their
transaminases
were
blocked
by
pre
-
treatment
with
the
MAO
inhibitor
tranylcypromine
.

This
pretreament
had
no
effect
on
the
inhibition
of
GABA
-
T
or
the
elevation
of
brain
GABA
levels
produced
by
VIG
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
At
the
doses
studied
,
PLZ
was
as
effective
as
VIG
at
elevating
brain
GABA
levels
,
but
,
unlike
VIG
,
also
inhibited
MAO
and
ALA
-
T
(
and
increased
brain
ALA
levels
)
.

Pretreatment
of
rats
with
the
MAO
inhibitor
tranylcypromine
prevented
the
increase
in
brain
GABA
and
ALA
levels
with
PLZ
,
but
did
not
block
the
effect
of
VIG
on
GABA
.

These
observations
with
tranylcypromine
and
PLZ
support
the
hypothesis
that
an
active
metabolite
of
PLZ
produced
by
the
actions
of
MAO
on
this
drug
plays
a
major
role
in
its
GABA
-
and
ALA
-
elevating
actions
.

Pharmacology

.

An
estimated
one
-
third
of
the
general
population
is
affected
by
insomnia
,
and
this
number
is
increasing
due
to
more
stressful

Ramelteon
(

)
is
an
orally
active
,
highly
selective
melatonin
MT
(

/
MT
(

)
receptor
agonist
.

Unlike
the
sedative
hypnotics
that
target
GABA

A
)
receptor
complexes
,
ramelteon
is
a
chronohypnotic
that
acts
on
the
melatonin
MT

receptors
,
which
are
primarily
located
in
the

"
As
such
,
ramelteon
possesses
the
first
new

for
a
prescription

medication
in
over
three
decades
.

Ramelteon
has
demonstrated

promoting
effects
in
clinical
trials
,
and
coupled
with
its
favorable
safety

and
lack
of

,
this
chronohypnotic
provides
an
important
treatment
option
for

Clinical
utility
of
acarbose
,
an
alpha
-
glucosidase
inhibitor
in
cardiometabolic
disorders
.

Diabetes
is
associated
with
an
increase
risk
for
cardiovascular
disease
(
CVD
)
.

Recently
,
macrovascular
complications
of
diabetes
have
been
shown
to
start
before
the
development
of
diabetes
.

Indeed
,
several
clinical
studies
have
confirmed
the
increased
risk
of
CVD
in
patients
with
impaired
glucose
tolerance
(
IGT
)
.

Since
postprandial
hyperglycemia
and
insulin
resistance
are
thought
to
play
a
central
role
in
the
development
and
progression
of
CVD
in
patients
with
IGT
,
amelioration
of
postprandial
hyperglycemia
as
well
as
insulin
resistance
is
a
therapeutic
target
for
the
prevention
of
CVD
in
these
high
-
risk
patients
.

Acarbose
,
an
alpha
-
glucosidase
inhibitor
,
delays
the
absorption
of
carbohydrate
from
the
small
intestine
,
thereby
reducing
postprandial
hyperglycemia
.

Further
,
recently
,
acarbose
has
been
shown
to
improve
insulin
resistance
in
vivo
.

These
findings
suggest
that
acarbose
is
a
promising
metabolic
modifier
that
could
reduce
the
risk
of
CVD
in
patients
with
the
metabolic
syndrome
.

In
this
paper
,
we
review
the
clinical
utility
of
acarbose
in
various
cardiometabolic
disorders
.

Tolvaptan
and
its
potential
in
the
treatment
of
hyponatremia
.

Tolvaptan
is
a
selective
arginine
vasopressin
(
AVP
)
V
(
2
)
receptor
blocker
used
to
induce
free
water
diuresis
in
the
treatment
of
euvolemic
or
hypervolemic
hyponatremia
.

Currently
the
orally
active
medication
is
in
the
final
stages
prior
to
approval
by
the
FDA
for
outpatient
therapy
.

It
appears
to
be
safe
and
effective
at
promoting
aquaresis
and
raising
serum
sodium
levels
in
both
short
-
and
long
-
term
studies
.

Tolvaptan
is
also
effective
for
treatment
of
congestive
heart
failure
(
CHF
)
exacerbation
,
but
whether
there
are
long
standing
beneficial
effects
on
CHF
is
still
controversial
.

Prolonged
use
of
tolvaptan
leads
to
increased
endogenous
levels
of
AVP
and
perhaps
over
-
stimulation
of
V
(
1A
)
receptors
.

Theoretically
this
activation
could
lead
to
increased
afterload
and
cardiac
myocyte
fibrosis
,
causing
progression
of
CHF
.

However
,
after
52
weeks
of
tolvaptan
therapy
there
was
no
worsening
of
left
ventricular
dilatation
.

In
addition
,
tolvaptan
is
metabolized
by
the
CYP3A4
system
;
thus
physicians
should
be
aware
of
the
potential
for
increased
interactions
with
other
medications
.

Tolvaptan
is
a
breakthrough
in
the
therapy
of
hyponatremia
as
it
directly
combats
elevated
AVP
levels
associated
with
the
syndrome
of
inappropriate
secretion
of
antidiuretic
hormone
,
congestive
heart
failure
,
and
cirrhosis
of
the
liver
.

Rivastigmine
for
Alzheimer
'
s
disease
.

BACKGROUND
:
Alzheimer
'
s
disease
(
AD
)
is
the
commonest
cause
of
dementia
affecting
older
people
.

One
of
the
therapeutic
strategies
aimed
at
ameliorating
the
clinical
manifestations
of
Alzheimer
'
s
disease
is
to
enhance
cholinergic
neurotransmission
in
relevant
parts
of
the
brain
by
the
use
of
cholinesterase
inhibitors
to
delay
the
breakdown
of
acetylcholine
released
into
synaptic
clefts
.

Tacrine
,
the
first
of
the
cholinesterase
inhibitors
to
undergo
extensive
trials
for
this
purpose
,
was
associated
with
significant
adverse
effects
including
hepatotoxicity
.

Other
cholinesterase
inhibitors
,
including
rivastigmine
,
with
superior
properties
in
terms
of
specificity
of
action
and
low
risk
of
adverse
effects
,
have
now
been
introduced
.

Rivastigmine
has

in
which
treatment
with
rivastigmine
was
administered
to
patients
with
dementia
of
the

s
type
for
more
than
two
weeks
and
its
effects
compared
with
those
of

in
a
parallel
group
of
patients
.

DATA
COLLECTION
AND
ANALYSIS
:
One
reviewer
(
JSB
)
applied
study
selection
criteria
,
assessed
the
quality
of
studies
and
extracted
data
.

MAIN
RESULTS
:
Nine
trials
,
involving
4775
participants
,
were
included
in
the
analyses
.

Use
of
rivastigmine
in
high
doses
was
associated
with
statistically
significant
benefits
on
several
measures
.

High
-
dose
rivastigmine
(
6
to
12
mg
daily
)
was
associated
with
a
two
-
point
improvement
in
cognitive
function
on
the
ADAS
-
Cog
score
compared
with
placebo
(
weighted
mean
difference
-

,
95
%
confidence
interval
-
2
.
49
to
-
1
.
50
,
on
an
intention
-
to
-
treat
basis
)
and
a
2
.
2
point
improvement
in
activities
of
daily
living
assessed
on
the
Progressive
Deterioration
Scale
(
weighted
mean
difference
-
2
.
15
,
95
%
confidence
interval
-
3
.
16
to
-
1
.
13
,
on
an
intention
-
to
-
treat
basis
)
at
26
weeks
.

At
lower
doses
(
4
mg
daily
or
lower
)
differences
were
in
the
same
direction
but
were
statistically
significant
only
for
cognitive
function
.

There
were
statistically
significantly
higher
numbers
of
events
of
nausea
,
vomiting
,
diarrhoea
,
anorexia
,
headache
,
syncope
,
abdominal
pain
and
dizziness
among
patients
taking
high
-
dose
rivastigmine
than
among
those
taking
placebo
.

There
was
some
evidence
that
adverse
events
might
be
less
common
with
more
frequent
,
smaller
doses
of
rivastigmine
.

The
2008
update
includes
a
new
study
testing
two
types
of
rivastigmine
transdermal
patch
,
one
delivering
a
higher
dose
than
previously
tested
(
17
.
4
mg
/
day
)
and
a
smaller
patch
delivering
9
.
6
mg
/
day
.

The
efficacy
of
the
smaller
patch
was
not
significantly
different
compared
with
the
capsules
of
similar
daily
dose
,
but
was
associated
with
significantly
fewer
adverse
events
of
nausea
,
vomiting
,
dizziness
and
asthenia
.

The
efficacy
of
the
larger
patch
was
not
significantly
different
compared
with
the
smaller
patch
,
but
the
smaller
patch
was
associated
with
significantly
fewer
adverse
events
of
nausea
,
vomiting
,
weight
loss
and
dizziness
.

There
appears
to
be
advantages
associated
with
the
smaller
patch
compared
with
both
the
higher
dose
patch
and
the
6
-
12
mg
/
day
capsules
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
Rivastigmine
appears
to
be
beneficial
for
people
with
mild
to
moderate
Alzheimer
'
s
disease
.

In
comparisons
with
placebo
,
improvements
were
seen
in
the
rate
of
decline
of
cognitive
function
,
activities
of
daily
living
,
and
severity
of
dementia
with
daily
doses
of
6
to
12
mg
.

Adverse
events
were
consistent
with
the
cholinergic
actions
of
the
drug
.

A
transdermal
patch
has
been
tested
in
one
trial
,
and
there
is
evidence
that
the
lower
dose
smaller
patch
is
associated
with
fewer
side
effects
than
the
capsules
or
the
higher
dose
larger
patch
and
has
comparable
efficacy
to
both
.

review
has

Effect
of
ketoconazole
on
the
pharmacokinetic
profile
of
ambrisentan
.

Ambrisentan
is
an
endothelin
type
A
(
ET
(
A
)
)
-
selective
receptor
antagonist
that
is
metabolized
primarily
by
glucuronidation
but
also
undergoes
oxidative
metabolism
by
CYP3A4
.

The
potential
for
ketoconazole
,
the
archetypal
strong
inhibitor
of
CYP3A4
,
to
alter
the
pharmacokinetic
profile
of
ambrisentan
and
its
oxidative
metabolite
,
4
-
hydroxymethyl
ambrisentan
,
was
assessed
in
an
open
-
label
,
nonrandomized
,
2
-
period
,
single
-
sequence
study
in
16
healthy
men
.

Participants
received
a
single
dose
of
ambrisentan
10
mg
alone
and
after
4
days
of
ketoconazole
400
mg
administered
once
daily
.

In
the
presence
of
multiple
doses
of
ketoconazole
,
single
-
dose
ambrisentan
AUC
(
0
-
infinity
)
estimate
was
increased
by
35
.
3
%
,
whereas
C
(
max
)
was
increased
by
20
.
0
%
.

For
the
4
-
hydroxymethyl
ambrisentan
metabolite
,
AUC
(
0
-
infinity
)
estimate
was
decreased
by
4
.
0
%
,
whereas
C
(
max
)
was
decreased
by
16
.
5
%
.

Concomitant
administration
of
ambrisentan
and
ketoconazole
was
well
tolerated
.

In
summary
,
ketoconazole
had
no
clinically
significant
effect
on
the
pharmacokinetics
or
safety
profile
of
ambrisentan
;
therefore
,
no
changes
in
ambrisentan
dose
should
be
necessary
when
the
drug
is
administered
concomitantly
with
known
CYP3A4
inhibitors
.

ATP
-
binding
cassette
transporter
A1
is
involved
in
hepatic
alpha
-
tocopherol
secretion
.

Vitamin
E
(
alpha
-
tocopherol
)
is
an
essential
fat
-
soluble
nutrient
with
antioxidant
properties
.

alpha
-
Tocopherol
transfer
protein
(
alpha
-
TTP
)
,
the
product
of
the
gene
responsible
for
familial
isolated
vitamin
E
deficiency
,
plays
an
important
role
in
maintaining
the
plasma
alpha
-
tocopherol
level
by
mediating
the
secretion
of
alpha
-
tocopherol
by
the
liver
.

However
,
the
mechanisms
underlying
hepatic
alpha
-
tocopherol
secretion
are
not
fully
understood
.

This
study
was
undertaken
to
elucidate
the
mechanism
of
alpha
-
tocopherol
re
-
efflux
from
hepatocytes
,
the
cells
that
have
the
most
important
role
in
regulating
plasma
-
alpha
-
tocopherol
concentrations
.

From
in
vitro
experiments
using
[
(
3
)
H
]
alpha
-
tocopheryl
acetate
and
McARH7777
cells
that
stably
express
alpha
-
tocopherol
transfer
protein
(
alpha
-
TTP
)
,
the
following
results
were
obtained
.

First
,
addition
of
apolipoprotein
A
-
I
(
apoA
-
I
)
,
a
direct
acceptor
of
the
ATP
-
binding
cassette
transporter
A1
(
ABCA1
)
-
secreted
lipids
,
increased
alpha
-
tocopherol
secretion
in
a
dose
-
dependent
manner
.

Second
,
probucol
,
an
antiatherogenic
compound
reported
to
be
an
inactivator
of
ABCA1
reduced
hepatic
alpha
-
tocopherol
secretion
.

Third
,
ABCA1
-
RNAi
suppressed
hepatic
alpha
-
tocopherol
secretion
.

In
a
mouse
in
vivo
experiment
,
addition
of
1
%
probucol
to
the
diet
decreased
plasma
alpha
-
tocopherol
concentrations
.

These
results
strongly
suggest
that
ABCA1
is
substantially
involved
in
hepatic
alpha
-
tocopherol
secretion
.

AMP
-
activated
protein
kinase
-
dependent
and
-
independent
mechanisms
underlying
in
vitro
antiglioma
action
of
compound
C
.

We
investigated
the
effect
of
compound
C
,
a
well
-
known
inhibitor
of
the
intracellular
energy
sensor
AMP
-
activated
protein
kinase
(
AMPK
)
,
on
proliferation
and
viability
of
human
U251
and
rat
C6
glioma
cell
lines
.

Compound
C
caused
G
(
2
)
/
M
cell
cycle
block
,
accompanied
by
apoptotic
glioma
cell
death
characterized
by
caspase
activation
,
phosphatidylserine
exposure
and
DNA
fragmentation
.

The
mechanisms
underlying
the
pro
-
apoptotic
action
of
compound
C
involved
induction
of
oxidative
stress
and
downregulation
of
antiapoptotic
molecule
Bcl
-
2
,
while
no
alteration
of
pro
-
apoptotic
Bax
was
observed
.

Compound
C
diminished
AMPK
phosphorylation
and
enzymatic
activity
,
resulting
in
reduced
phosphorylation
of
its
target
acetyl
CoA
carboxylase
.

AMPK
activators
metformin
and
AICAR
partly
prevented
the
cell
cycle
block
,
oxidative
stress
and
apoptosis
induced
by
compound
C
.

The
small
interfering
RNA
(
siRNA
)
targeting
of
human
AMPK
mimicked
compound
C
-
induced
G
(
2
)
/
M
cell
cycle
arrest
,
but
failed
to
induce
oxidative
stress
and
apoptosis
in
U251
glioma
cells
.

In
conclusion
,
our
data
indicate
that
AMPK
inhibition
is
required
,
but
not
sufficient
for
compound
C
-
mediated
apoptotic
death
of
glioma
cells
.

Inhibitory
effect
of
selective
serotonin
reuptake
inhibitors
on
the
vesicular
monoamine
transporter
2
.

The
neuronal
vesicular
monoamine
transporter
(
VMAT2
)
is
the
target
molecule
of
action
of
some
psychostimulants
,
such
as
methamphetamine
and
3
,
4
-
methylenedioxymethamphetamine
(
MDMA
)
.

The
present
study
examined
the
effect
of
antidepressants
,
such
as
selective
serotonin
reuptake
inhibitors
(
SSRIs
)
,
on
VMAT2
activity
by
measuring
adenosine
triphosphate
-
dependent
[
(
3
)
H
]
dopamine
uptake
into
synaptic
vesicles
prepared
from
rat
striatum
.

SSRIs
,
fluoxetine
,
paroxetine
,
and
fluvoxamine
,
inhibited
vesicular
[
(
3
)
H
]
dopamine
uptake
in
vitro
.

The
rank
order
of
potency
was
reserpine
>
>
fluoxetine
,
paroxetine
>
fluvoxamine
,
methamphetamine
>
MDMA
.

Moreover
,
kinetic
analysis
revealed
that
inhibition
by
reserpine
,
a
typical
VMAT2
inhibitor
,
was
uncompetitive
,
decreasing
maximum
velocity
and
affinity
for
dopamine
.

Inhibition
by
fluoxetine
was
noncompetitive
,
only
decreasing
maximum
velocity
for
dopamine
.

These
results
suggest
that
fluoxetine
inhibited
the
activity
of
VMAT2
by
a
mechanism
different
from
that
of
reserpine
and
did
not
directly
interact
with
the
active
site
of
VMAT2
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
Myocardial
deformation
is
impaired
in
RA
patients
and
is
related
to
nitro
-
oxidative
stress
and
endothelial
dysfunction
.

Chronic

and
nitro

.

Amitriptyline
is
a
TrkA
and
TrkB
receptor
agonist
that
promotes
TrkA
/
TrkB
heterodimerization
and
has
potent
neurotrophic
activity
.

Neurotrophins
,
the
cognate
ligands
for
the
Trk
receptors
,
are
homodimers
and
induce
Trk
dimerization
through
a
symmetric
bivalent
mechanism
.

We
report
here
that
amitriptyline
,
an
antidepressant
drug
,
directly
binds
TrkA
and
TrkB
and
triggers
their
dimerization
and
activation
.

Amitriptyline
,
but
not
any
other
tricyclic
or
selective
serotonin
reuptake
inhibitor
antidepressants
,
promotes
TrkA
autophosphorylation
in
primary
neurons
and
induces
neurite
outgrowth
in
PC12
cells
.

Amitriptyline
binds
the
extracellular
domain
of
both
TrkA
and
TrkB
and
promotes
TrkA
-
TrkB
receptor
heterodimerization
.

Truncation
of
amitriptyline
binding
motif
on
TrkA
abrogates
the
receptor
dimerization
by
amitriptyline
.

Administration
of
amitriptyline
to
mice
activates
both
receptors
and
significantly
reduces
kainic
acid
-
triggered
neuronal
cell
death
.

Inhibition
of
TrkA
,
but
not
TrkB
,
abolishes
amitriptyline
'
s
neuroprotective
effect
without
impairing
its
antidepressant
activity
.

Thus
,
amitriptyline
acts
as
a
TrkA
and
TrkB
agonist
and
possesses
marked
neurotrophic
activity
.

Effects
of

inhibitors
acarbose
and
voglibose
on

Cellular
mechanisms
of
insulin
resistance
:
role
of
stress
-
regulated
serine
kinases
and
insulin
receptor
substrates
(
IRS
)
serine
phosphorylation
.

Insulin
receptor
substrates
(
IRS
)
serine
phosphorylation
is
a
time
-
controlled
physiological
feedback
mechanism
in
insulin
signaling
that
is
hijacked
by
metabolic
and
inflammatory
stresses
to
promote
insulin
resistance
.

Kinases
,
including
IKKbeta
,
JNK
,
ERK
,
mTOR
,
and
S6K
,
activated
by
the
inducers
of
insulin
resistance
induce
uncontrolled
IRS
serine
phosphorylation
.

Studies
with
genetically
modified
mice
reveal
that
these
kinases
integrate
signals
from
metabolic
and
inflammatory
stresses
in
adipose
tissue
,
liver
,
and
hypothalamus
leading
to
peripheral
and
central
insulin
resistance
.

Moreover
,
IKKbeta
/
NF
-
kappaB
and
JNK1
pathways
in
myeloid
cells
represent
a
core
mechanism
involved
in
inflammation
linked
to
obesity
.

These
kinases
are
thus
potential
drug
targets
against
insulin
resistance
and
the
targeting
of
the
IKKbeta
/
NF
-
kappaB
or
the
JNK
pathway
may
evolve
into
future
diabetes
medication
.

Vapreotide
:
a
somatostatin
analog
for
the
treatment
of
acute
variceal
bleeding
.

BACKGROUND
:
Portal
hypertension
is
a
clinically
important
consequence
of
cirrhosis
that
can
lead
to
morbidities
such
as
variceal
bleeding
,
hepatic
encephalopathy
and
ascites
.

All
of
these
outcomes
carry
high
mortality
rates
.

There
have
been
several
drugs
created
to
assist
with
endoscopic
therapy
for
the
treatment
of
acute
variceal
bleeding
.

Recently
,
vapreotide
has
been
studied
in
patients
to
evaluate
its
efficacy
as
treatment
for
acute
variceal
hemorrhage
.

Although
no
comparisons
have
been
made
between
vapreotide
and
other
somatostatin
analogues
,
this
drug
has
been
shown
to
have
efficacy
in
the
control
of
acute
variceal
bleeding
as
well
as
reducing
the
risk
of
recurrent
bleeding
and
death
,
especially
when
started
prior
to
endoscopy
.

OBJECTIVE
:
This
paper
reviews
the
literature
regarding
the
basic
science
and
clinical
efficacy
of
vapreotide
in
acute
variceal
bleeding
.

METHODS
:
We
used
a
PubMed
/
Medline
search
in
order
to
review
the
literature
regarding
the
drug
,
vapreotide
.

RESULTS
/
CONCLUSIONS
:
Vapreotide
appears
to
have
benefit
in
the
control
of
acute
variceal
bleeding
.

It
is
easy
to
administer
and
has
few
side
effects
,
which
are
minor
.

These
findings
endorse
the
need
for
future
trials
to
evaluate
vapreotide
and
its
use
in
acute
variceal
hemorrhage
,
a
morbidity
among
patients
with
cirrhosis
.

Esmolol
reduces
autonomic
hypersensitivity
and
length
of
seizures
induced
by
electroconvulsive
therapy
.

We
evaluated
the
clinical
effectiveness
of
esmolol
,
an
ultra
-
short
-
acting
beta
1
-
adrenergic
receptor
blocking
drug
,
to
control
the
sinus
tachycardia
and
increase
in
arterial
blood
pressures
induced
by
electroconvulsive
therapy
(
ECT
)
.

Each
of
20
patients
,
ASA
physical
status
I
-
III
,
participated
in
a
double
-
blind
,
randomized
study
,
involving
four
match
-
pair
trials
(
placebo
versus
esmolol
)
during
ECT
.

Each
patient
acted
as
his
or
her
own
control
(
total
number
of
ECT
procedures
,
160
)
.

We
administered
a
4
-
min
infusion
of
either
placebo
or
esmolol
at
the
rate
of
500
micrograms
.
kg
-
1
.
min
-
1
.

We
then
induced
anesthesia
with
methohexital
and
succinylcholine
.

After
administration
of
electrical
stimulation
for
ECT
,
the
rate
of
infusion
decreased
to
300
micrograms
.
kg
-
1
.
min
-
1
for
three
additional
minutes
and
was
then
discontinued
.

Statistically
significant
reductions
in
mean
heart
rate
from
minute
2
until
minute
15
and
in
maximum
heart
rate
(
the
mean
of
each
patient
'
s
maximum
heart
rate
after
seizure
changed
from
152
+
/
-
23
to
115
+
/
-
24
beats
/
min
)
occurred
in
patients
given
esmolol
.

During
and
immediately
after
infusion
,
arterial
blood
pressure
also
decreased
.

Finally
,
the
length
of
seizures
decreased
,
as
manifested
clinically
from
48
+
/
-
18
to
39
+
/
-
14
s
and
on
electroencephalogram
from
86
+
/
-
41
to
67
+
/
-
28
s
.

We
conclude
that
esmolol
effectively
controls
the
hyperdynamic
response
to
ECT
and
reduces
the
length
of
seizures
.

The
significance
of
the
latter
to
the
overall
effectiveness
of
ECT
is
not
known
.

Histamine
and
asthma
:
an
appraisal
based
on
specific
H1
-
receptor
antagonism
.

H1
-
receptor
antagonists
have
been
utilized
,
following
their
initial
chemical
synthesis
in
1933
,
both
in
the
treatment
of
conditions
in
which
histamine
is
considered
to
be
of
pathogenic
importance
and
conversely
to
help
elucidate
the
role
of
histamine
in
disease
,
through
an
evaluation
of
their
influence
on
disease
expression
.

While
there
is
considerable
indirect
evidence
to
implicate
histamine
in
the
pathogenesis
of
asthma
,
a
critical
evaluation
of
H1
-
receptor
antagonism
in
this
condition
has
,
until
recently
,
proved
difficult
,
as
many
of
the
early
H1
-
receptor
antagonists
possessed
additional
actions
,
such
as
anti
-
cholinergic
,
local
anaesthetic
,
alpha
-
adrenoceptor
antagonistic
and
anti
-
serotonin
activity
.

In
addition
,
H1
-
receptor
antagonists
have
been
shown
to
have
effects
on
mast
cell
function
.

In
low
concentrations
in
vitro
,
antihistamines
have
been
found
to
inhibit
immunologically
stimulated
mast
cell
mediator
release
,
with
the
IC50
in
the
nanomolar
to
micromolar
range
,
while
at
higher
concentrations
they
induce
histamine
release
.

The
potency
of
these
drugs
in
producing
such
effects
is
unrelated
to
their
H1
-
receptor
blocking
activity
.

Furthermore
the
sedative
effects
of
these
therapeutic
agents
limit
the
tolerable
administrable
dose
and
thus
the
degree
of
H1
-
receptor
blockade
achievable
within
the
airways
.

The
recent
development
of
H1
-
receptor
antagonists
devoid
of
clinical
sedative
effects
has
enabled
the
administration
of
doses
of
H1
-
antihistamines
which
achieve
a
greater
degree
of
H1
-
receptor
blockade
within
the
airways
,
thus
permitting
a
better
appraisal
of
the
role
of
histamine
in
this
condition
.

Furthermore
,
the
receptor
specificity
of
many
of
these
agents
has
been
focused
such
that
terfenadine
,
astemizole
,
loratadine
and
cetirizine
are
devoid
of
anticholinergic
activity
and
exhibit
little
alpha
-
antagonistic
or
anti
-
serotonin
activity
of
clinical
relevance
.

However
,
of
these
agents
both
loratadine
and
cetirizine
possess
additional
actions
likely
to
be
of
relevance
to
asthma
.

Pretreatment
with
loratadine
has
been
shown
to
reduce
the
recovery
of
both
histamine
and
prostaglandin
D2
(
PGD2
)
in
nasal
lavage
fluid
following
nasal
allergen
challenge
,
a
finding
interpreted
as
indicative
of
in
vivo
mast
cell
stabilization
,
and
cetirizine
has
been
shown
in
vivo
at
therapeutic
doses
to
inhibit
allergen
-
induced
eosinophil
chemotaxis
.

Thus
while
both
these
agents
offer
the
potential
of
an
oral
therapy
for
asthma
based
on
an
H1
-
receptor
antagonist
,
their
additional
actions
do
not
make
them
ideally
suited
to
the
exploration
of
the
role
of
histamine
in
asthma
.

ABSTRACT
TRUNCATED
AT
400
WORDS
)

The
potassium
channel
subunit
Kvbeta3
interacts
with
pannexin
1
and
attenuates
its
sensitivity
to
changes
in
redox
potentials
.

Pannexin
1
(
Panx1
)
,
a
member
of
the
second
gap
junction
protein
family
identified
in
vertebrates
,
appears
to
preferentially
form
non
-
junctional
membrane
channels
.

A
candidate
regulatory
protein
of
Panx1
is
the
potassium
channel
subunit
Kvbeta3
,
previously
identified
by
bacterial
two
-
hybrid
strategies
.

Here
,
we
report
on
the
physical
association
of
Panx1
with
Kvbeta3
by
immunoprecipitation
when
co
-
expressed
in
a
neuroblastoma
cell
line
(
Neuro2A
)
.

Furthermore
,
in
vivo
co
-
expression
of
Panx1
and
Kvbeta3
was
shown
to
occur
in
murine
hippocampus
and
cerebellum
.

Kvbeta3
is
known
to
accelerate
inactivation
of
otherwise
slowly
inactivating
potassium
channels
under
reducing
conditions
.

We
subsequently
found
that
Panx1
channel
currents
exhibit
a
significant
reduction
when
exposed
to
reducing
agents
,
and
that
this
effect
is
attenuated
in
the
presence
of
Kvbeta3
.

Apparently
,
Kvbeta3
is
involved
in
regulating
the
susceptibility
of
Panx1
channels
to
redox
potential
.

Furthermore
,
the
Panx1
channel
blockers
carbenoxolone
and
Probenecid
were
less
effective
in
inhibiting
Panx1
currents
when
Kvbeta3
was
co
-
expressed
.

The
influence
of
Kvbeta3
on
Panx1
is
the
first
example
of
modulation
of
Panx1
channel
function
(
s
)
by
interacting
proteins
,
and
suggests
the
physiological
importance
of
sensing
changes
in
redox
potentials
.

Screening
for
(
anti
)
androgenic
properties
using
a
standard
operation
protocol
based
on
the
human
stably
transfected
androgen
sensitive
PALM
cell
line
.

First
steps
towards
validation
.

Despite
more
than
a
decade
of
research
in
the
field
of
endocrine
active
compounds
targeting
the
androgen
receptor
(
AR
)
,
and
although
suitable
cell
lines
can
be
obtained
,
no
validated
human
stably
transfected
androgen
sensitive
transactivation
assay
is
available
.

Bayer
Schering
Pharma
(
BSP
)
and
the
Flemish
Institute
for
Technological
Research
(
VITO
)
,
partners
within
the
EU
-
sponsored
6th
framework
project
ReProTect
,
made
first
steps
towards
such
a
validation
.

A
standard
operation
protocol
(
SOP
)
developed
at
BSP
based
on
the
androgen
sensitive
PALM
cell
line
was
transferred
to
VITO
and
its
performance
and
transferability
were
thoroughly
studied
.

The
investigation
followed
a
generic
protocol
prepared
for
all
reporter
gene
assays
evaluated
within
ReProTect
,
and
in
both
laboratories
at
least
three
independent
experiments
were
performed
.

The
highest
concentration
to
be
tested
was
limited
to
10
microM
,
if
needed
.

A
few
compounds
,
17alpha
-
methyltestosterone
(
17alpha
-
MT
)
,
vinclozolin
and
linuron
,
were
studied
using
a
real
world
scenario
,
i
.
e
.
,
assuming
that
their
interaction
with
the
AR
was
not
known
:
A
prescreening
for
agonism
and
true
,
competitive
antagonism
was
used
to
select
conditions
such
as
the
appropriate
mode
of
action
,
and
the
working
range
excluding
cytotoxicity
for
the
final
screening
.

All
other
compounds
were
tested
according
to
the
generic
protocol
:
Compounds
screened
for
agonism
were
the
reference
androgen
17alpha
-
methyldihydrotestosterone
(
MDHT
)
,
levonorgestrel
,
norethynodrel
,
progesterone
,
o
,
p
'
-
DDT
,
and
dibutylphthalate
(
DBP
)
,
while
compounds
screened
for
antagonism
were
the
reference
anti
-
androgen
flutamide
,
prochloraz
,
o
,
p
'
-
DDT
,
progesterone
,
norethynodrel
,
and
DBP
.

Cytotoxicity
was
assessed
in
parallel
as
lactate
dehydrogenase
release
.

The
prescreen
classified
17alpha
-
MT
as
androgenic
,
vinclozolin
and
linuron
as
anti
-
androgenic
and
compounds
were
tested
accordingly
.

In
the
absence
of
cytotoxicity
,
appropriate
androgenic
properties
of
reference
and
test
compounds
were
detected
by
both
laboratories
,
o
,
p
'
-
DDT
and
DBP
had
no
androgenic
activity
.

Across
the
two
laboratories
EC
(
50
)
-
values
for
MDHT
,
17alpha
-
MT
,
and
levonorgestrel
varied
by
not
more
than
a
factor
of
3
.
4
,
for
norethynodrel
by
a
factor
of
9
.
7
.

Progesterone
effects
could
not
fully
be
evaluated
,
as
frequently
concentration
response
curves
were
incomplete
.

In
the
absence
of
cytotoxicity
anti
-
androgenic
properties
of
reference
and
test
compounds
were
also
detected
in
both
laboratories
.

DBP
,
the
putative
negative
reference
compound
,
was
inactive
,
norethynodrel
rather
showed
agonistic
properties
.

Progesterone
was
an
antagonist
at
low
concentrations
,
but
agonistic
properties
were
observed
in
one
laboratory
at
high
concentrations
.

Since
the
highest
test
concentration
was
limited
to
10
microM
,
for
some
compounds
no
complete
concentration
response
curves
were
obtained
and
estimation
of
EC
(
50
)
-
values
was
less
robust
.

Our
data
demonstrated
that
the
SOP
was
transferable
,
and
that
the
assay
was
able
to
rank
compounds
with
strong
,
weak
,
and
without
affinity
for
the
AR
and
to
discriminate
agonists
and
antagonists
.

The
sensitivity
of
the
assay
could
be
improved
further
,
if
the
limit
of
solubility
or
beginning
cytotoxicity
was
chosen
as
the
highest
test
concentration
.

The
assay
avoids
the
use
of
tissues
from
laboratory
animals
,
and
thus
contributes
to
the
3R
concept
.

Furthermore
,
it
could
be
adjusted
to
an
intermediate
/
high
throughput
format
.

On
the
whole
,
this
PALM
assay
is
a
promising
candidate
for
further
validation
.

Binding
between
heparin
and
the
integrin
VLA
-
4
.

Heparin
possesses
antimetastatic
effects
that
were
related
to
various
molecular
mechanisms
beyond
anticoagulant
activities
.

The
ability
of
heparin
to
interfere
with
the
function
of
adhesion
receptors
in
the
metastatic
course
appears
as
a
promising
therapeutic
approach
.

This
refers
to
numerous
findings
that
heparin
attenuates
metastasis
in
a
selectin
-
dependent
manner
.

We
recently
demonstrated
that
heparin
interferes
with
the
integrin
VLA
-
4
on
murine
melanoma
cells
binding
to
VCAM
-
1
.

To
confirm
this
activity
and
to
obtain
further
insight
into
molecular
recognition
of
heparin
by
VLA
-
4
,
we
investigated
the
inhibition
of
VLA
-
4
mediated
binding
of
human
melanoma
MV3
cells
to
immobilised
VCAM
-
1
by
different
heparins
.

The
size
of
heparin
has
an
important
impact
on
inhibition
.

Unfractionated
heparin
(
UFH
)
and
tinzaparin
,
a
low

molecular
-
weight
heparin
(
LMWH
)
representing
a
mean
of
about
18
-
20
monomers
,
displayed
high
inhibitory
activity
.

Fractionating
tinzaparin
to
14
-
18
monomers
reduced
inhibition
slightly
,
while
the
pentasaccharide
fondaparinux
was
without
effects
.

To
confirm
molecular
recognition
of
tinzaparin
by
VLA
-
4
,
a
surface
acoustic
wave
-
biosensor
was
applied
.

A
VLA
-
4
containing
membrane
preparation
of
MV3
cells
was
immobilised
at
the
sensors
to
allow
for
detection
of
kinetic
binding
constants
of
tinzaparin
compared
to
VCAM
-

.

Tinzaparin
binds
to
VLA

in
the
low
micromolar
range
(

)
,
which
clearly
indicates
specific
molecular
recognition
.

Furthermore
,
tinzaparin
displays
a
nearly

compared
to
VCAM

Effects
of
bambuterol
and
terbutaline
on
isolated
rat
'
s
tracheal
smooth
muscle
.

Terbutaline
(
Bricanyl
)
and
its
prodrug
Bambuterol
(
Bambec
)
are
highly
potent
beta
(
2
)
-
adrenoceptor
agonists
often
used
in
asthma
patients
.

Terbutaline
in
the
form
of
inhaled
short
-
acting
bronchodilator
relieves
asthmatic
symptoms
.

However
,
the
effects
of
bambuterol
given
intratracheally
have
rarely
been
explored
.

To
verify
the
effect
of
bambuterol
and
terbutaline
,
which
act
on
the
tracheal
smooth
muscle
directly
in
vitro
,
we
used
our
preparation
to
test
the
effects
of
bambuterol
on
isolated
rat
'
s
tracheal
smooth
muscle
compared
with
terbutaline
.

The
following
assessments
of
bambuterol
and
terbutaline
were
performed
:
(

)
effect
on
tracheal
smooth
muscle
resting
tension
;
(

)
effect
on
contraction
caused
by

M
methacholine
as
a
parasympathetic
mimetic
;
(
3
)
effect
of
the
drugs
on
electrically
induced
tracheal
smooth
muscle
contractions
.

The
results
indicated
that
adding
bambuterol
induced
a
significant
further
contraction
to
10
(
-
6
)
M
methacholine
-
induced
contraction
when
the
preparation
was
increased
to
10
(
-

)
M
.

But
terbutaline
elicited
a
relaxation
response
at
a
dose
of
10
(
-
6
)
M
or
more
.

Both
bambuterol
and
terbutaline
could
inhibit
electrical
field
stimulation
(
EFS
)
induced
spike
contraction
.

Terbutaline
had
an
anti
-
cholinergic
effect
that
could
relieve
asthmatic
symptoms
.

But
the
effect
of
bambuterol
acting
on
tracheal
smooth
muscle
directly
was
controversial
.

Polymorphisms
in
dopamine
transporter
(
SLC6A3
)
are
associated
with
stimulant
effects
of
D

amphetamine
:
an
exploratory
pharmacogenetic
study
using
healthy
volunteers
.

Individuals
vary
in
their
subjective
responses
to
stimulant
drugs
,
and
these
differences
are
believed
to
be
partially
genetic
in
origin
.

We
evaluated
associations
between
mood
,
cognitive
and
cardiovascular
responses
to
d

amphetamine
and
four
polymorphisms
in
the
dopamine
transporter
(

,
rs3756450
,
rs37022
and
rs6869645
.

Healthy
Caucasian
male
and
female
volunteers
(
N

)
participated
in
a
double

blind
,
crossover
design
study
in
which
they
received
placebo
,
10
and
20
mg
of
d

.

We
measured
self

reported
rating
of
mood
,
performance
on
the
Digit

Substitution
Task
,
blood
pressure
and
heart
rate
.

Individuals
with
the
C

C
genotype
at
rs460000
(
N
=
83
)
reported
approximately
twofold
higher
ratings
of
stimulation
and
euphoria
relative
to
the
A

A
/
C
(
N

)
genotype
group
,
at
both
the
10
and
20
mg
doses
.

No
other
responses
or
SNPs
showed
significant
effects
.

rs460000
is
in
perfect
LD
with
rs463379
(
CEU

,
which
was
not
studied
here
,
but
has
been
associated
with
etiology
of
Attention
Deficit
Hyperactivity
Disorder
(
ADHD
)
.

These
findings
suggest
a
pleiotropic
effect
of
this

on
both

to
the

Bile
acids
induce
cdx2
expression
through
the
farnesoid
x
receptor
in
gastric
epithelial
cells
.

Clinical
and
experimental
studies
showed
that
the
reflux
of
bile
into
the
stomach
contributes
to
the
induction
of
intestinal
metaplasia
of
the
stomach
and
gastric
carcinogenesis
.

Caudal

a
key
role
in
the

regulating
the
expression
of
intestine
-
specific
genes
such
as
goblet

gene
mucin
2
(
MUC2
)
.

We
investigated
the
involvement
of
the
farnesoid
X
receptor
(
FXR
)
,
a
nuclear
receptor
for
bile
acids
,
in
the
chenodeoxycholic
acid
(
CDCA
)
-
induced
expression
of
Cdx2
and
MUC2
in
normal
rat
gastric
epithelial

(
RGM
-

cells
)
.

RGM
-

cells
were
treated
with
CDCA
or
GW4064
,
an
FXR
agonist
,
in
the
presence
or
absence
of
guggulsterone
,
an
FXR
antagonist
.

CDCA
induced
dose
-
dependent
expression
of
Cdx2
and
MUC2
at
both
the
mRNA
and
protein
levels
.

The
maximum
stimulation
of
Cdx2
and
MUC2
mRNA
induced
by
CDCA
was
observed
at
3
h
and
by
6
h
,
respectively
.

GW4064
also
induced
expression
of
these
molecules
.

The
effects
of
CDCA
and
GW4064
on
expression
of
Cdx2
and
MUC2
were
abolished
by
guggulsterone
.

These
findings
suggest
that
bile
acids
may
induce
gastric
intestinal
metaplasia
and
carcinogenesis
through
the
FXR
.

and
the
different

showed
very

.

Phenols
like
the
ones
investigated
here
possess
a
CA

mechanism
distinct
of
that
of
the
sulfonamides

sulfamates
used

Unlike
the
sulfonamides
,
which
bind
to
the
catalytic
zinc
ion
,
phenols
are
anchored
at
the
Zn

coordinated
water
molecule
and
bind
more
externally
within
the
active

,
making

As
this
is
the
region
with
the
highest
variability
between
the
many
CA

found
in
mammals
,
this
class
of

Autoradiographic
study
of
serotonin

.

Serotonin
transporter
(
SERT
)
has
been
associated
with
drugs
of
abuse
like
d
-
methamphetamine
(
METH
)
.

METH
is
well
known
to
produce
effects
on
the
monoamine
systems
but
it
is
unclear
how
METH
affects
SERT
and
memory
.

Here
the
effects
of
METH
and
the
serotonin
reuptake
inhibitor
fluoxetine
(
FLX
)
on
autoshaping
and
novel
object
recognition
(
NOR
)
were
investigated
.

Notably
,
both
memory
tasks
recruit
different
behavioral
,
neural
and
cognitive
demand
.

In
autoshaping
task
a

for
METH
was
determined
.

METH
(

)
impaired

)
in
autoshaping
,
indicating
that
METH
had
long

effects
in
the
latter
task
.

A

made
.

Considering
that
hemispheric
dominance
is
important
for
LTM
,
hence
right
vs
.
left
hemisphere
of
the
brain
was
compared
.

Results
showed
that
trained
animals
decreased
cortical
SERT
binding
relative
to
untrained
ones
.

In
untrained
and
trained
treated
animals
with
the
amnesic
dose
(
1
.
0mg
/
kg
)
of
METH
SERT
binding
in
several
areas
including
hippocampus
and
cortex
decreased
,
more
remarkably
in
the
trained
animals
.

In
contrast
,
FLX
improved
memory
,
increased
SERT
binding
,
prevented
the
METH
amnesic
effect
and
re
-
established
the
SERT
binding
.

In
general
,
memory
and
amnesia
seemed
to
make
SERT
more
vulnerable
to
drugs

.

Effect
of
anabolic
-
androgenic
steroids
and
glucocorticoids
on
the
kinetics
of
hAR
and
hGR
nucleocytoplasmic
translocation
.

Although
the
qualitative
nucleocytoplasmic
transport
of
nuclear
hormone
receptors
(
NHRs
)
has
been
studied
,
there
is
little
documentation
of
the
cellular
kinetics
of
this
transport
.

Here
,
translocation
studies
using
the
human
androgen
receptor
(
hAR
)
and
the
human
glucocorticoid
receptor
(
hGR
)
were
performed
to
aid
in
identifying
the
mechanism
by
which
anabolic
-
androgenic
steroids
(
AAS
)
were
activating
hAR
and
potentially
interacting
with
hGR
and
how
glucocorticoid
ligands
were
interacting
with
the
hGR
and
hAR
.

The
real
-
time
analysis
of
EGFP
-
labeled
hAR
and
hGR
ligand
-
induced
cytoplasm

nucleus
translocation
was
performed
using
fluorescence
microscopy
to
better
understand
the
action
of
these
NHRs
in
a
physiologically
relevant
cell
-
based
model
.

After
transient
transfection
,
the
hAR
and
hGR
individually
translocate
as
expected
(

transport
is
ligand

in
this

Testosterone
(

)
had
the
fastest
translocation
rate
for
the
hAR
of
0

.

The
other
endogenous
steroids
,
androstenedione
(
ANE
)
and
dihydrotestosterone
(
DHT
)
,
had
considerably
lower
hAR
transport
rates
.

The
rates
of
hAR
transport
for
the
exogenous
steroids
methyltrienelone
(
MET
)
,
nandrolone
(
NAN
)
,
and
oxandrolone
(
OXA
)
are
lower
than
that
of
testosterone
and
similar
to
those
of
the
endogenous
steroids
ANE
and
DHT
.

The
hGR
transport
rates
for
cortisol
(
COR
)
and
dexamethasone
(
DEX
)
are
also
presented
.

The
synthetic
GC
,
DEX
,
had
a
more
rapid
translocation
rate
(
0

compared
to
the
endogenous
GC

)
.

The
data
obtained
agrees
with
the
existing
qualitative
data
and
adds
an
important
ligand
-
dependent
kinetic
component
to
hAR
and
hGR
transport
.

These
kinetic
data
can
aid
our
understanding
of
NHR
action
and
interaction
with
other
regulatory

,
and
can
be
useful
in

Increased
muscarinic
receptor
activity
of
airway
smooth
muscle
isolated
from
a
mouse
model
of
allergic
asthma
.

The
mechanisms
leading
to
airway
hyper
-
responsiveness
(
AHR
)
in
asthma
are
still
not
fully
understood
.

AHR
could
be
produced
by
hypersensitivity
of
the
airway
smooth
muscle
or
hyperreactivity
of
the
airways
.

This
study
was
conducted
to
ascertain
whether
AHR
in
a
murine
model
of
asthma
is
produced
by
changes
at
the
level
of
the
airway
smooth
muscle
.

Airway
smooth
muscle
responses
were
characterised
in
vitro
in
isolated
trachea
spirals
from
naive
mice
and
from
an
acute
ovalbumin
(
OVA
)
challenge
model
of
allergic
asthma
.

AHR
was
investigated
in
vivo
in
conscious
,
freely
moving
mice
.

Inflammatory
cell
influx
into
the
lungs
and
antibody
responses
to
the
antigen
were
also
measured
.

In
vitro
study
of
tracheal
airway
smooth
muscle
from
naive
mice
demonstrated
concentration
-
related
contractions
to
methacholine
and
5
-
HT
,
but
no
responses
to
histamine
or
adenosine
or
its
stable
analogue
,
5
'
-
N
-
ethyl
-
carboxamidoadenosine
.

The
contractions
to
5
-
HT
were
inhibited
by
ketanserin
and
alosetron
indicating
involvement
of
5
-
HT
(
2A
)
and
5
-
HT
(
3
)
receptors
,
respectively
.

In
an
acute
model
of
allergic
asthma
,
OVA
-
treated
mice
were
shown
to
be
atopic
by
inflammatory
cell
influx
to
the
lungs
after
OVA
challenge
,
increases
in
total
IgE
and
OVA
-
specific
IgG
levels
and
contractions
to
OVA
in
isolated
trachea
.

In
the
asthmatic
model
,
AHR
to
methacholine
was
demonstrated
in
conscious
,
freely
moving
mice
in
vivo
and
in
isolated
trachea
in
vitro
24
and
72h
after
OVA
challenge
.

No
AHR
in
vitro
was
seen
for
5
-
HT
,
histamine
or
adenosine
.

These
results
suggest
that
,
in
our
mouse
model
of
asthma
,
changes
occur
at
the
level
of
the
muscarinic
receptor
transduction
pathway
of
coupling
to
airway
smooth
muscle
contraction
.

These
changes
are
maintained
when
tissues
are
removed
from
the
inflammatory
environment
and
for
at
least
3
days
.

Immunohistochemical
characterization
of
pyrimidine

enzymes
,
thymidine
kinase

and
thymidylate

,
in
various
types
of
cancer
.

Thymidine
kinase
-
1
(
TK
-
1
)
and
thymidylate
synthase
(
TS
)
are
key
enzymes
for
salvage
and
de
novo
pyrimidine
synthesis
,
respectively
.

Numerous
studies
have
suggested
that
increased
TS
levels
are
associated
closely
with
resistance
to
fluoropyrimidine
-
based
chemotherapy
.

TAS
-
102
is
a
novel
drug
containing
trifluorothymidine
,
which
is
phosphorylated
by
TK
-
1
to
its
active
monophosphated
form
,
that
in
turn
can
inhibit
TS
.

TAS
-
102
has
been
shown
to
exhibit
antitumor
activity
in
fluoropyrimidine
-
resistant
human
cancer
cells
.

TAS
-
102
is
currently
undergoing
clinical
trials
for
use
in
gastrointestinal
cancers
.

In
the
present
study
,
we
used
immunohistochemistry
to
investigate
the
expression
of
TK
-
1
and
TS
in
various
types
of
cancer
.

TK
-
1
and
TS
expression
was
markedly
different
between
cancer
types
.

High
TK
-
1
expression
was
detected
prominently
in
gastrointestinal
adenocarcinomas
and
esophageal
and
uterine
squamous
cell
carcinomas
.

Gastrointestinal
adenocarcinomas
and
squamous
cell
uterine
carcinomas
were
often
accompanied
by
high
TS
expression
,
indicating
activation
of
pyrimidine
synthesis
through
both
the
salvage
and
de
novo
pathways
.

These
results
led
us
to
consider
that
TAS
-
102
may
also
be
effective
for
esophageal
and
uterine
squamous
cell
carcinomas
,
as
well
as
for
gastrointestinal
adenocarcinomas
,
even
in
fluoropyrimidine
-
resistant
cases
with
high
TS
expression
.

In
contrast
,
thyroid
papillary
carcinomas
,
lung
adenocarcinomas
,
hepatocellular
carcinomas
,
pancreatic
ductal
carcinomas
,
and
renal
cell
carcinomas
,
which
exhibit
low
TK
-
1
expression
,
may
be
resistant
to
TAS
-
102
.

In
non
-
small
cell
lung
cancers
,
high
TK
-
1
expression
was
demonstrated
in
squamous
cell
carcinomas
,
but
not
in
adenocarcinomas
.

This
result
suggests
that
TAS
-
102
efficacy
and
the
pyrimidine
synthetic
pathway
may
differ
depending
on
histological
type
.

Our
results
indicate
that
administration
of
TAS
-
102
could
be
selected
on
the
basis
of
the
immunohistochemical
evaluation
of
TK
-
1
and
TS
.

Phenothiazines

S100A4
function
by
inducing
protein
oligomerization
.

S100A4
,
a
member
of
the
S100
family
of
Ca
(
2
+
)
-
binding
proteins
,
regulates
carcinoma
cell
motility
via
interactions
with
myosin
-
IIA
.

Numerous
studies
indicate
that
S100A4
is
not
simply
a
marker
for
metastatic
disease
,
but
rather
has
a
direct
role
in
metastatic
progression
.

These
observations
suggest
that
S100A4
is
an
excellent
target
for
therapeutic
intervention
.

Using
a
unique
biosensor
-
based
assay
,
trifluoperazine
(
TFP
)
was
identified
as
an
inhibitor
that
disrupts
the
S100A4
/
myosin
-
IIA
interaction
.

To
examine
the
interaction
of
S100A4
with
TFP
,
we
determined
the
2
.

A
crystal
structure
of
human
Ca
(
2
+
)
-
S100A4
bound
to
TFP
.

Two
TFP
molecules
bind
within
the
hydrophobic
target
binding
pocket
of
Ca
(
2
+
)
-
S100A4
with
no
significant
conformational
changes
observed
in
the
protein
upon
complex
formation
.

NMR
chemical
shift
perturbations
are
consistent
with
the
crystal
structure
and
demonstrate
that
TFP
binds
to
the
target
binding
cleft
of
S100A4
in
solution
.

Remarkably
,
TFP
binding
results
in
the
assembly
of
five
Ca
(
2
+
)
-
S100A4
/
TFP
dimers
into
a
tightly
packed
pentameric
ring
.

Within
each
pentamer
most
of
the
contacts
between
S100A4
dimers
occurs
through
the
TFP
moieties
.

The
Ca
(
2
+
)
-
S100A4
/
prochlorperazine
(
PCP
)
complex
exhibits
a
similar
pentameric
assembly
.

Equilibrium
sedimentation
and
cross
-
linking
studies
demonstrate
the
cooperative
formation
of
a
similarly
sized
S100A4
/
TFP
oligomer
in
solution
.

Assays
examining
the
ability
of
TFP
to
block
S100A4
-
mediated
disassembly
of
myosin
-
IIA
filaments
demonstrate
that
significant
inhibition
of
S100A4
function
occurs
only
at
TFP
concentrations
that
promote
S100A4
oligomerization
.

Together
these
studies
support
a
unique
mode
of
inhibition
in
which
phenothiazines
disrupt
the
S100A4
/
myosin
-
IIA
interaction
by
sequestering
S100A4
via
small
molecule

induced
oligomerization

Rapid
glucocorticoid
receptor
-
mediated
inhibition
of
hypothalamic

adrenal
ultradian
activity
in
healthy
males
.

A
complex
dynamic
ultradian
rhythm
underlies
the
hypothalamic
-
pituitary
-
adrenal
(
HPA
)
circadian
rhythm
.

We
have
investigated
in
normal
human
male
subjects
the
importance
,
site
of
action
,
and
receptor
-
mediated
processes
involved
in
rapid
basal
corticosteroid
feedback
and
its
interaction
with
corticotrophin
releasing
hormone
(
CRH
)
drive
.

Pro
-
opiomelanocortin
(
POMC
)
,
ACTH
,
and
cortisol
were
measured
every
10
min
from
healthy
males
during
the
awakening
period
or
late
afternoon
using
an
automated
blood
sampling
system
.

Mathematical
modeling
into
discrete
pulses
of
activity
revealed
that
intravenous
infusion
of
the
synthetic
mixed
glucocorticoid
/
mineralocorticoid
agonist
prednisolone
produced
rapid
inhibition
of
ACTH
and
cortisol
pulsatility
within
30
min
in
the
morning
and
afternoon
.

Any
pulse
that
had
commenced
at
the
time
of
injection
was
unaffected
,
and
subsequent
pulsatility
was
inhibited
.

Prednisolone
also
inhibited
ACTH
and
cortisol
secretion
in
response
to
exogenous
CRH
stimulation
,
inferring
rapid
feedback
inhibition
at
the
anterior
pituitary
.

Circulating
POMC
peptide
concentrations
were
unaffected
,
suggesting
that
the
rapid
corticosteroid
inhibitory
effect
specifically
targeted
ACTH
secretion
from
pituitary
corticotrophs
.

Prednisolone
fast
feedback
was
only
reduced
by
glucocorticoid
receptor
antagonist
pretreatment
and
not
by
mineralocorticoid
receptor
antagonism
,
suggesting
a
glucocorticoid
receptor
-
mediated
pathway
.

The
intravenous
prednisolone
suppression
test
provides
a
powerful
new
tool
to
investigate
HPA
abnormalities
underlying
metabolic
and
psychiatric
disease
states
.

The
role
of
rasagiline
in
the
treatment
of
Parkinson
'
s
disease
.

Parkinson
'
s
disease
(
PD
)
is
the
second
most
common
neurodegenerative
disorder
,
affecting
1
%
to
2
%
of
people
older
than
60
years
.

Treatment
of
PD
consists
of
symptomatic
therapies
while
neuroprotective
strategies
have
remained
elusive
.

Rasagiline
is
a
novel
,
potent
,
and
irreversible
monoamine
oxidase
type
B
(
MAO
-
B
)
inhibitor
which
has
been
approved
for
treatment
of
PD
.

Rasagiline
inhibits
MAO
-
B
more
potently
than
selegiline
and
has
the
advantage
of
once
-
daily
dosing
.

In
several
large
,
randomized
,
placebo
-
controlled
trials
,
rasagiline
has
demonstrated
efficacy
as
monotherapy
in
early
PD
and
as
adjunctive
therapy
in
advanced
PD
.

In
addition
,
rasagiline
has
been
shown
to
have
neuroprotective
effects
in
in

and
in
vivo
studies
.

Everolimus
:
the
first
approved
product
for
patients
with

Everolimus
(

Novartis
)
is
the
first
oral
inhibitor
of
mTOR
(
mammalian
target
of
rapamycin
)
to
reach
the
oncology
clinic
.

Everolimus
10
mg
daily
achieves
complete
inhibition
of
its
target
at
below
the
maximum
tolerable
dose
for
most
patients
.

A
phase
III
randomized

-
controlled
trial
has
examined
the
impact
of
everolimus
in
patients
with
clear
cell
renal
cancers
and
progressive
disease
on
or
within
6
months
of
the
VEGFR
tyrosine

)
and
25
%
were
still

,
and

.

In
2009
,
everolimus
was
approved
in
the
US
and
Europe
as
the
only
validated
option
for
this
indication
.

Toxicities
are
usually
mild
to
moderate
and
can
be
managed
with

are
seen
as

Hormonal
therapy
of
prostate
cancer
.

Of
all
cancers
,
prostate
cancer
is
the
most
sensitive
to
hormones
:
it
is
thus
very
important
to
take
advantage
of
this
unique
property
and
to
always
use
optimal
androgen
blockade
when
hormone
therapy
is
the
appropriate
treatment
.

A
fundamental
observation
is
that
the
serum
testosterone
concentration
only
reflects
the
amount
of
testosterone
of
testicular
origin
which
is
released
in
the
blood
from
which
it
reaches
all
tissues
.

Recent
data
show
,
however
,
that
an
approximately
equal
amount
of
testosterone
is
made
from
dehydroepiandrosterone
(
DHEA
)
directly
in
the
peripheral
tissues
,
including
the
prostate
,
and
does
not
appear
in
the
blood
.

Consequently
,
after
castration
,
the
95
-
97
%
fall
in
serum
testosterone
does
not
reflect
the
40
-
50
%
testosterone
(
testo
)
and
dihydrotestosterone
(
DHT
)
made
locally
in
the
prostate
from
DHEA
of
adrenal
origin
.

In
fact
,
while
elimination
of
testicular
androgens
by
castration
alone
has
never
been
shown
to
prolong
life
in
metastatic
prostate
cancer
,
combination
of
castration
(
surgical
or
medical
with
a
gonadotropin
-
releasing
hormone
(
GnRH
)
agonist
)
with
a
pure
anti
-
androgen
has
been
the
first
treatment
shown
to
prolong
life
.

Most
importantly
,
when
applied
at
the
localized
stage
,
the
same
combined
androgen
blockade
(
CAB
)
can
provide
long
-
term
control
or
cure
of
the
disease
in
more
than
90
%
of
cases
.

Obviously
,
since
prostate
cancer
usually
grows
and
metastasizes
without
signs
or
symptoms
,
screening
with
prostate
-
specific
antigen
(
PSA
)
is
absolutely
needed
to
diagnose
prostate
cancer
at
an
'
early
'
stage
before
metastasis
occurs
and
the
cancer
becomes
non
-
curable
.

While
the
role
of
androgens
was
believed
to
have
become
non
-
significant
in
cancer
progressing
under
any
form
of
androgen
blockade
,
recent
data
have
shown
increased
expression
of
the
androgen
receptor
(
AR
)
in
treatment
-
resistant
disease
with
a
benefit
of
further
androgen
blockade
.

Since
the
available
anti
-
androgens
have
low
affinity
for
AR
and
cannot
block
androgen
action
completely
,
especially
in
the
presence
of
increased
AR
levels
,
it
becomes
important
to
discover
more
potent
and
purely
antagonistic
blockers
of
AR
.

The
data
obtained
with
compounds
under
development
are
promising
.

While
waiting
for
this
(
these
)
new
anti
-
androgen
(
s
)
,
combined
treatment
with
castration
and
a
pure
anti
-
androgen
(
bicalutamide
,
flutamide
or
nilutamide
)
is
the
only
available
and
the
best
scientifically
based
means
of
treating
prostate
cancer
by
hormone
therapy
at
any
stage
of
the
disease
with
the
optimal
chance
of
success
and
even
cure
in

Predicting
cardiomyopathic
phenotypes
by
altering

affinity
of
cardiac
troponin
C
.

Cardiac
diseases
associated
with
mutations
in
troponin
subunits
include
hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy
(
HCM
)
,
dilated
cardiomyopathy
(
DCM
)
,
and
restrictive
cardiomyopathy
(
RCM
)
.

Altered
calcium
handling
in
these
diseases
is
evidenced
by
changes
in
the
Ca
(
2
+
)
sensitivity
of
contraction
.

Mutations
in
the
Ca
(
2
+
)
sensor
,
troponin
C
(
TnC
)
,
were
generated
to
increase
/
decrease
the
Ca
(
2

)
sensitivity
of
cardiac
skinned
fibers
to
create
the
characteristic
effects
of
DCM
,
HCM
,
and
RCM
.

We
also
used
a
reconstituted
assay
to
determine
the
mutation
effects
on
ATPase
activation
and
inhibition
.

One
mutant
(

)
was
found
with

-
like
properties
(
increased
Ca

.

Three
mutants
(

)
were
identified
with
RCM
-
like
properties
(
a
large
increase
in

sensitivity
,
partial

.

Two

were
identified
(

)
with

properties
(
decreased

was
utilized
to

Circular

Histamine
H4
receptor
antagonism
diminishes
existing
airway
inflammation
and
dysfunction
via
modulation
of
Th2
cytokines
.

BACKGROUND
:
Airway
remodeling
and
dysfunction
are
characteristic
features
of
asthma
thought
to
be
caused
by
aberrant
production
of
Th2
cytokines
.

Histamine
H4
receptor
(
H4R
)
perturbation
has
previously
been
shown
to
modify
acute
inflammation
and
Th2
cytokine
production
in
a
murine
model
of
asthma
.

We
examined
the
ability
of
H4R
antagonists
to
therapeutically
modify
the
effects
of
Th2
cytokine
production
such
as
goblet
cell
hyperplasia
(
GCH
)
,
and
collagen
deposition
in
a
sub
-
chronic
model
of
asthma
.

In
addition
,
effects
on
Th2
mediated
lung
dysfunction
were
also
determined
.

METHODS
:
Mice
were
sensitized
to
ovalbumin
(
OVA
)
followed
by
repeated
airway
challenge
with
OVA
.

After
inflammation
was
established
mice
were
dosed
with
the
H4R
antagonist
,
JNJ
7777120
,
or
anti
-
IL
-
13
antibody
for
comparison
.

Airway
hyperreactivity
(
AHR
)
was
measured
,
lungs
lavaged
and
tissues
collected
for
analysis
.

RESULTS
:
Therapeutic
H4R
antagonism
inhibited
T
cell
infiltration
in
to
the
lung
and
decreased
Th2
cytokines
IL
-
13
and
IL
-
5
.

IL
-
13
dependent
remodeling
parameters
such
as
GCH
and
lung
collagen
were
reduced
.

Intervention
with
H4R
antagonist
also
improved
measures
of
central
and
peripheral
airway
dysfunction
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
These
data
demonstrate
that
therapeutic
H4R
antagonism
can
significantly
ameliorate
allergen
induced
,
Th2
cytokine
driven
pathologies
such
as
lung
remodeling
and
airway
dysfunction
.

The
ability
of
H4R
antagonists
to
affect
these
key
manifestations
of
asthma
suggests
their
potential
as
novel
human
therapeutics
.

Moxifloxacin

effects
in
a

Etoposide
(
VP

)
is
a
topoisomerase

)
inhibitor
chemotherapeutic
agent
.

Studies
have
shown
that
a
combination
of
VP
-
16
with
other
drugs
demonstrates
better
clinical
responses
.

The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
investigate
the
effects
of
moxifloxacin
(
MXF
)
and
VP
-
16
on
cellular
topo

activity
in
drug
-
treated
cells
and
evaluate
the
influence
of

on
the
mode
of
action
of

,
on

and
apoptosis
of

)
and

and
VEGF

were
determined
.

MXF
or
VP

16
slightly
affected
cellular
topo
II
activity
in
nuclear
extracts
derived
from
drug
-
treated
cells
while
the
combination
enhanced
inhibitory
activity
and
the
reduction
in
band
depletion
of
topo

.

VP
-
16
induced
cell

at
G2
/
M
and
the
appearance
of
the
subG1
peak
which
was
increased
by
the
addition
of
MXF
.

Apoptosis
studies
(
DAPI
staining
and
caspase
3
activity
)
showed
a
marked
increase
in
the
presence
of
MXF
and
VP
-
16
compared
to
VP
-
16
alone
.

VP
-
16
induced
the
release
of
IL
-
8
,
and
addition
of
MXF
reduced
enhanced
release
and
the
spontaneous
release
of
VEGF
from
the
cells
.

In
conclusion
,
the
results
suggest
that
the
enhancement
in
the
reduction
of
topo
II
activity
by
the
combined
MXF
/
VP
-
16
treatments
was
probably
due
to
the
increase
in
the
level
of
the
DNA
-
enzyme
cleavable
complexes
formed
by
both
drugs
.

The
unique
combination
of
MXF
/
VP
-
16
may
have
clinical
benefits
and
a
cytotoxic
drug
'
sparing
effect
'
and
should
be
further
studied
in

associated
with
systemic
lupus
erythematosus
.

BACKGROUND
:
Systemic
lupus
erythematosus
(
SLE
)
is
a
complex
genetic
disease
;
the
histamine
H4
receptor
(
HRH4
)
has
been
shown
to
be
related
to
different
kinds
of
autoimmune
disorders
;
and
copy
number
variations
(
CNVs
)
have
been
found
to
be
associated
with
various
types
of
diseases
.

OBJECTIVES
:
To
explore
a
possible
association
between
HRH4
(
formerly
H4R
)
CNVs
and
the
risk
of
SLE
.

METHODS
:
Genomic
DNA
and
RNA
from
340
patients
with
SLE
and
392
healthy
controls
were
extracted
,
and
CNVs
and
mRNA
levels
of
HRH4
were
examined
.

RESULTS
:
The
expression
of
HRH4
mRNA
was
significantly
increased
in
patients
with
SLE
compared
with
controls
.

Amplification
of
HRH4
copy
numbers
significantly
increased
the
risk
of
SLE

Rasagiline
protects
against
alpha
-
synuclein
induced
sensitivity
to
oxidative
stress
in
dopaminergic
cells
.

Rasagiline
is
a
propargylamine
and
irreversible
monoamine
oxidase
(
MAO
)
B
inhibitor
used
for
the
treatment
of
Parkinson
'
s
disease
(
PD
)
.

It
has
demonstrated
neuroprotective
properties
in
laboratory
studies
.

Current
concepts
of
PD
aetiopathogenesis
include
the
role
of
alpha
-
synuclein
,
protein
aggregation
,
free
radical
metabolism
and
mitochondrial
dysfunction
in
contributing
to
cell
death
.

We
have
used
a
combination
of
alpha
-
synuclein
and
free
radical
mediated
toxicity
in
a
dopaminergic
cell
line
to
provide
a
model
of
nigral
toxicity
in
order
to
investigate
the
potential
molecular
mechanisms
that
mediate
rasagiline
protection
.

We
demonstrate
that
rasagiline
protects
against
cell
death
induced
by
the
combination
of
free
radicals
generated
by
paraquat
and
either
wild
-
type
or
A53T
mutant
alpha
-
synuclein
over
-
expression
.

This
protection
was
associated
with
a
reduction
in
caspase
3
activation
,
a
reduction
in
superoxide
generation
and
a
trend
to
ameliorate
the
fall
in
mitochondrial
membrane
potential
.

Rasagiline
induced
an
increase
in
cellular
glutathione
levels
.

The
results
support
a
role
for
rasagiline
in
protecting
dopaminergic
cells
against
free
radical
mediated
damage
and
apoptosis
in
the
presence
of
alpha
-
synuclein
over
-
expression
.

The
data
are
of
relevance
to
the
interpretation
of
the
potential
mechanisms
of
action
of
rasagiline
in
explaining
the
results
of
disease
modification
trials
in
PD
.

A
structural
and
functional
perspective
into
the
mechanism
of
Ca2
+
-
sensitizers
that
target
the
cardiac
troponin
complex
.

The
Ca
(
2
+
)
dependent
interaction
between
troponin
I
(
cTnI
)
and
troponin
C
(
cTnC
)
triggers
contraction
in
heart
muscle
.

Heart
failure
is
characterized
by
a
decrease
in
cardiac
output
,
and
compounds
that
increase
the
sensitivity
of
cardiac
muscle
to
Ca
(
2
+
)
have
therapeutic
potential
.

The
Ca
(
2
+
)
-
sensitizer
,
levosimendan
,
targets
cTnC
;
however
,
detailed
understanding
of
its
mechanism
has
been
obscured
by
its
instability
.

In
order
to
understand
how
this
class
of
positive
inotropes
function
,
we
investigated
the
mode
of
action
of
two
fluorine
containing
novel
analogs
of
levosimendan
;

difluoro
(

and

difluoro
(
1
,
1
'
-
biphenyl
)
-
4
-
yl
acetic
acid
(
dfbp
)
.

The
affinities
of
dfbp
and
dfbp
-
o
for
the
regulatory
domain
of
cTnC
were
measured
in
the
absence
and
presence
of
cTnI
by
NMR
spectroscopy
,
and
dfbp
-
o
was
found
to
bind
more
strongly
than
dfbp
.

Dfbp
-
o
also
increased
the
affinity
of
cTnI
for
cTnC
.

Dfbp
-
o
increased
the
Ca
(
2
+
)
-
sensitivity
of
demembranated
cardiac
trabeculae
in
a
manner
similar
to
levosimendan
.

The
high
resolution
NMR
solution
structure
of
the
cTnC
-
cTnI
-
dfbp
-
o
ternary
complex
showed
that
dfbp
-
o
bound
at
the
hydrophobic
interface
formed
by
cTnC
and
cTnI
making
critical
interactions
with
residues
such
as
Arg147
of
cTnI
.

In
the
absence
of
cTnI
,
docking
localized
dfbp
-
o
to
the
same
position
in
the
hydrophobic
groove
of
cTnC
.

The
structural
and
functional
data
reveal
that
the
levosimendan
class
of
Ca
(
2
+
)
-
sensitizers
work
by
binding
to
the
regulatory
domain
of
cTnC
and
stabilizing
the
pivotal
cTnC
-
cTnI
regulatory
unit
via
a
network
of
hydrophobic
and
electrostatic
interactions
,
in
contrast
to
the
destabilizing
effects
of
antagonists
such
as
W7
at
the
same
interface
.

Salicylate

Aspirin
(
ASA
)
and
other
non

steroidal
anti

drugs
,
which
are
cyclooxygenase
(
COX
)

,
precipitate
asthmatic

in

patients
,
while
sodium
salicylate
,
hardly
active
on
COX
by
itself
,
is
well
tolerated
by
these
patients
.

However
,
salicylate
moiety
appears
to
interfere
with
aspirin
inhibitory
action
on
platelets
and
vascular
COX
.

Such
interaction
,
if
present
at
the
level
of
respiratory
tract
,
may
be
of
interest
to
pathogenesis
of
ASA
-
induced

.

We
performed
a

of

on

in
nine
patients
.

Pulmonary

tests
,
nasal

score
,
PNIF
and
serum
salicylate
levels
were
monitored
following
challenges
with
threshold
doses
of
ASA
.

Trilisate
administered
at
a
dose
of
3000
mg
daily
for
3
days
,
offered
a
moderate
protection
against
ASA
-
induced
symptoms
;
it
diminished
the
severity
and
/
or
delayed
the
appearance
of
FEV1

.

Maximal
decreases
in
FEV1
as
well
as

were
significantly
lower
(
P

and
P

respectively
)
after
trilisate
pre
-
treatment
as
compared
to
placebo
.

Trilisate
also
attenuated
nasal
symptoms
in
three
out
of
five
patients
.

Although
the
precise
mechanism
of
the
protective
action
of
trilisate
is
unknown
,
our
data
support
the
possibility
of
interaction
between

VMAT2
:
a
dynamic
regulator
of
brain
monoaminergic
neuronal
function
interacting
with
drugs
of
abuse
.

The
monoaminergic
neuron
,
in
particular
the
dopaminergic
neuron
,
is
central
to
mediating
the
hedonic
and
addictive
properties
of
drugs
of
abuse
.

The
effects
of
amphetamine
(
AMPH
)
and
cocaine
(
COC
)
,
for
example
,
depend
on
the
ability
to
increase
dopamine
in
the
synapse
,
by
effects
on
either
the
plasma
membrane
transporter
DAT
or
the
vesicular
transporter
for
monoamine
storage
,
VMAT2
.

The
potential
role
of
DAT
as
a
target
for
AMPH
and
COC
has
been
reviewed
extensively
.

Here
,
we
present
VMAT2
as
a
target
that
enables
the
rewarding
and
addictive
actions
of
these
drugs
,
based
on
imaging
,
neurochemical
,
biochemical
,

,
and
immunohistochemical
evidence
.

The
presence
of
VMAT2
in
noradrenergic
,
serotoninergic
,
histaminergic
,
and
potentially
trace
aminergic
neurons
invites
consideration
of
a
wider
role
for
aminergic
neurotransmission
in
AMPH

Does
aspirin
acetylate
multiple
cellular
proteins
?

(
Review
)
.

Aspirin
is
a
salicylate
drug
that
is
extensively
used
for
its
anti
-
inflammatory
,
antipyretic
,
analgesic
and
anti
-
thrombotic
effects
.

More
recently
,
it
has
been
shown
to
decrease
the
incidence
of
cancers
of
epithelial
origin
.

In
most
cases
,
aspirin
is
relatively
safe
.

However
,
it
does
cause
a
host
of
adverse
effects
and
toxicities
,
including
gastrointestinal
bleeding
,
ulcerations
,
nephrotoxicity
and
hypersensitivity
reactions
.

Although
the
inhibition
of
cyclooxygenases
by
aspirin
,
which
leads
to
its
anti
-
inflammatory
/
analgesic
properties
,
has
been
well
studied
,
the
mechanisms
involved
in
its
chemopreventive
effects
as
well
as
some
of
its
adverse
effects
are
as
yet
ill
-
defined
.

Studies
over
the
past
decades
suggest
that
,
besides
cyclooxygenases
,
aspirin
acetylates
other
cellular
proteins
.

These
studies
used
radiolabeled
3H
or
14C
aspirin
,
the
only
approach
used
to
date
for
the
detection
of
proteins
acetylated
by
aspirin
.

In
a
recent
study
using
protein
-
specific
anti
-
acetyl
lysine
antibodies
and
immunological
methods
,
we
demonstrated
the
ability
of
aspirin
to
acetylate
the
tumor
suppressor
protein
p53
.

In
this
review
,
we
present
current
research
from
the
literature
on
the
aspirin
-
induced
acetylation
of
proteins
.

We
also
describe
an
immunological
approach
to
detecting
acetylated
proteins
in
aspirin
-
treated
cells
,
and
demonstrate
that
multiple
proteins
are
acetylated
.

Since
post
-
translational
modification
of
proteins
,
such
as
acetylation
,
may
lead
to
the
alteration
of
their
function
,
it
is
possible
that
some
of
the
hitherto
unexplained
beneficial
or
adverse
effects
of
aspirin
could
occur
as
a
result
of
these
modifications
.

The
identification
of
these
novel
acetylation
targets
of
aspirin
represents
a
new
area
for
investigation
.

Pseudoephedrine
inhibits
T
-
cell
activation
by
targeting
NF
-
kappaB
,
NFAT
and
AP
-
1
signaling
pathways
.

Pseudoephedrine
(
PSE
)
is
a
stereoisomer
of
ephedrine
that
is
commonly
used
as
a
nasal
decongestant
in
combination
with
other
anti
-
inflammatory
drugs
for
the
symptomatic
treatment
of
some
common
pathologies
such
as
common
cold
.

Herein
,
we
describe
for
the
first
time
the
effects
of
PSE
on
T
-
cell
activation
events
.

We
found
that
PSE
inhibits
interleukin
-
2
(
IL
-
2
)
and
tumor
necrosis
factor
(
TNF
)
alpha
-
gene
transcription
in
stimulated
Jurkat
cells
,
a
human
T
-
cell
leukemia
cell
line
.

To
further
characterize
the
inhibitory
mechanisms
of
PSE
at
the
transcriptional
level
,
we
examined
the
transcriptional
activities
of
nuclear
factor
kappa
B
(
NF
-
kappaB
)
,
nuclear
factor
of
activated
T
cells
(
NFAT
)
,
and
activator
protein
-
1
(
AP
-
1
)
transcription
factors
and
found
that
PSE
inhibited
NF
-
kappaB
-
dependent
transcriptional
activity
without
affecting
either
the
phosphorylation
,
the
degradation
of
the
cytoplasmic
NF
-
kappaB
inhibitory
protein
,
IkappaBalpha
or
the
DNA
-
binding
activity
.

However
,
phosphorylation
of
the
p65
/
RelA
subunit
was
clearly
inhibited
by
PSE
in
stimulated
cells
.

In
addition
,
PSE
inhibited
the
transcriptional
activity
of
NFAT
without
interfering
with
the
calcium
-
induced
NFAT
dephosphorylation
event
,
which
represents
the
major
signaling
pathway
for
its
activation
.

NFAT
cooperates
with
c
-
Jun
,
a
compound
of
the
AP
-
1
complex
,
to
activate
target
genes
,
and
we
also
found
that
PSE
inhibited
both
JNK
activation
and
AP
-
1
transcriptional
activity
.

These
findings
provide
new
mechanistic
insights
into
the
potential
immunomodulatory
activities
of
PSE
and
highlight
their
potential
in
designing
novel
therapeutic
strategies
to
manage
inflammatory
diseases
.

in
brain
and
adrenal
.

METHODS
:
VMAT
-
1
mRNA
was
detected
in
mouse
brain
with
RT
-
PCR
.

The
cDNA
was
sequenced
,
cloned
into
an
expression
vector
,
transfected
into
COS
-
1
cells
,
and
cell
protein
was
assayed
for
VMAT

activity
.

Immunoreactive
proteins
were
examined
on
western
blots
probed
with
four
different
antibodies
to
VMAT
-

.

RESULTS
:
Sequencing
confirmed
identity
of
the
entire
coding
sequences
of
VMAT
-
1
cDNA
from
mouse
medulla
oblongata
/
pons
and
adrenal
to
a
Gen

Bank
reference
sequence
.

Transfection
of
the
brain
cDNA
into
COS
-
1
cells
resulted
in
transporter
activity
that
was
blocked
by
the
VMAT
inhibitor
reserpine
and
a
proton
ionophore
,
but
not
by
tetrabenazine
,
which
has
a
high
affinity
for
VMAT
-

.

Antibodies
to
either
the
C
-
or
N
-
terminus
of
VMAT
-
1
detected
two
proteins
(
73
and
55
kD
)
in
transfected
COS
-
1
cells
.

The
C
-
terminal
antibodies
detected
both
proteins
in
extracts
of
mouse
medulla

pons
,
cortex
,
hypothalamus
,
and
cerebellum
but
only
the
73

proteins
in
mouse
adrenal
and
rat
PC12
cells
,
which
are
positive
controls
for
rodent

.

CONCLUSIONS
:
These
findings
demonstrate
that
a
functional
VMAT
-
1
mRNA
coding
sequence
is
expressed
in
mouse
brain
and
suggest
processing
of

The
mechanisms
responsible
for
garlic
-
drug
interactions
and
their
in
vivo
relevance
.

Garlic
phytochemicals
and
garlic
supplements
influence
the
pharmacokinetic
and
pharmacodynamic
behavior
of
concomitantly
ingested
drugs
.

In
this
paper
we
have
summarized
the
mechanisms
responsible
for
first
-
pass
intestinal
pharmacokinetic
interactions
by
investigating
the
intestinal
permeability
of
some
cardiovascular
,
antiviral
drugs
,
their
transport
with
hepatic
transporters
and
CYP3A4
metabolism
.

Transporter
-
enzyme
interplay
was
studied
with
several
in
vitro
models
of
varying
complexity
:
rat
small
intestine
and
Caco
-
2
cell
monolayers
were
used
in
studies
of
intestinal
processes
,
and
hepatic
pharmacokinetics
was
monitored
in
HepG2
cells
,
isolated
rat
hepatocytes
and
rat
liver
slices
.

Garlic
phytochemicals
from
aged
garlic
extract
modified
the
activities
of
secretory
and
absorptive
transporters
in
both
intestine
and
liver
and
competitively
inhibited
CYP3A4
enzyme
.

The
increased
activities
of
the
most
important
intestinal
efflux
(
P
-
glycoprotein
-
Pgp
,
Multidrug
Resistance
Associated

and

,
Organic

,
Peptide

-
PepT1
)
transporters
were
caused
by
changes
in
electrophysiological
membrane
properties
and
by
allosteric
modifications
.

Because
clinical
studies
investigating
interactions
between
garlic
and
human
immunodeficiency
virus
protease
inhibitors
saquinavir
and
ritonavir
have
already
been
performed
,
we
used
these
in
vivo
data
to
evaluate
the
in
vitro
results
and
the
reliability
of
the
models
employed
as
screening
tools
for
forecasting
the
potential
of
first
-
pass
intestinal
metabolism
changes
.

We
also
assessed
the
probability
of
pharmacokinetic
interactions
with
garlic
of
the
novel
drug
darunavir
and
other
cardiovascular
drugs
.

Finally
,
selected
garlic
phytochemicals
were
tested
for
their
ability
to
influence
P
-
glycoprotein
and
CYP3A4
activities
.

Cooperative

Catecholamines
(

.

The

(

at

,
as
seen
by

.

Experimental
evidence
is
presented
that
a
group
with
an
apparent
pKa
value
of
about
5

(
20
degrees

)
is
involved
in
the
interaction
between
the
catecholamine
and
the
enzyme
.

The
high

binding
of
L

to
phenylalanine
hydroxylase
,
as
studied
by
equilibrium
microdialysis
(
anaerobically
)
and
ultrafiltration
(
aerobically
)
,
shows
positive
cooperativity
(
h

)
;
at
pH
7

2
and
20
degrees
C
the
rat
enzyme
binds
about

subunit
with
a
half

maximal
binding
(

)
at

microM
L
-
noradrenaline
.

No
binding
to
the
ferrous
form
of
the
enzyme
was
observed
.

The
affinity
decreases
with
decreasing
pH
,
by
phosphorylation
and
by
preincubation
of
the
enzyme
with
the
substrate
L
-
phenylalanine
,
while
it
increases
after
alkylation
of
the
enzyme
with
the
activator
N
-
ethylmaleimide
.

Preincubation
of
the
enzyme
with
L
-
phenylalanine
also
leads
to
a
complete
loss
of
the
cooperativity
of
L
-
noradrenaline
binding
(
h
=
1
.
0
)
.

The
many
similarities
in
binding
properties
of
the
inhibitor
L
-
noradrenaline
and
the
activator
/
substrate
L
-
phenylalanine
makes
it
likely
that
the
cooperative
interactions
of
these
effectors
are
due
to
their
binding
to
the
same
site
.

The
high
-
affinity
of
catecholamines
to
phenylalanine
hydroxylase
is
a
valuable
probe
to
study
the
active
site
of
this
enzyme
and
is
also
relevant
for
the
homologous
enzyme
tyrosine
hydroxylase
,
which
is
purified
as
a
stable
catecholamine

Allelopathic

.

Preliminary
investigation
of
a
number
of
plant
extracts
for
allelopathic
activity
using
seed

inhibition
bioassay
showed
a
promising
activity
of
the
water
extract
of
the
aerial
parts
of
Mikania
scandens
.

Activity
-
guided
fractionation
of
the
M

led
to
the

of
the
highly

compound
mikanolide
,
with
minimum
inhibitory
concentration
of

.

As
M
.
scandens
is
a
highly
abundant
invasive
plant
in
Sri
Lanka
and
other
South
Asian
countries
,
this
plant
could
be
developed
as
an
environment
friendly
natural
herbicide
,
either
in
crude
form
as
shredded

material
or
as

Green
tea
extract
alleviates
arsenic
-
induced
biochemical
toxicity
and
lipid
peroxidation
in
rats
.

The
present
work
was
undertaken
to
evaluate
the
protective
effect
of
an
aqueous
extract
of
green
tea
(
GT
,
Camellia
sinensis
)
leaves
against
arsenic
(
NaAsO2
)
-
induced
biochemical
toxicity
and
lipid
peroxidation
production
in
experimental
rats
.

The
treatment
with
arsenic
exhibited
a
significant
increase
in
some
serum
hepatic
and
renal
biochemical
parameters
(
alanine
aminotransferase
,
aspartate
aminotransferase
,
alkaline
phosphatase
,
total
protein
,
albumin
,
bilirubin
,
cholesterol
,
urea
and
creatinine
)
.

But
the
co
-
administration
of
GT
has
increased
the
level
of
plasmatic
concentration
of
biochemical
parameters
.

Exposure
of
rats
to
arsenic
caused
also
a
significant
increase
in
liver
,
kidney
and
testicular
thiobarbituric
acid
reactive
substances
compared
to
control
.

However
,
the
co
-
administration
of
GT
was
effective
in
reducing
its
level
.

To
conclude
,
our
data
suggest
that
arsenic
exposure
enhanced
an
oxidative
stress
by
disturbing
the
tissue
antioxidant
defense
system
,
but
the
GT
co
-
administration
alleviates
the
toxicity
induced
by
arsenic
exposure
.

Structural
basis
for
the
altered
drug
sensitivities
of
non
-
small
cell
lung
cancer
-
associated
mutants
of
human
epidermal
growth
factor
receptor
.

The
epidermal
growth
factor
receptor
(
EGFR
)
has
an
essential
role
in
multiple
signaling
pathways
,
including
cell
proliferation
and
migration
,
through
extracellular
ligand
binding
and
subsequent
activation
of
its
intracellular
tyrosine
kinase
(
TK
)
domain
.

The
non
-
small
cell
lung
cancer
(
NSCLC
)
-
associated
EGFR
mutants
,
L858R
and
G719S
,
are
constitutively
active
and
oncogenic
.

They
display
sensitivity
to
TK
inhibitors
,
including
gefitinib
and
erlotinib
.

In
contrast
,
the
secondary
mutation
of
the
gatekeeper
residue
,
T790M
,
reportedly
confers
inhibitor
resistance
on
the
oncogenic
EGFR
mutants
.

In
this
study
,
our
biochemical
analyses
revealed
that
the
introduction
of
the
T790M
mutation
confers
gefitinib
resistance
on
the
G719S
mutant
.

The
G719S
/
T790M
double
mutant
has
enhanced
activity
and
retains
high
gefitinib
-
binding
affinity
.

The
T790M
mutation
increases
the
ATP
affinity
of
the
G719S
mutant
,
explaining
the
acquired
drug
resistance
of
the
double
mutant
.

Structural
analyses
of
the
G719S
/
T790M
double
mutant
,
as
well
as
the
wild
type
and
the
G719S
and
L858R
mutants
,
revealed
that
the
T790M
mutation
stabilizes
the
hydrophobic
spine
of
the
active
EGFR
-
TK
conformation
.

The
Met790
side
chain
of
the
G719S
/
T790M
double
mutant
,
in
the
apo
form
and
gefitinib
-
and
AMPPNP
-
bound
forms
,
adopts
different
conformations
that
explain
the
accommodation
of
these
ligands
.

In
the
L858R
mutant
structure
,
the
active
-
site
cleft
is
expanded
by
the
repositioning
of
Phe723
within
the
P
-
loop
.

Notably
,
the
introduction
of
the
F723A
mutation
greatly
enhanced
the
gefitinib
sensitivity
of
the
wild
-
type
EGFR
in
vivo
,
supporting
our
hypothesis
that
the
expansion
of
the
active
-
site
cleft
results
in
enhanced
gefitinib
sensitivity
.

Taken
together
,
our
results
provide
a
structural
basis
for
the
altered
drug
sensitivities
caused
by
distinct
NSCLC
-
associated
EGFR
mutations
.

WNT6
is
a
novel
target
gene
of
caveolin
-
1
promoting
chemoresistance
to
epirubicin
in
human
gastric
cancer
cells
.

Resistance
to
chemotherapy
is
a
major
obstacle
for
curative
treatment
of
human
gastric
cancer
(
GC
)
.

However
,
the
underlying
molecular
mechanisms
are
largely
unknown
.

Wingless
-
type
MMTV
integration
site
family
members
(
WNTs
)
are
secreted
glycoproteins
involved
in
embryogenesis
and
,
on
inappropriate
expression
in
the
adult
,
in
cancer
.

Here
,
we
show
expression
of
WNT6
in
GC
patient
specimens
,
human
GC
cell
lines
and
in
a
mouse
model
of
GC
.

In
human
GC
cells
,
WNT6
expression
was
enhanced
by
caveolin
-
1
(
Cav1
)
,
a
scaffold
protein
of
plasma
membrane
caveolae
.

WNT6
knock
-
down
and
overexpression
experiments
demonstrated
that
WNT6
increased
the
resistance
to
apoptotic
cell
death
induced
by
the
anthracycline
chemotherapeutics
epirubicin
(
Epi
)
and
doxorubicin
(
Dox
)
.

Epi
increased
the
activity
of
the
human
WNT6
promoter
through
Cav1
-
dependent
binding
of
β
-
catenin
to
the
proximal
WNT6
promoter
.

Epi
increased
both
WNT6
/
Wnt6
and
Cav1
expression
in
human
GC
cells
and
within
the
tumor
area
of
a
murine
model
of
GC
(
CEA424
-
SV40
TAg
)
.

In
GC
patients
,
WNT6
expression
was
positively
associated
with
the
tumor
stage
and
the
nodal
status
,
and
inversely
correlated
with
the
response
to
ECF
(
Epi
,
cisplatin
,
5
-
fluorouracil
)
chemotherapy
.

These
results
showed
that
WNT6
and
Cav1
are
upregulated
by
chemotherapeutics
and
enhance
the
resistance
of
GC
cells
to
anthracycline
drugs
.

Understanding
the
molecular
mechanisms
driving
WNT6
/
Cav1
-
induced
drug
resistance
will
provide
benefits
in
developing
new
therapies
for
GC
.

Differentiating
the
roles
of
mGlu2
and
mGlu3
receptors
using
LY541850
,
an
mGlu2
agonist
/
mGlu3
antagonist
.

Despite
the
potential
therapeutic
relevance
of
group
II
metabotropic
glutamate
(
mGlu
)
receptors
,
there
has
been
a
lack
of
pharmacological
tools
for
separating
the
roles
of
mGlu2
and
mGlu3
receptor
subtypes
.

LY541850
was
claimed
from
human
mGlu
receptors
expressed
in
non
-
neuronal
cells
to
be
a
selective
orthosteric
mGlu2
agonist
and
mGlu3
antagonist
.

We
have
verified
this
pharmacological
profile
of
LY541850
in
hippocampal
slices
.

Field

were
inhibited
by
LY541850
in

nM
)
and
wild

type
littermates
(
EC

)
42
nM
)
to
a
similar
extent
but
were
not
significantly
affected
in
mGlu2

/
-
mice
.

The
group
II
agonist
,
DCG
-
IV
,
inhibited
the
fEPSP
in
all
three
genotypes
.

Co
-
application
of
DCG
-
IV
and
LY541850
in
mGlu3
-
/
-
and
wild
-
type
littermates
resulted
in
an
additive
effect
,
whereas
in
mGlu2
-
/
-
mice
,
LY541850
reversed
the
inhibitory
action
of
DCG
-
IV
.

These
results
confirm
the
selective
mGlu2
agonist
and
mGlu3
antagonist
actions
of
LY541850
.

A
similar
profile
of
activity
was
seen
in
medial
perforant
path
synapse
to
the
dentate
gyrus
.

Systemic
administration
of
LY541850
to
wild
-
type
mice
,
reduced
the
increase
in
locomotor
activity
following
both
phencyclidine
and
amphetamine
administration
.

These
data
support
the
hypothesis
that
mGlu2
receptors
mediate
the
antipsychotic
effects
of
mixed
group
II
agonists
.

Levels
of
eukaryotic

4E
(
eIF4E
)
are
frequently
elevated
in
human
cancers
and
in
some
instances
have
been
associated
with
poor
prognosis
and
outcome
.

Here
we
utilize
transgenic
and
allograft
breast
cancer
models
to
demonstrate
that
increased
mammalian
target
of
rapamycin
(
mTOR
)
signalling
can
be
a
significant
contributor
to
breast

,
which

,
is
inhibited

Our

indicate
that
the

is
an
important

to
tumor

programs
in

modafinil
(
armodafinil
)
:
a
unique
dopamine
uptake
inhibitor
and
potential
medication
for
psychostimulant

.

BACKGROUND
:
(
+
/
-
)
-
Modafinil
has
piqued
interest
as
a
treatment
for
attention
-
deficit
/
hyperactivity
disorder
and
stimulant
dependence
.

The
R
-
enantiomer
of
modafinil
might
have
unique
pharmacological
properties
that
should
be
further
investigated
.

METHODS
:
(

-
)
-
Modafinil
and
its
R
-
(
-
)
-
and
S
-
(
+
)
-
enantiomers
were
synthesized
and
tested
for
inhibition
of
[
(

)
H
]
dopamine
(
DA
)
uptake
and
[
(

WIN

binding
in
human
dopamine
transporter
(
DAT
)
wild
-
type
and
mutants
with
altered
conformational
equilibria
.

Data
were
compared
with
cocaine
and
the
atypical
DA
uptake
inhibitor
,
JHW

.

R
-
and
S
-
modafinil
were
also
evaluated
in
microdialysis
studies
in
the
mouse
nucleus
accumbens
shell
and
in
a
cocaine
discrimination
procedure
.

RESULTS
:
(
+
/
-
)
-
,
R
-
,
and
S
-
modafinil
bind
to
the
DAT
and
inhibit
DA
uptake
less
potently
than
cocaine
,
with
R
-
modafinil
having
approximately
threefold
higher
affinity
than
its
S
-
enantiomer
.

Molecular
docking
studies
revealed
subtle
differences
in
binding
modes
for
the
enantiomers
.

R
-
modafinil
was
significantly
less
potent
in
the
DAT
Y156F
mutant
compared
with
wild
-
type
DAT
,
whereas
S
-
modafinil
was
affected
less
.

Studies
with
the
Y335A
DAT
mutant
showed
that
the
R
-
and
S
-
enantiomers
tolerated
the
inward
-
facing
conformation
better
than
cocaine
,
which
was
further
supported
by
[
2
-
(
trimethylammonium
)
ethyl
]
-
methanethiosulfonate
reactivity
on
the
DAT
E2C
I159C
.

Microdialysis
studies
demonstrated
that
both
R
-
and
S
-
modafinil
produced
increases
in
extracellular
DA
concentrations
in
the
nucleus
accumbens
shell
less
efficaciously
than
cocaine
and
with
a
longer
duration
of
action
.

Both
enantiomers
fully
substituted
in
mice
trained
to
discriminate
cocaine
from
saline
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
R
-
modafinil
displays
an
in
vitro
profile
different
from
cocaine
.

Future
trials
with
R
-
modafinil
as
a
substitute
therapy
with
the
potential
benefit
of
cognitive
enhancement
for
psychostimulant
addiction
are
warranted
.

MUC1
-
C
oncoprotein
as
a
target
in
breast
cancer
:
activation
of
signaling
pathways
and
therapeutic
approaches
.

Mucin
1
(
MUC1
)
is
a
heterodimeric
protein
formed
by
two
subunits
that
is
aberrantly
overexpressed
in
human
breast
cancer
and
other
cancers
.

Historically
,
much
of
the
early
work
on
MUC1
focused
on
the
shed
mucin
subunit
.

However
,
more
recent
studies
have
been
directed
at
the
transmembrane
MUC1
-
C
-
terminal
subunit
(
MUC1
-
C
)
that
functions
as
an
oncoprotein
.

MUC1
-
C
interacts
with
EGFR
(
epidermal
growth
factor
receptor
)
,
ErbB2
and
other
receptor
tyrosine
kinases
at
the
cell
membrane
and
contributes
to
activation
of
the
PI3K

AKT
and
mitogen
-
activated
protein
kinase
kinase
(
MEK
)

extracellular
signal
-
regulated
kinase
(
ERK
)
pathways
.

MUC1
-
C
also
localizes
to
the
nucleus
where
it
activates
the
Wnt
/
β
-
catenin
,
signal
transducer
and
activator
of
transcription
(
STAT
)
and
NF
(
nuclear
factor
)
-
κB
RelA
pathways
.

These
findings
and
the
demonstration
that
MUC1
-
C
is
a
druggable
target
have
provided
the
experimental
basis
for
designing
agents
that
block
MUC1
-
C
function
.

Notably
,
inhibitors
of
the
MUC1
-
C
subunit
have
been
developed
that
directly
block
its
oncogenic
function
and
induce
death
of
breast
cancer
cells
in
vitro
and
in
xenograft
models
.

On
the
basis
of
these
findings
,
a
first
-
in
-
class
MUC1
-
C
inhibitor
has
entered
phase
I
evaluation
as
a
potential
agent
for
the
treatment
of
patients
with
breast
cancers
who
express
this
oncoprotein
.

Silibinin
triggers
apoptosis
and
cell
-
cycle
arrest
of
SGC7901
cells
.

Silibinin
,
a
flavonoid
compound
,
has
shown
to
be
of
chemopreventive
potential
against
many
cancers
.

However
,
its
efficacy
against
gastric
cancer
has
not
been
well
elucidated
.

Here
,
we
assessed
the
activity
of
Silibinin
on
apoptosis
and
cell
-
cycle
arrest
in
human
gastric
cells
culture
system
using
SGC
-
7901
as
the
model
.

Silibinin
treatment
could
inhibit
the
cell
growth
and
cause
a
prominent
G2
phase
arrest
and
apoptosis
in
dose
-
and
time
-
dependent
manner
.

In
mechanistic
studies
,
Silibinin
decreased
the
protein
level
of
p34cdc2
,
which
might
be
the
possible
molecular
mechanism
of
Silibinin
efficacy
on
the
growth
inhibition
in
SGC
-
7901
cells
.

In
addition
,
Silibinin
caused
an
increase
in
p53
and
p21
protein
level
as
well
as
mRNA
levels
.

Interestingly
,
Silibinin
-
induced
apoptosis
in
SGC
-
7901
cells
was
independent
of
caspases
activation
.

These
results
indicated
that
Silibinin
is
a
cell
-
cycle
regulator
and
apoptosis
inducer
in
human
gastric
carcinoma
SGC
-
7901
cells
and
might
be
used
as
a
candidate
chemopreventive
agent
for
gastric
carcinoma
prevention
and
intervention
.

produced
anxiolytic

Herein
,
we
report
the
pharmacological
actions
of

.

In
all
models
,
except
Vogel
'
s
conflict
test
,
a
dose

anxiolytic
-
like
effect
was
seen
.

The
anti

hyperthermic
effect
of
Lu
AF21934
(
5
mg
/
kg
)
in
the
SIH
test
was
inhibited
by
the
benzodiazepine
receptor
antagonist
flumazenil
(
10
mg
/

)
and
was
not
serotonin

,
as
it
persisted
in
serotonin

deficient
mice
and
upon
blockade
of
either
5

receptors
by

,
or
5
-
HT
(

.

These
results
suggest
that
the
GABAergic
system
,
but
not
the
serotonergic
system
,
is
involved
in
the
mechanism
of
the
anxiolytic
-

of

did
not
produce
antidepressant

in
the

;
however
,
it
decreased

The
interaction
between
mGluR1
and
the
calcium
channel
Cav₂
.
₁
preserves
coupling
in
the
presence
of
long
Homer
proteins
.

Group
I
metabotropic
glutamate
receptors
(
mGluR1
and
5
)
are
G
protein
coupled
receptors
that
regulate
neuronal
activity
in
a
number
of
ways
.

Some
of
the
most
well
studied
functions
of
group
I
mGluRs
,
such
as
initiation
of
multiple
forms
of
mGluR
-
dependent
long
-
term
depression
,
require
receptor
localization
near
the
post
-
synaptic
density
(
PSD
)
.

This
localization
is
in
turn
dependent
on
the
Homer
family
of
scaffolding
proteins
which
bind
to
a
small
motif
on
the
distal
C
-
termini
of
mGluR1
and
5
,
localize
the
receptors
near
the
PSD
,
strengthen
coupling
to
post
-
synaptic
effectors
and
simultaneously
uncouple
the
mGluRs
from
extra
-
synaptic
effectors
such
as
voltage
dependent
ion
channels
.

Here
the
selectivity
of
this
uncoupling
process
was
examined
by
testing
the
ability
of
Homer
-
2b
to
uncouple
mGluR1
from
multiple
voltage
dependent
calcium
channels
including
Ca
(
V2
.
2
)
(
N
-
type
)
,
Ca
(
V3
.

)
(
T
-
type
)
,
and
Ca
(
V2
.
1
)
(
P
/
Q
-
type
)
expressed
in
rat
sympathetic
neurons
from
the
superior
cervical
ganglion
(
SCG
)
.

Of
these
,
only
the
mGluR1
-
Ca
(
V2
.
1
)
modulatory
pathway
was
insensitive
to
Homer
-
2b
expression
.

Uncoupling
from
this
channel
was
achieved
by
co
-
expression
of
an
mGluR1
C
-
terminal
protein
designed
to
disrupt
a
previously
described
direct
interaction
between
these
two
proteins
,
suggesting
that
this
interaction
allows
incorporation
of
Ca
(
V2

)
into
the
mGluR1
/
Homer
signaling
complex
,
thereby
preserving

The
potential
of
nicotinic
enhancement
of
cognitive
remediation
training
in
schizophrenia
.

Cognitive
deficits
in
schizophrenia
are
critically
important
predictors
of
long
-
term
psychosocial
outcome
and
are
not
significantly
ameliorated
by
currently
available
medications
.

Cognitive
remediation
training
has
shown
promise
for
alleviating
cognitive
symptoms
of
schizophrenia
,
but
the
clinical
significance
has
often
been
limited
by
small
effect
sizes
.

Approaches
that
achieve
larger
improvement
involve
time
requirements
that
can
be
cost
-
prohibitive
within
the
current
clinical
care
system
.

This
mini
-
review
evaluates
the
theoretical
potential
of
a
pharmacological
enhancement
strategy
of
cognitive
remediation
training
with
nicotinic
acetylcholine
receptor
(
nAChR
)
agonists
.

nAChR
agonists
can
facilitate
sensory
processing
,
alertness
,
attention
,
learning
and
memory
.

While
these
effects
may
be
too
subtle
and
short
-
lasting
to
be
of
clinical
relevance
as
a
primary
treatment
of
cognitive
deficits
,
they
constitute
an
ideal
effects
profile
for
enhancing
training
benefits
.

Several
mechanisms
are
described
through
which
repeated
coupling
of
cognitive
training
challenges
with
nAChR
stimulation
may
enhance
and
accelerate
cognitive
remediation
training
effects
,
advancing
such
interventions
into
more
effective
and
practicable
treatments
of
some
of
the
most
debilitating
symptoms
of
schizophrenia

an
orphan
disease
associated
with
chylomicronemia
,
severe
hypertriglyceridemia
,
metabolic
complications
and
potentially
life

The
LPL
(

gene
variant
,
in
an
adeno

associated
viral
vector
of
serotype

(
alipogene

)
,
was
administered
to
14
adult
LPLD
patients
with
a
prior
history
of
pancreatitis
.

Primary
objectives
were
to
assess
the
long

term
safety
of
alipogene
tiparvovec
and
achieve
a

40
%
reduction
in

)
at
3

and
3
also
received
immunosuppressants
from
the
time
of

and
continued
for

.

Alipogene
tiparvovec
was
well

Half
of
the
patients
demonstrated
a

We
have
previously
shown
the
anti

;
however
,
pharmacokinetic
analysis
showed
that
swertiamarin
had
a
plasma
half

of
1
.
3
h
.

Gentianine
is
an
active
metabolite
of
swertiamarin
that
possesses
a
pharmacophoric
moiety
.

The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
explore
the
possibility
whether
the
anti
-
diabetic
effect
of
swertiamarin
is
due
to
gentianine
.

Swertiamarin
treatment
had
no
significant
effect
on
adipogenesis
,
or
the
mRNA
expression
of
PPAR
-
γ
and
GLUT
-

;
however
,
there
was
a

increase
in
the

On
the
other
hand
,
treatment
with
gentianine
significantly
increased
adipogenesis
,
which
was
associated
with
a
significant
increase
in
the
mRNA
expression
of
PPAR
-
γ
,
GLUT
-
4
and
adiponectin
.

These
findings
suggest
,
for
the
first
time
,
that
the
anti

diabetic
effect
of
swertiamarin
is
due
to
gentianine
,
an
active
metabolite
of
swertiamarin
.

Cognitive

it
is
not

new

Disrupted

In

Passive
stiffness
of
airway
smooth
muscle
:
the
next
target
for
improving
airway
distensibility
and
treatment
for
asthma
?

Reduced
airway
distensibility
due
to
increased
airway
stiffness
is
a
characteristic
of
asthma
.

Airway
stiffness
is
determined
by
the
property
and
structural
organization
of
the
various
elements
of
the
airway
wall
,
and
is
often
divided
into
active
and
passive
components
.

Active
stiffness
is
thought
to
be
associated
with
activation
of
muscle
cells
in
the
airway
wall
.

This
component
of
stiffness
can
be
inhibited
when
active
force
produced
by
the
muscle
is
abolished
.

Passive
stiffness
,
on
the
other
hand
,
is
thought
to
stem
from
non
-
muscle
component
of
the
airway
wall
,
especially
the
collagen
/
elastin
fibrous
network
of
the
extracellular
matrix
within
which
the
muscle
cells
are
embedded
.

In
this
brief
review
,
the
notion
that
passive
stiffness
is
exclusively
extracellular
in
origin
is
challenged
.

Recent
evidence
suggests
that
a
substantial
portion
of
the
passive
stiffness
of
an
in
vitro
preparation
of
tracheal
smooth
muscle
is
calcium
sensitive
and
is
regulated
by
Rho
-
kinase
,
although
the
underlying
mechanism
and
the
details
of
regulation
for
the
development
of
this
intracellular
passive
stiffness
are
still
largely
unknown
.

To
reduce
airway
stiffness
different
lines
of
attack
must
be
tailored
to
different
components
of
the
stiffness
.

The
regulatable
passive
stiffness
is
distinct
from
the
relatively
permanent
stiffness
of
the
extracellular
matrix
and
the
stiffness
associated
with
active
muscle
contraction
.

To
improve
airway
distensibility
during
asthma
exacerbation
,
a
comprehensive
approach
to
reduce
overall
airway
stiffness
should
therefore
include
a
strategy
for
targeting
the
regulatable
passive
stiffness
.

Protective
Effects
of
a
Purified
Saponin
Mixture
from
Astragalus
corniculatus

.
,
in
vivo
Hepatotoxicity
Models
.

In
this
study
,
the
in
vivo
effects
of
a
purified
saponin
mixture
(
PSM
)
,
obtained
from
Astragalus
corniculatus
Bieb
.
,
were
investigated
using
two
in
vivo
hepatotoxicity
models
based
on
liver
damage
caused
by
paracetamol
(
PC
)
and
carbon
tetrachloride
(
CCl4
)
.

The
effects
of
PSM
were
compared
with
silymarin
.

Male
Wistar
rats
were
challenged
orally
with
20
%
CCl4
or
PC
(
2
g
/
kg
)
four
days
after
being
pre
-
treated
with
PSM
(
100
mg
/
kg
)
or
silymarin
(
200
mg
/
kg
)
.

A
significant
decrease
of
aspartate
aminotransferase
,
alanine
aminotransferase
,
lactate
dehydrogenase
(
LDH
)
activities
and
glutathione
(
GSH
)
levels
and
an
increase
of
malondialdehyde
(
MDA
)
quantity
was
observed
after
CCl4
and
PC
administration
alone
.

PSM
pre
-
treatment
decreased
serum
transaminases
and
LDH
activities
and
MDA
levels
and
increased
the
levels
of
cell
protector
GSH
.

Biotransformation
phase
I
enzymes
were
also
assessed
in
both
models
.

In
the
CCl4
hepatotoxicity
model
,
pre
-
treatment
with
PSM
or
silymarin
resulted
in
significantly
increased
activities
of
ethylmorphine
-
N
-
demethylase
and
aniline
4
-
hydroxylase
activity
and
cytochrome
P450
,
compared
to
the
CCl4
only
group
.

Neither
silymarin
nor
PSM
influenced
PC
biotransformation
.

Our
results
suggest
that
PSM
,
obtained
from
A
.
corniculatus
,
Bieb
.
showed
in
vivo
hepatoprotective
and
antioxidant
activities
against
CCl4
and
PC
-
induced
liver
damage
comparable
to
that
of
silymarin

Current
understanding
of
TRPM7
pharmacology
and
drug
development
for
stroke
.

The
initial
excitement
and
countless
efforts
to
find
a
pharmacological
agent
that
disrupts
the
excitotoxic
pathway
of
ischemic
neuronal
death
have
only
led
to
disappointing
clinical
trials
.

Currently
,
a
thrombolytic
agent
called
recombinant
tissue
plasminogen
activator
(
rt
-
PA
)
is
the
only
pharmacological
treatment
available
for
patients
with
acute
ischemic
stroke
in
most
countries
.

Even
though
its
efficacy
has
been
confirmed
repeatedly
,
rt
-
PA
is
considerably
underused
due
to
reasons
including
a
short
therapeutic
window
and
repeated
complications
associated
with
its
use
.

A
search
for
alternative
mechanisms
that
may
operate
dependently
or
independently
with
the
well
-
established
excitotoxic
mechanism
has
led
researchers
to
the
discovery
of
newly
described
non
-
glutamate
mechanisms
.

Among
the
latter
,
transient
receptor
potential
melastatin
7
(
TRPM7
)
is
one
of
the
important
nonglutamate
mechanisms
in
stroke
,
which
has
been
evaluated
in
both
in
-
vitro
and
in
-
vivo
.

In
this
review
,
we
will
discuss
the
current
state
of
pharmacological
treatments
of
ischemic
stroke
and
provide
evidence
that
TRPM7
is
a
promising
therapeutic
target
of
stroke
.

Hospitalized
osteoporotic
vertebral
fracture
increases
the
risk
of
stroke
:
a
population
-
based
cohort
study
.

The
association
between
osteoporosis
and
cardiovascular
diseases
has
been
demonstrated
.

Higher
cardiovascular
risk
has
also
been
correlated
with
vertebral
fractures
.

However
,
the
association
between
osteoporotic
vertebral
fracture
and
the
possibly
higher
risk
of
stroke
remains
uncertain
.

This
study
aimed
to
evaluate
the
incidence
,
risk
,
and
type
of
stroke
in
patients
with
osteoporotic
vertebral
fracture
.

Patients
with
osteoporotic
vertebral
fracture
were
identified
(
n
=
380
)
and
10
age
-
and
sex
-
matched
controls
per
case
(
comparison
group
,
n
=
3795
)
were
chosen
from
a
nationwide
representative
cohort
of
999
,
997
people
from
1998
to
2005
.

Both
groups
were
followed
-
up
for
stroke
events
for
3
years
,
matched
by
propensity
scores
with
adjustments
for
covariates
such
as
comorbidities
(
ie
,
hypertension
,
diabetes
,
arrhythmia
,
or
coronary
heart
diseases
)
and
exposure
to
medications
(
ie
,
aspirin
,
lipid
lowering
drug
,
or
nitrates
)
,
and
assessed
by
Kaplan
-
Meier
and
Cox
regression
analyses
.

The
incidence
rate
of
stroke
in
the
osteoporotic
vertebral
fracture
group
(
37

per
1000
person

;
95
%

interval
[

was
significantly
higher
than
in
the

.

Stroke
was
more
likely
to
occur
in
the
osteoporotic

than
in

.

In
conclusion
,
patients
with
osteoporotic
vertebral
fracture
have
a
higher
risk
of
stroke
(
ie
,
both
ischemic
and

)
and

(
ET1
)
,
acetylcholine
(
Ach
)
,
sodium

(
SNP
)
and
isoproterenol
(
ISO
)
were
evaluated
in
glycerol
-
induced
acute
kidney
injury
in
rats
.

The
effect
of
PE
on
fenofibrate
-
treated
animals
was
a
dose
-
dependent
increase
in
mean
arterial
blood
pressure
(
MAP
)
.

For
AII
and
ET1
,
MAP
was
also
increased
for
the
fenofibrate
group
but
not
in
a
dose
-
dependent
fashion
.

On
the
medullary
blood
flow
(
MBF
)
,
while
the
lower
doses
of
PE
and
AII
increased
the
perfusion
unit
on
the
fenofibrate
-
treated
group
,
the
higher
doses
decreased
the
perfusion
unit
.

The
ET1
increased
the
perfusion
unit
on
this
group
but
not
in
dose
-
dependent
fashion
.

The
effects
of
PE
and
AII
on
the
cortical
blood
flow
(
CBF
)
of
fenofibrate
-
treated
group
is
similar
to
that
of
MBF
for
the
same
group
but
not
for
ET1
.

The
effect
of
Ach
,
SNP
and
ISO
in
all
the
groups
was
the
decrease
in
MAP
.

ISO
caused
dose
-
dependent
increase
in
MBF
of
fenofibrate
-
treated
group
.

The
effect
of
Ach
,
SNP
and
ISO
on
the
CBF
perfusion
unit
was
that
of
the
increase
for
the
fenofibrate
-
treated
group
.

The
study
showed
that
fenofibrate
did
not
attenuate
increased
blood
pressure
induced
by
PE
,
AII
and
ET1
but
caused
enhanced
vasodilation
by
Ach
,
SNP
and
ISO
.

The
R740S
mutation
in
the
V
-
ATPase
a3
subunit
increases
lysosomal
pH
,
impairs
NFATc1
translocation
,
and
decreases
in
vitro
osteoclastogenesis
.

Vacuolar
H
(
+
)
-
ATPase
(
V
-
ATPase
)
,
a
multisubunit
enzyme
located
at
the
ruffled
border
and
in
lysosomes
of
osteoclasts
,
is
necessary
for
bone
resorption
.

We
previously
showed
that
heterozygous
mice
with
an
R740S
mutation
in
the
a3
subunit
of
V
-
ATPase
(
+
/
R740S
)
have
mild
osteopetrosis
resulting
from
an
∼
90
%
reduction
in
proton
translocation
across
osteoclast
membranes
.

Here
we
show
that
lysosomal
pH
is
also
higher
in
+
/
R740S
compared
with
wild
-
type
(
+
/
+
)
osteoclasts
.

Both
osteoclast
number
and
size
were
decreased
in
cultures
of
+
/
R740S
compared
with
+
/
+
bone
marrow
cells
,
with
concomitant
decreased
expression
of
key
osteoclast
markers
(
TRAP
,
cathepsin
K
,
OSCAR
,
DC
-
STAMP
,
and
NFATc1
)
,
suggesting
that
low
lysosomal
pH
plays
an
important
role
in
osteoclastogenesis
.

To
elucidate
the
molecular
mechanism
of
this
inhibition
,
NFATc1
activation
was
assessed
.

NFATc1
nuclear
translocation
was
significantly
reduced
in
+
/
R740S
compared
with
+
/
+
cells
;
however
,
this
was
not
because
of
impaired
enzymatic
activity
of
calcineurin
,
the
phosphatase
responsible
for
NFATc1
dephosphorylation
.

Protein
and
RNA
expression
levels
of
regulator
of
calcineurin
1
(
RCAN1
)
,
an
endogenous
inhibitor
of
NFATc1
activation
and
a
protein
degraded
in
lysosomes
,
were
not
significantly
different
between
+
/
R740S
and
+
/
+
osteoclasts
,
but
the
RCAN1
/
NFATc1
ratio
was
significantly
higher
in
+
/
R740S
versus
+
/
+
cells
.

The
lysosomal
inhibitor
chloroquine
significantly
increased
RCAN1
accumulation
in
+
/
+
cells
,
consistent
with
the
hypothesis
that
higher
lysosomal
pH
impairs
RCAN1
degradation
,
leading
to
a
higher
RCAN1
/
NFATc1
ratio
and
consequently
NFATc1
inhibition
.

Our
data
indicate
that
increased
lysosomal
pH
in
osteoclasts
leads
to
decreased
NFATc1
signaling
and
nuclear
translocation
,
resulting
in
a
cell
autonomous
impairment
of
osteoclastogenesis
in
vitro
.

AKRs

The
role

Aldo

keto
reductases
(
AKRs
)
metabolize
a
wide
range
of
substrates
,
including
polycyclic
aromatic
hydrocarbons
(
PAHs
)
,
generating
metabolites
(
o
-
quinones
)
and
reactive
oxygen
species
(
ROS
)
,
which
are
capable
of
initiating
and
promoting
carcinogenesis
.

Exposure
to
PAHs
,
their
metabolites
,
and
ROS
further
increase
AKRs
isoform
expression
that
may
amplify
oxidative
damage
.

Human
AKR
enzymes
are
highly
polymorphic
,
and
allelic
variants
may
contribute
to
different
AKRs
expression
in
individuals
.

Despite
the
importance
of
AKRs
in
PAHs
metabolism
,
there
are
no
studies
that
evaluate
,
in
general
human
populations
,
the
effect
of
PAHs
on
AKRs
expression
in
peripheral
blood
lymphocytes
(
PBLs
)
.

The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
determine
the
effect
of
tobacco

,
and

on

In
the

However
,
AKR1A1

and
AKR1C3
*
2
alleles
did
not
influence
AKR1A1
and
AKR1C1
-

mRNA
levels
.

These
results
suggest
that
AKRs
induction
by
PAHs

PBLs
is
associated
with
BMI
;
therefore
,
the
role

Transforming

beta
(
TGF

)
is
one
of
the
major
players
in
determining
the
structural
and
functional
abnormalities
of
the
ASM
in
asthma
and
COPD
.

It
is
increasingly
evident
that
TGF

β
functions
as
a
master
switch
,
controlling
a
network
of
intracellular
and
autocrine
signaling
loops
that
effect
ASM

and

.

In
this
review
,
the
various
elements
that
participate
in
non

,
including
MAPK

are
discussed

focusing
on
their

In

new

Thiazolidinediones
(
TZDs
)
affect
osteoblast
viability
and
biomarkers
independently
of
the
TZD
effects
on
aromatase
.

Thiazolidinediones
(
TZDs
)
are
insulin
sensitizers
used
for
treatment
of
diabetes
.

We
have
previously
reported
that
TZDs
reduce
estrogen
synthesis
by
inhibiting
aromatase
activity
in
human
granulosa
cells
(
HGC
)
.

Multiple
clinical
trials
demonstrated
that
TZDs
increase
the
risk
of
fractures
in
postmenopausal
women
with
type
2
diabetes
.

We
studied
mouse
osteoblasts
alone
or
in
a
co
-
culture
with
HGC
to
determine
whether
TZD
inhibition
of
aromatase
plays
a
role
in
their
effects
on
bone
metabolism
.

Mouse
osteoblasts
were
cultured
with
and
without
HGC
,
and
incubated
in
a
medium
with
or
without
testosterone
,
pioglitazone
or
rosiglitazone
.

Cell
growth
,
oleic
acid
uptake
,
alkaline
phosphatase
activity
,
and
osteocalcin
production
were
measured
.

TZDs
inhibited
estradiol
production
by
up
to
84
%
in
HGC
/
mouse
osteoblast
co
-
cultures
.

TZDs
induced
mouse
osteoblast
death
and
increased
oleic
acid
uptake
.

TZDs
also
inhibited
alkaline
phosphatase
activity
(
58
-
75
%
,
p
<
0
.
046
)
and
osteocalcin
production
(
52
-
75
%
,
p
<
0
.
031
)
.

For
all
the
parameters
,
there
were
no
significant
differences
between
the
osteoblast
cultures
alone
and
the
HCG
/
osteoblast
co
-
cultures
.

TZD
effects
on
osteoblast
viability
,
oleic
acid
uptake
,
alkaline
phosphatase
and
osteocalcin
production
are
independent
of
their
effects
on
aromatase
.

Theoretical
study
of
the
decomposition
of
ethyl
and
ethyl
3
-
phenyl
glycidate
.

The
mechanism
of
the
decomposition
of
ethyl
and
ethyl
3
-
phenyl
glycidate
in
gas
phase
was
studied
by
density
functional
theory
(
DFT
)
and
MP2
methods
.

A
proposed
mechanism
for
the
reaction
indicates
that
the
ethyl
side
of
the
ester
is
eliminated
as
ethylene
through
a
concerted
six
-
membered
cyclic
transition
state
,
and
the
unstable
intermediate
glycidic
acid
decarboxylates
rapidly
to
give
the
corresponding
aldehyde
.

Two
possible
pathways
for
glycidic
acid
decarboxylation
were
studied
:
one
via
a
five
-
membered
cyclic
transition
state
,
and
the
other
via
a
four
-
membered
cyclic
transition
state
.

The
results
of
the
calculations
indicate
that
the
decarboxylation
reaction
occurs
via
a
mechanism
with
five
-
membered
cyclic
transition
state
.

Multidrug

associated
proteins
are
involved
in
the
transport
of
the
glutathione
conjugates
of
the
ultimate
carcinogen
of
benzo
[
a

pyrene
in
human
Caco

cells
.

A
wide
variety
of
contaminants
are
ingested
through
food
,
among
them
the
pro
-
carcinogenic
polycyclic
aromatic
hydrocarbon
benzo
[
a
]
pyrene
(
BP
)
that
is
resorbed
and
partially
metabolized
in
the
enterocytes
of
the
small
intestine
.

Previous
in
vitro
studies
have
revealed
that
BP
phenols
are
excreted
as
Phase
II
metabolites
including
glucuronides
and
sulfates
.

This
export
is
mediated
by
the
breast
cancer
resistance
protein
(
ABCG2
)
.

The
ultimate
carcinogenic
Phase
I
BP
metabolite
anti
-
BP
-
7
,
8
-
dihydrodiol
-

,

-
epoxide
(
BPDE
)
can
be
detoxified
by
glutathione
conjugate
formation
catalyzed
by
glutathione
S
-
transferases
.

In
the
present
study
,
differentiated
human
intestinal
Caco
-
2
cells
were
used
as
a
model
for
the
human
small
intestine
to
investigate
the
detoxification
of
BPDE
and
excretion
of
stereoisomeric
glutathione
conjugates
in
the
presence
of
an
inhibitor
of
the
glutathione
-
cleaving
enzyme
γ
-
glutamyl
transpeptidase
at
the
cell
surface
.

The
results
indicate
that
the
glutathione
conjugates
of
BPDE
are
formed
and
excreted
mainly
to
the
apical
and
to
a
minor
extent
to
the
basolateral
side
of
polarized
Caco
-
2
monolayers
.

Inhibition
studies
revealed
that
the
multidrug
resistance
-
associated
proteins
(
ABCCs
)
are
involved
in
the
transport
of
BPDE
glutathione
conjugates
.

Stable
ABCC1
,
ABCC2
and
ABCC3
knockdown
cell
lines
were
generated
,
thus
making
it
possible
to
demonstrate
that
ABCC1
mediates
the
basolateral
and
ABCC2
the
apical
excretion
of
BPDE
glutathione
conjugates
.

In
conclusion
,
the
ultimate
carcinogen
BPDE
is
detoxified
via
glutathione
conjugation
and
subsequently
excreted
by
Caco
-
2
cells
in
both
apical
and
basolateral
directions
.

This
finding
is
equivalent
to
a
transport
into
feces
as
well
as
blood
system
in
the
in
vivo
situation
.

A

.

We
have
developed
a
3
-
dimensional
human
hemi
-
cornea
which
comprises
an
immortalized
epithelial
cell
line
and
keratocytes
embedded
in
a
collagen
stroma
.

In
the
present
study
,
we
have
used
MTT
reduction
of
the
whole
tissue
to
clarify
whether
the
production
of
this
complex
3
-
D
-
model
is
transferable
into
other
laboratories
and
whether
these
tissues
can
be
constructed
reproducibly
.

Our
results
demonstrate
the
reproducible
production
of
the
hemi
-
cornea
model
according
to
standard
operation
procedures
using
15
independent
batches
of
reconstructed
hemi

cornea
models
in
two
independent
laboratories
each
.

Furthermore
,
the
hemi
-
cornea
tissues
have
been
treated
with
20
chemicals
of
different
eye

irritating
potential
under
blind
conditions
to
assess
the
performance
and
limitations
of
our
test
system
comparing
three
different
prediction
models
.

The
most
suitable
prediction
model
revealed
an
overall
in
vitro
-
in
vivo
concordance
of
80
%
and
70
%
in
the
participating
laboratories
,
respectively
,
and
an
inter
-
laboratory
concordance
of
80
%
.

Sensitivity
of
the
test
was
77
%
and
specificity
was
between
57
%
and
86
%
to
discriminate
classified
from
non
-
classified
chemicals
.

We
conclude
that
additional
physiologically
relevant
endpoints
in
both
epithelium
and
stroma
have
to
be
developed
for
the
reliable
prediction
of
all
GHS
classes
of

The

Noncanonical

of

germline
apoptosis
by
the

and

signaling
pathways
.

The
insulin
/
IGF
-
1
pathway
controls
a
number
of
physiological
processes
in
the
nematode
worm
Caenorhabditis
elegans
,
including
development
,
aging
and
stress
response
.

We
previously
found
that
the
Akt
/
PKB
ortholog
AKT
-
1
dampens
the
apoptotic
response
to
genotoxic
stress
in
the
germline
by
negatively
regulating
the
p53
-
like
transcription
factor
CEP
-
1
.

Here
,
we
report
unexpected
rearrangements
to
the
insulin
/
IGF
-
1
pathway
,
whereby
the
insulin
-
like
receptor
DAF
-
2
and
3
-
phosphoinositide
-
dependent
protein
kinase
PDK
-
1
oppose
AKT
-
1
to
promote
DNA
damage
-
induced
apoptosis
.

While
DNA
damage
does
not
affect
phosphorylation
at
the
PDK
-
1
site
Thr350
/
Thr308
of
AKT
-
1
,
it
increased
phosphorylation
at
Ser517
/
Ser473
.

Although
ablation
of
daf

or
pdk

completely
suppressed
akt

1
-
dependent
apoptosis
,
the
transcriptional
activation
of
CEP

was
unaffected
,
suggesting
that
daf

2
and
pdk
-
1
act
independently
or
downstream
of
cep
-
1
and
akt
-
1
.

Ablation
of
the

the
downstream
target
of
the
insulin

daf

restored

.

In

1
mutants
have
reduced
levels
of
phospho

in
their

,
indicating
that
the
insulin

promotes

in
the

.

Ablation
of
the
Ras

gla

,
a
negative
regulator
of
mpk

,
restored
sensitivity
to

,
suggesting
that
gla

3
acts
downstream
of

In

,
the
hypersensitivity

Thus
,
insulin

selectively
engages

to
promote

Influence
of
stimulant
-
induced
hyperactivity
on
social
approach
in
the
BTBR
mouse
model
of
autism
.

Translational
research
is
needed
to
discover
pharmacological
targets
and
treatments
for
the
diagnostic
behavioral
domains
of
autism
spectrum
disorders
.

Animal
models
with
phenotypic
relevance
to
diagnostic
criteria
offer
clear
experimental
strategies
to
test
the
efficacy
and
safety
of
novel
treatments
.

Antagonists
of
mGluR5
receptors
are
in
clinical
trials
for
Fragile
X
syndrome
and
under
investigation
for
the
treatment
of
autism
spectrum
disorders
.

However
,
in
preclinical
studies
of
mGluR5
compounds
tested
in
our
laboratory
and
others
,
increased
locomotion
following
mGluR5
modulation
has
been
observed
.

Understanding
the
influence
of
general
activity
on
sociability
and
repetitive
behaviors
will
increase
the
accuracy
of
interpretations
of
positive
outcomes
measured
from
pharmacological
treatment
that
produces
locomotor
activating
or
sedating
effects
.

In
the
present
studies
,
dose
-
response
curves
for
d
-
amphetamine
(
AMPH
)
-
induced
hyperlocomotion
were
similar
in
standard
B6
mice
and
in
the
BTBR
mouse
model
of
autism
.

AMPH
produced
significant
,
robust
reductions
in
the
high
level
of
repetitive
self
-
grooming
that
characterizes
BTBR
,
and
also
reduced
the
low
baseline
grooming
in
B6
,
indicating
that
AMPH
-
induced
hyperlocomotion
competes
with
time
spent
engaged
in
self
-
grooming
.

We
then
tested
AMPH
in
B6
and
BTBR
on
the
3
-
chambered
social
approach
task
.

One
component
of
sociability
,
the
time
spent
in
the
chamber
with
the
novel
mouse
,
in
B6
mice
was
reduced
,
while
the
sniffing
time
component
of
sociability
in
BTBR
mice
was
enhanced
.

This
finding
replicated
across
multiple
cohorts
treated
with
AMPH
and
saline
vehicle
.

In
-
depth
analysis
revealed
that
AMPH
increased
the
number
and
decreased
the
duration
of
sniffing
bouts
in
BTBR
,
suggesting
BTBR
treated
with
AMPH
mostly
engaged
in
brief
sniffs
rather
than
true
social
interactions
with
the
novel
mouse
during
the
social
approach
task
.

Our
data
suggest
that
compounds
with
stimulant
properties
may
have
some
direct
benefits
on
reducing
repetitive
behaviors
in
autism
spectrum
disorders
,
particularly
in
the
subset
of
autistic
individuals
with
hyperactivity

Energy
depletion
of
bovine
mammary
epithelial
cells
activates
AMPK
and
suppresses
protein
synthesis
through
inhibition
of
mTORC1
signaling
.

The
molecular
mechanisms
by
which
cellular
energy
status
regulates
global
protein
synthesis
in
mammary
epithelial
cells
have
not
been
characterized
.

The
objective
of
this
study
was
to
examine
the
effect
of
AMP
-
activated
protein
kinase
(
AMPK
)
activation
by
2
-
deoxyglucose
on
protein
synthesis
and
the
mammalian
target
of
rapamycin
complex

(
mTORC1
)
signaling
pathway
in
bovine
mammary
epithelial
cells
.

Phosphorylation
of
AMPK
at
Thr172
increased
by

fold
within
5
min
,
and
remained
elevated
throughout
a
30
-
min
time
course
,
in
response
to
2
-
deoxyglucose
.

Global
rates
of
protein
synthesis
declined
by
78
%
of
control
values
.

The
decline
in
protein
synthesis
was
associated
with
repression
of
mTORC1
signaling
,
as
indicated
by
reduced
phosphorylation
of
ribosomal
protein
S6
kinase
1
and
eIF4E
binding
protein

Deoxyglucose
increased
phosphorylation
of
tuberous
sclerosis
complex
2
(
TSC2
)
on
AMPK
consensus
sites
but
did
not
change
the
amount
of
TSC1
bound
to
TSC2
.

Activation
of
AMPK
did
not
result
in
changes
in
the
amount
of
raptor
bound
to
mTOR
.

The
inhibitory
effects
of
AMPK
activation
on
mTORC1
signaling
were
associated
with
a
marked
increase
in
Ser792
phosphorylation
on
raptor
.

Collectively
,
the
results
suggest
that
activation
of
AMPK
represses
global
protein
synthesis
in
mammary
epithelial
cells
through
inhibition
of
mTORC1
signaling
.

Validation
of
an
in
vitro
exposure
system
for
toxicity
assessment
of
air
-
delivered
nanomaterials
.

To
overcome
the
limitations
of
in
vitro
exposure
of
submerged
lung
cells
to
nanoparticles
(
NPs
)
,
we
validated
an
integrated
low
flow
system
capable
of
generating
and
depositing
airborne
NPs
directly
onto
cells
at
an
air
-
liquid
interface
(
ALI
)
.

The
in
vitro
exposure
system
was
shown
to
provide
uniform
and
controlled
dosing
of
particles
with
70
.
3
%
efficiency
to
epithelial
cells
grown
on
transwells
.

This
system
delivered
a
continuous
airborne
exposure
of
NPs
to
lung
cells
without
loss
of
cell
viability
in
repeated
4h
exposure
periods
.

We
sequentially
exposed
cells
to
air
-
delivered
copper
(
Cu
)
NPs
in
vitro
to
compare
toxicity
results
to
our
prior
in
vivo
inhalation
studies
.

The
evaluation
of
cellular
dosimetry
indicated
that
a
large
amount
of
Cu
was
taken
up
,
dissolved
and
released
into
the
basolateral
medium
(
62
%
of
total
mass
)
.

Exposure
to
Cu
NPs
decreased
cell
viability
to
73
%
(
p
<
0
.
01
)
and
significantly
(
p
<
0
.
05
)
elevated
levels
of
lactate
dehydrogenase
,
intracellular
reactive
oxygen
species
and
interleukin
-
8
that
mirrored
our
findings
from
subacute
in
vivo
inhalation
studies
in
mice
.

Our
results
show
that
this
exposure
system
is
useful
for
screening
of
NP
toxicity
in
a
manner
that
represents
cellular
responses
of
the
pulmonary
epithelium
in

.

Leukotriene
D4
induces
cognitive
impairment
through
enhancement
of
CysLT₁
R
-
mediated
amyloid
-
β
generation
in
mice
.

Amyloid
plaques
in
the
extracellular
parenchyma
mainly
consist
of
amyloid
-
β
peptides
(
Aβ
)
,
one
of
the
pathological
hallmarks
in
Alzheimer
'
s
disease
(
AD
)
.

In
the
present
study
,
we
examined
neuroinflammation
,
amyloidogenesis
,
and
memory
performance
following
intracerebral
infusions
of
leukotriene
D4
(
LTD4
)
in
mice
.

The
results
demonstrated
that
intracerebral
infusions
of
LTD4
(
1
ng
/
mouse
)
produced
memory
impairment
as
determined
by
Morris
water
maze
test
and
Y
-
maze
test
in
mice
,
and
caused
the
accumulation
of
Aβ1
-
40
and
Aβ1
-
42
in
the
hippocampus
and
cortex
through
increased
activity
of
β
-
and
γ
-
secretases
accompanied
with
increased
expression
of
amyloid
precursor
protein
(
APP
)
.

LTD4
also
induced
expression
of
cysteinyl
leukotriene
receptor
1
(
CysLT
(
1
)
R
)
and
NF
-
κB
p65
in
the
hippocampus
and
cortex
.

Pretreatment
with
pranlukast
(

5
ng

mouse
,
intracerebroventricularly
)
,
a
CysLT
(
1
)
R
antagonist
,
blocked
LTD4
-
induced
amyloidogenesis
,
memory
deficits
.

Pranlukast
(
0

6
μM
)
also
prevented
LTD4
(
20
nM
)
-
induced
amyloidogenesis
in
the
cultured
neurons
in

.

Moreover
,
LTD4
-
induced
increases
in
CysLT
(
1
)
R
and
NF
-
κB
p65
in
the
brain
were
also
attenuated
by
pranlukast
.

These
results
suggest
that
LTD4
increases
Aβ
peptide
burden
via
activation
of
CysLT
(
1
)
R
,
which
further
affects
APP
levels
and
activity
of
β
-
and
γ
-
secretases
via
the
NF
-
κB
pathway
.

Our
findings
identify
CysLT
(
1
)
R
signaling
as
a
novel
proinflammatory
and
proamyloidogenic
pathway
,
and
suggest
a
rationale
for
development
of
therapeutics
targeting
the
CysLT
(
1
)
R
in
neuroinflammatory
diseases
such
as
AD
.

Swim

improves
the
impaired
insulin
receptor
tyrosine
phosphorylation
in
pancreatic

.

The
goal
of
the
present
study
was
to
investigate
changes
on
glucose
homoeostasis
and
of
the
insulin

(
IR
)
and

in

Swim

was
used
to
evaluate
whether

are
involved
with
the
insulin

observed
in
this

The
results
showed
that

was
reduced
by
42

Current

shows
that
the

the

Pioglitazone
protects
against
cisplatin
induced
nephrotoxicity
in
rats
and
potentiates
its
anticancer
activity
against
human
renal
adenocarcinoma
cell
lines
.

Cisplatin
-
induced
nephrotoxicity
is
a
serious
problem
that
limits
its
use
in
cancer
treatment
.

The
present
study
aimed
to
investigate
the
renal
protective
capacity
of
pioglitazone
to
reduce
the
cisplatin
-
induced
nephrotoxicity
.

The
underlying
suggested
mechanism
(
s
)
and
whether
this
nephroprotective
effect
(
if
any
)
interferes
with
the
cytotoxic
effect
of
cisplatin
on
cancer
cells
were
also
investigated
.

Pioglitazone
,
Bisphenol
A
diglycidyl
ether
,
BADGE
,
IP
injected
(
Peroxisome
proliferator
-
activated
receptor
gamma
(
PPAR

)
antagonist
)
,
or
their
combination
were
administered
to
rats
one
hour
before
cisplatin
injection
.

Moreover
,
their
effects
on
the
cell
viability
of
human
renal
adenocarcinoma
cell
models
(
ACHN
)
were
studied
.

The
obtained
results
showed
that
pioglitazone
improved
the
renal
function
,
structural
changes
,
renal
malondialdehyde
(
MDA
)
,

)
genes
expression
in
cisplatin
injected
rats
.

It
increased
both
renal
reduced
glutathione
(
GSH
)
content
and
PPAR
-
γ
gene
expression
.

In
contrast
to
the
data
obtained
by
prior
administration
of
BADGE
.

Pioglitazone
also
potentiated
the
cytotoxic
effect
of
cisplatin
on
human
renal
adenocarcinoma
cells
and
this
effect
was
abolished
by
BADGE
co
administration
.

In
conclusion
,
these
results
suggested
that
pioglitazone
protected
against
cisplatin
-
induced
nephrotoxicity
through
its
interaction
with
PPAR
-
γ
receptors
and
antioxidant
effects
.

Furthermore
,
pioglitazone
did
not
interfere
but
rather
potentiated
the
cytotoxic
effects
of
cisplatin
on
human
renal
adenocarcinoma
cells
.

Can

An
immunological
perspective
on
the
adverse
drug
effects
of
aminobisphosphonate
therapy
.

Nitrogen
-
bisphosphonates
(
n

)
,
often
referred
to
as
aminobisphosphonates
,
are
the
most
commonly
prescribed
drugs
for
the
treatment
of
disorders
of
bone
fragility
.

However
,
long
-
term
continuous
treatment
predisposes
certain
individuals
to
serious
rare
side
effects
,
such
as
bisphosphonate
-
associated
osteonecrosis
of
the
jaw
(
BAONJ
)
.

n
-
BP
use
is
known
to
unintentionally
activate
a
subset
of
innate
T
cells
called
Vγ9Vδ2
T
cells
,
but
the
consequence
of
this
chronic
immune
stimulation
has
remained
unexplored
.

The
primary
objectives
of
this
study
were
to
1
)
determine
the
fate
of
Vγ9Vδ2
T
cells
in
osteoporotic
patients
on

as
a

evaluate
the
proportion
of

in
patients
who
had
recently
experienced

.

We
found
there
is
a
notable
loss
of
Vγ9Vδ2

over
time
in

patients
on

(

;
no

.

Importantly
,
the
observed
negative
effect
on
Vγ9Vδ2
T
cells
coincides
with
the
reported
route
of
administration
and
timing
of
the
rare
occurrence
of

.

Patients
(

this
was
the

in

assessed
.

All
BAONJ
cases
had
an
underlying
condition
that
further
contributed
to
impaired
immunity
.

We
propose
Vγ9Vδ2
T
cells
show
a
strong
potential
to
serve
as
harbingers
of
possible
adverse
immune
effects
of
n
-
BP
therapy
,
particularly
in
those
patients
already
having
a
compromised
immune
system
as
they
may
be
most
vulnerable
to
the
development
of
conditions
such
as
BAONJ
.

Snake
venom
metalloproteinases
.

Recent
proteomic
analyses
of
snake
venoms
show
that
metalloproteinases
represent
major
components
in
most
of
the
Crotalid
and
Viperid
venoms
.

In
this
chapter
we
discuss
the
multiple
activities
of
the
SVMPs
.

In
addition
to
hemorrhagic
activity
,
members
of
the
SVMP
family
also
have
fibrin
(
ogen
)
olytic
activity
,
act
as
prothrombin
activators
,
activate
blood
coagulation
factor
X
,
possess
apoptotic
activity
,
inhibit
platelet
aggregation
,
are
pro
-
inflammatory
and
inactivate
blood
serine
proteinase
inhibitors
.

Clearly
the
SVMPs
have
multiple
functions
in
addition
to
their
well
-
known
hemorrhagic
activity
.

The
realization
that
there
are
structural
variations
in
the
SVMPs
and
the
early
studies
that
led
to
their
classification
represents
an
important
event
in
our
understanding
of
the
structural
forms
of
the
SVMPs
.

The
SVMPs
were
subdivided
into
the
P
-
I
,
P
-
II
and
P
-
III
protein
classes
.

The
noticeable
characteristic
that
distinguished
the
different
classes
was
their
size
(
molecular
weight
)
differences
and
domain
structure
:
Class
I
(
P
-
I
)
,
the
small
SVMPs
,
have
molecular
masses
of
20
-
30
kDa
,
contain
only
a
pro
domain
and
the
proteinase
domain
;
Class
II
(
P
-
II
)
,
the
medium
size
SVMPs
,
molecular
masses
of
30
-
60
kDa
,
contain
the
pro
domain
,
proteinase
domain
and
disintegrin
domain
;
Class
III
(
P
-
III
)
,
the
large
SVMPs
,
have
molecular
masses
of
60
-
100
kDa
,
contain
pro
,
proteinase
,
disintegrin
-
like
and
cysteine
-
rich
domain
structure
.

Another
significant
advance
in
the
SVMP
field
was
the
characterization
of
the
crystal
structure
of
the
first
P
-
I
class
SVMP
.

The
structures
of
other
P
-
I
SVMPs
soon
followed
and
the
structures
of
P
-
III
SVMPs
have
also
been
determined
.

The
active
site
of
the
metalloproteinase
domain
has
a
consensus
HEXXHXXGXXHD
sequence
and
a
Met
-
turn
.

The
"
Met
-
turn
"
structure
contains
a
conserved
Met
residue
that
forms
a
hydrophobic
basement
for
the
three
zinc
-
binding
histidines
in
the
consensus
sequence
.

Wogonoside
induces
autophagy
in
MDA
-
MB
-
231
cells
by
regulating
MAPK
-
mTOR
pathway
.

Previous
studies
have
demonstrated
that
wogonoside
,
a
bioactive
flavonoid
extracted
from
the
root
of
Scutellaria
baicalensis
Gerogi
,
has
anti
-
inflammatory
and
anti
-
angiogenic
activities
.

In
this
study
,
we
evaluated
wogonoside
-
induced
autophagy
on
human
breast
MDA
-
MB
-
231
cells
.

We
report
that
wogonoside
triggered
the
formation
of
microtubule
-
associated
protein
-
light
chain
3
(
MAP
-
LC3
)
positive
autophagosomes
and
the
accumulation
of
acidic
vesicular
and
autolysosomes
in
MDA
-
MB
-
231
cells
.

In
addition
,
cells
treated
by
wogonoside
developed
autophagosome
-
like
characteristics
,
including
single
and
double
membrane
vacuoles
containing
intact
and
degraded
cellular
debris
.

The
results
showed
that
wogonoside
promotes
the
expression
of
LC3
-
II
and
Beclin
-
1
.

Furthermore
,
wogonoside
inhibited
cell
growth
of
MDA
-
MB
-
231
cells
in
a
concentration
-
and
time
-
dependent
manner
,
which
was
associated
with
wogonoside
-
induced
autophagy
.

Wogonoside
also
suppressed
the
activation
of
mammalian
target
of
rapamycin
(
mTOR
)
and
p70
-
S6
kinase
(
p70S6K
)
by
regulating
the
expression
of
the
extracellular
signal
-
regulated
kinase
(
ERK1
/
2
)
and
p38
involved
mitogen
-
activated
protein
kinase
(
MAPK
)
signaling
pathway
.

Taken
together
,
these
results
suggest
that
wogonoside
partially
inhibits
MDA
-
MB
-
231
cell
growth
by
inducing
autophagy
through
the
MAPK
-
mTOR
pathway
and
may
be
a
promising
anti
-
tumor
agent
.

Effect
of
ifenprodil
on
GluN1
/
GluN2B
N
-
methyl
-
D
-
aspartate
receptor
gating
.

Ifenprodil
is
an
allosteric
inhibitor
of
GluN1
/
GluN2B
N
-
methyl
-
D
-
aspartate
receptors
.

Despite
its
widespread
use
as
a
prototype
for
drug
development
and
a
subtype
-
selective
tool
for
physiologic
experiments
,
its
precise
effect
on
GluN1
/
GluN2B
gating
is
yet
to
be
fully
understood
.

Interestingly
,
recent
crystallographic
evidence
identified
that
ifenprodil
,
unlike
zinc
,
binds
at
the
interface
of
the
GluN1
/
GluN2B
amino
terminal
domain
dimer
by
an
induced
-
fit
mechanism
.

To
delineate
the
effect
of
this
unique
binding
on
GluN1
/
GluN2B
receptor
gating
,
we
recorded
steady
-
state
currents
from
cell
-
attached
and
outside
-
out
patches
.

At
pH
7
.
9
in
cell
-
attached
patches
,
ifenprodil
increased
the
occupancy
of
the
long
-
lived
shut
conformations
,
thereby
reducing
the
open
probability
of
the
receptor
with
no
change
in
the
mean
open
time
.

In
addition
,
ifenprodil
selectively
affected
the
area
of
shut

constants
,
but
not
the
time
constants
themselves
.

Kinetic
analyses
suggested
that
ifenprodil
prevents
the
transition
of
the
receptor
to
an
open
state
and
increases
its
dwell
time
in
an
intrinsically
occurring
closed
conformation
or
desensitized
state
.

We
found
distinct
differences
in
the
action
of
ifenprodil
at
GluN1
/
GluN2B
in
comparison
with
previous
studies
on
the
effect
of
zinc
on
GluN1
/
GluN2A
gating
,
which
may
arise
due
to
their
unique
binding
sites
.

Our
data
also
uncover
the
potential
pH
-
dependent
action
of
ifenprodil
on
gating
.

At
a
low
pH
(
pH
7
.
4
)
,
but
not
pH
7
.
9
,
ifenprodil
reduces
the
mean
open
time
of
GluN1
/
GluN2B
receptors
,
which
may
be
responsible
for
its
usefulness
as
a
context
-
dependent
inhibitor
in
conditions
like
ischemia
and
stroke
,
when
the
pH
of
the
extracellular
milieu
becomes
acidic

SB365
,
Pulsatilla
saponin
D
suppresses
the
proliferation
of
human
colon
cancer
cells
and
induces
apoptosis
by
modulating
the
AKT
/
mTOR
signalling
pathway
.

Pulsatilla
koreana
has
been
used
as
a
traditional
medicine
for
the
treatment
of
several
diseases
.

The
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
determine
if
SB365
,
Pulsatilla
saponin
D
isolated
from
the
root
of
P
.
koreana
inhibits
the
progression
of
colon
cancer
.

We
found
that
SB365
strongly
suppressed
the
growth
and
proliferation
of
colon
cancer
cells
and
induced
their
apoptosis
.

Also
,
SB365
showed
anti
-
angiogenic
activity
by
decreasing
the
expression
of
HIF
-
1α
and
VEGF
.

These
results
were
confirmed
by
an
in
vivo
study
showing
that
SB365
significantly
inhibited
tumor
growth
by
the
induction
of
apoptosis
and
inhibition
of
angiogenesis
with
stronger
anticancer
activity
than
5
-
FU
.

When
further
examined
for
its
anticancer
mechanism
,
SB365
effectively
suppressed
the
AKT
/
mTOR
pathway
both
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
.

Taken
together
,
our
study
demonstrated
that
SB365
inhibits
the
AKT
/
mTOR
pathway
,
leading
to
the
suppression
of
tumor
growth
and
angiogenesis
together
with
induction
of
apoptosis
.

Therefore
,
SB365
is
a
good
candidate
as
a
natural
product
for
use
in
the
treatment
of
colon
cancer
.

Diuretic

In

effects
of
cannabinoid

are
often
assessed
using
four
well

established
measures
:
locomotor
activity
,
hypothermia
,
cataleptic
-
like
effects
,
and
analgesia
.

The
present
studies
demonstrate
that
doses
of
CB
agonists
that
produce
these
effects
also
reliably
increase
diuresis
.

Diuretic
effects
of
several
CB

were
measured
in
female

over
2
hours
immediately
after

Novel
assays
for
detection
of
urinary
KIM

in
mouse
models
of
kidney

.

Kidney

(
KIM

)
has
been
qualified
by
the
Food
and
Drug
Administration
and
European
Medicines
Agency
as
a
urinary

to
monitor
preclinical

basis
for
the
translation
of

-
in
human

.

Although
mouse
models
are
widely
employed
in
preclinical
studies
,
few
urinary
biomarker
studies
have
been
performed
in
mice
due
to
limited
urine
availability
and
lack
of
sensitive
assays
.

Here
,
we
report
the
development
and
validation
of
two
different
assays
for
quantitative
assessment
of
mouse
urinary

compare
the

relative
to

in

.

A
sensitive
,
reproducible
,
and

ELISA
was
established
,
which
requires
only
10
μl

for

determination
with
an
assay
range
of
12

The

is
a

,
which
has
an

and
provides

uKIM

levels
increased
with

administration
.

After
only
10

followed
by

levels
were
significantly
upregulated
by
greater
than

Inhibition
of
neurite
outgrowth
and
alteration
of
cytoskeletal
gene
expression
by
sodium
arsenite
.

Arsenic
compounds
that
are
often
found
in
drinking
water
increase
the
risk
of
developmental
brain
disorders
.

In
this
study
,
we
performed
live
imaging
analyses
of
Neuro
-
2a
cells
expressing
SCAT3
,
a
caspase
-
3
cleavage
peptide
sequence
linking
two
fluorescent
proteins
;
enhanced
cyan
fluorescence
protein
(
ECFP
)
and
Venus
,
to
determine
whether
sodium
arsenite
(
NaAsO
(
2
)
;
0
,
1
,
5
,
or
10
μM
)
affects
both
neurite
outgrowth
and
/
or
induces
apoptosis
with
the
same
doses
and
in
the
same
cell
cultures
.

We
observed
that
the
area
ratio
of
neurite
to
cell
body
in
SCAT3
-
expressing
cells
was
significantly
reduced
by
5
and
10
μM
NaAsO
(
2
)
,
but
not
by
1
μM
,
although
the
emission
ratio
of
ECFP
to
Venus
,
an
endpoint
of
caspase
-
3
activity
,
was
not
changed
.

However
,
cytological
assay
using
apoptotic
and
necrotic
markers
resulted
in
that
apoptosis
,
but
not
necrosis
,
was
significantly
induced
in
Neuro
-
2a
cells
when
NaAsO
(
2
)
exposure
continued
after
the
significant
effects
of
NaAsO
(
2
)
on
neurite
outgrowth
were
found
by
live
imaging
.

These
results
suggested
that
neurite
outgrowth
was
suppressed
by
NaAsO
(
2
)
prior
to
NaAsO
(
2
)
-
induced
apoptosis
.

Next
,
we
examined
the
effects
of
NaAsO
(
2
)
on
cytoskeletal
gene
expression
in
Neuro
-
2a
cells
.

NaAsO
(
2
)
increased
the
mRNA
levels
of
the
light
and
medium
subunits
of
neurofilament
and
decreased
the
mRNA
levels
of
tau
and
tubulin
in
a
dose
-
dependent
manner
;
no
significant
effect
was
found
in
the
mRNA
levels
of
the
heavy
subunit
of
neurofilament
,
microtubule
-
associated
protein
2
,
or
actin
.

The
changes
in
cytoskeletal
gene
expression
are
likely
responsible
for
the
inhibitory
effects
of
NaAsO
(
2
)
on
neurite
outgrowth
.

Resveratrol
attenuates
hepatotoxicity
of
rats
exposed
to
arsenic
trioxide
.

Arsenic
trioxide
(
As
(
2
)
O
(
3
)
)
is
an
environmental
pollutant
and
potent
toxicant
to
humans
.

However
,
it
also
shows
substantial
anti
-
cancer
activity
in
individuals
with
acute
promyelocytic
leukemia
(
APL
)
.

Unfortunately
,
As
(
2
)
O
(
3
)
-
treated
leukemia
patients
suffer
hepatotoxicity
.

Resveratrol
has
been
demonstrated
to
have
efficient
antioxidant
and
antineoplastic
activities
.

The
study
that
how
As
(
2
)
O
(
3
)
in
combination
with
resveratrol
affects
hepatotoxicity
and
arsenic
accumulation
in
the
liver
is
lacking
,
and
the
present
study
tackles
this
question
.

Wistar
rats
were
injected
with
3mg
/
kg
As
(
2
)
O
(
3
)
on
alternate
days
;
resveratrol
(
8mg
/
kg
)
was
administered
1h
before
As
(
2
)
O
(
3
)
.

Rats
were
killed
on
the
8th
day
to
determine
histological
liver
damage
,
the
antioxidant
enzymes
in
serum
,
the
ratio
of
reduced
glutathione
(
GSH
)
to
oxidized
glutathione
(
GSSG
)
,
and
arsenic
accumulation
in
the
liver
.

In
the
resveratrol
+
As
(
2
)
O
(
3
)
group
,
activities
of
superoxide
dismutase
,
catalase
in
serum
and
GSH
/
GSSG
were
significantly
increased
,
histopathological
effects
were
reduced
,
and
arsenic
accumulation
markedly
decreased
in
the
liver
,
compared
with
the
As
(
2
)
O
(
3
)
-
treated
group
.

Thus
,
resveratrol
attenuated
As
(
2
)
O
(
3
)
-
induced
hepatotoxicity
by
decreasing
oxidative
stress
and
arsenic
accumulation
in
the
liver
.

These
data
suggest
that
use
of
resveratrol
as
post
-
remission
therapy
of
APL
and
adjunctive
therapy
in
patients
with
chronic
exposure
to
arsenic
may
decrease
arsenic
hepatotoxicity
.

DNA
methylation
and
histone
modification
profiles
of
mouse
organic
anion
transporting
polypeptides
.

Organic
anion
transporting
polypeptides
(
rodents
,
Oatps
;
human
,
OATPs
)
are
primarily
involved
in
the
transmembrane
transportation
of
a
wide
range
of
endogenous
and
exogenous
compounds
.

Multiple
mouse
Oatp1
isoforms
are
closely
located
on
chromosome
6
,
where
each
isoform
shows
distinct
tissue
distribution
;
Oatp1b2
,
Oatp1a6
,
and
Oatp1c1
are
expressed
exclusively
in
the
liver
,
kidney
,
and
cerebrum
,
respectively
;
Oatp1a1
in
the
liver
and
kidney
;
and
Oatp1a4
in
the
liver
and
cerebrum
.

We
have
identified
tissue
-
dependent
differentially
methylated
region
(
T
-
DMR
)
around
the
transcriptional
start
site
(
TSS
)
of
Oatp1b2
,
which
correlates
with
its
liver
-
specific
expression
.

Bisulfite
sequencing
also
demonstrated
the
presence
of
T
-
DMRs
around
the
TSS
in
other
Oatp1
genes
:
CpG
dinucleotides
at
+
149
relative
to
the
TSS
for
Oatp1c1
;
-
48
,
+
101
,
and
+
356
for
Oatp1a4
;
-
572
and
-
550
for
Oatp1a1
;
and
-
122
and
+
216
for
Oatp1a6
were
differentially
methylated
among
the
liver
,
kidney
,
and
cerebrum
.

These
methylation
profiles
were
largely
consistent
with
the
tissue
distribution
of
Oatp1
mRNAs
.

Chromatin
immunoprecipitation
assay
revealed
that
the
mRNA
expression
of
Oatp1
genes
was
accompanied
by
acetylated
histone
H3
.

Human
OATP1B1
and
OATP1B3
are
located
on
chromosome
12p12
in
the
OATP1
cluster
;
both
show
predominant
expression
in
the
liver
.

These
genes
also
contained
T
-
DMRs
that
were
hypomethylated
in
the
liver
,
compared
with
kidney
cortex
:
-
511
,
-
411
,
and
+
92
relative
to
the
TSS
for
OATP1B1
and
-
331
,
+
70
,
and
+
73
for
OATP1B3
.

These
results
suggest
that
the
difference
in
epigenetic
profiles
comprising
DNA
methylation
and
histone
acetylation
determines
the
distinct
tissue
distribution
of
Oatp
/
OATP
mRNAs
.

Tin
(

(
DBDCT
)
,
an
antitumor
agent
with
high
activity
and
obvious
neurotoxicity
was
chosen
as
a
typical
diorganotin
(
IV
)
compound
to
investigate
its
neurotoxic
mechanism
using
PC12
cells
and
comprehensive
methods
.

Treatment
with
DBDCT
resulted
in
a
dose
-
and
time
-
dependent
growth
inhibition
of
PC12
cells
.

The
changes
in
cell
morphology
were
observed
using
light
microscopy
,
fluorescence
microscopy
and
transmission
electron
microscopy
.

PC12
cell
apoptosis
induced
by
DBDCT
was
confirmed
by
annexin
V
/
propidium
iodide
staining
,
and
characterized
by
cleavage
of
caspase
-
9
and
caspase
-
3
proteins
.

DBDCT
induced
the
release
of
cytochrome
c
from
the
mitochondria
to
the
cytosol
and
the
generation
of
reactive
oxygen
species
.

DBDCT
up
-
regulated
the
expression
of
Bax
,
down
-
regulated
the
expression
of
Bcl
-
2
,
and
significantly
increased
the
ratio
of
Bax
/
Bcl
-
2
.

DBDCT
also
caused
the
phosphorylation
of
JNK
and
p38
(
MAPK
)
.

In
rats
exposed
to
DBDCT
,
apoptosis
was
also
observed
in
brain
,
as
shown
by
the
detection
of
cleaved
caspase
-
9
and
caspase

proteins
and
increased
TUNEL
positive
staining
.

In
conclusion
,
the
results
demonstrated
that
DBDCT
caused
the
neurotoxicity
by
inducing
apoptosis
via

pathway
.

Interactions
between
CYP2E1
and
CYP2B4
:
effects
on
affinity
for
NADPH
-
cytochrome
P450
reductase
and
substrate
metabolism
.

Studies
in
microsomal
and
reconstituted
systems
have
shown
that
the
presence
of
one
cytochrome
P450
isoform
can
significantly
influence
the
catalytic
activity
of
another
isoform
.

In
this
study
,
we
assessed
whether
CYP2E1
could
influence
the
catalytic
activity
of
CYP2B4
under
steady
-
state
turnover
conditions
.

The
results
show
that
CYP2E1
inhibits
CYP2B4
-
mediated
metabolism
of
benzphetamine
(
BNZ
)
with
a
K
(
i
)
of
0
.
04
µM
.

However
,
CYP2B4
is
not
an
inhibitor
of
CYP2E1
-
mediated
p
-
nitrophenol
hydroxylation
.

When
these
inhibition
studies
were
performed
with
the
artificial
oxidant
tert
-
butyl
hydroperoxide
,
CYP2E1
did
not
significantly
inhibit
CYP2B4
activity
.

Determinations
of
the
apparent
K
(
M
)
and
k
(
cat
)
of
CYP2B4
for
CPR
in
the
presence
of
increasing
concentrations
of
CYP2E1
revealed
a
mixed
inhibition
of
CYP2B4
by
CYP2E1
.

At
low
concentrations
of
CYP2E1
,
the
apparent
K
(
M
)
of
CYP2B4
for
CPR
increased
up
to
23
-
fold
with
virtually
no
change
in
the
k
(
cat
)
for
the
reaction
,
however
,
at
higher
concentrations
of
CYP2E1
,
the
apparent
K
(
M
)
of
CYP2B4
for
CPR
decreased
to
levels
similar
to
those
observed
in
the
absence
of
CYP2E1
and
the
k
(
cat
)
also
decreased
by
11
-
fold
.

Additionally
,
CYP2E1
increased
the
apparent
K
(
M
)
of
CYP2B4
for
BNZ
by
8
-
fold
and
the
apparent
K
(
M
)
did
not
decrease
to
its
original
value
when
saturating
concentrations
of
CPR
were
used
.

While
the
individual
apparent
K
(
M
)
values
of
CYP2B4
and
CYP2E1
for
CPR
are
similar
,
the
apparent
K
(
M
)
of
CYP2E1
for
CPR
in
the
presence
of
CYP2B4
decreased
significantly
,
thus
suggesting
that
CYP2B4
enhances
the
affinity
of
CYP2E1
for
CPR
and
this
may
allow
CYP2E1
to
out
-
compete
CYP2B4
for
CPR
.

Adverse
outcome
pathways
during
zebrafish
embryogenesis
:
a
case
study
with
paraoxon
.

Using
paraoxon
as
a
reference
acetylcholinesterase
(
AChE
)
inhibitor
,
the
objective
of
this
study
was
to
develop
an
adverse
outcome
pathway
(
AOP
)
that
provided
quantitative
linkages
across
levels
of
biological
organization
during
zebrafish
embryogenesis
.

Within
normal
zebrafish
embryos
,
we
first
demonstrated
that
ache
transcripts
and
AChE
activity
increased
in
a
stage
-
dependent
manner
following
segmentation
.

We
then
showed
that
static
exposure
of
embryos
to
paraoxon
(
31
.
2
-
500
nM
)
from
5
to
96
hpf
resulted
in
significant
stage
-
and
concentration
-
dependent
AChE
inhibition
,
albeit
these
effects
were
fully
reversible
within
48
h
following
transfer
to
clean
water
.

However
,
even
in
the
presence
of
significant
AChE
inhibition
,
exposure
to
non
-
teratogenic
paraoxon
concentrations
(
≤
250
nM
)
did
not
adversely
impact
secondary
motoneuron
development
at
96
hpf
.

Therefore
,
we
investigated
the
potential
effects
of
paraoxon
exposure
on
spontaneous
tail
contractions
at
26
hpf
-
an
early
locomotor
behavior
that
results
from
innervation
of
primary
(
not
secondary
)
motoneuron
axons
to
target
axial
muscles
.

Based
on
these
studies
,
the
frequency
of
spontaneous
tail
contractions
at
26
hpf
-
a
developmental
stage
with
minimal
AChE
expression
and
activity
-
was
significantly
higher
following
exposure
to
paraoxon
concentrations
as
low
as
31
.
2
nM
.

Overall
,
our
data
suggest
that
(
1
)
normal
AChE
activity
is
not
required
for
secondary
motoneuron
development
and
(
2
)
spontaneous
tail
contractions
at
26
hpf
are
sensitive
to
paraoxon
exposure
,
an
effect
that
may
be
independent
of
AChE
inhibition
.

Using
a
well
-
studied
reference
chemical
,
this
study
highlights
the
potential
challenges
in
developing
quantitative
AOPs
to
support
chemical
screening
and
prioritization
strategies
.

TLR4
antagonist
reduces
early
-
stage
atherosclerosis
in
diabetic
apolipoprotein
E
-
deficient
mice
.

Although
it
has
been
reported
that
deficiency
of
toll
-
like
receptor
4
(
TLR4
)
is
associated
with
reduced
atherosclerosis
in
atherosclerosis
-
prone
mice
and
attenuated
pro
-
inflammatory
state
in
diabetic
mice
,
it
remains
undetermined
whether
treatment
with
a
TLR4
antagonist
reduces
atherosclerosis
in
nondiabetic
or
diabetic
mice
that
have
TLR4
expression
.

In
this
study
,
we
determined
the
effect
of
Rhodobacter
sphaeroides
lipopolysaccharide
(
Rs
-
LPS
)
,
an
established
TLR4
antagonist
,
on
early
-
stage
atherosclerosis
in
nondiabetic
and
streptozotocin
-
induced
diabetic
apolipoprotein
E
-
deficient
(
Apoe
(
-

)
)
mice
.

Analysis
of
atherosclerotic
lesions
of
both
en
face
aortas
and
cross
sections
of
aortic
roots
showed
that
administration
of
Rs
-
LPS
in
14
-
week
-
old
diabetic
Apoe
(
-
/
-
)
mice
for
10
weeks
significantly
reduced
atherosclerotic
lesions
.

Although
atherosclerotic
lesions
in
nondiabetic
Apoe
(
-
/
-
)
mice
appeared
to
be
decreased
by
Rs
-
LPS
treatment
,
the
difference
was
not
statistically
significant
.

Metabolic
study
showed
that
Rs
-
LPS
significantly
lowered
serum
levels
of
cholesterol
and
triglycerides
in
nondiabetic
mice
but
not
in
diabetic
mice
.

Furthermore
,
immunohistochemistry
studies
showed
that
Rs
-
LPS
inhibited
the
expression
of
interleukin
6
and
matrix
metalloproteinase
-
9
and
reduced
the
content
of
monocytes
and
macrophages
in
atherosclerotic
plaques
.

Taken
together
,
this
study
demonstrated
for
the
first
time
that
TLR4
antagonist
inhibited
vascular
inflammation
and
atherogenesis
in
diabetic
Apoe
(
-
/

)
mice
and
lowered
serum
cholesterol
and
triglyceride
levels
in
nondiabetic
Apoe
(

mice
.

Parental
exposure
to
natural
mixtures
of
POPs
reduced
embryo
production
and
altered
gene
transcription
in
zebrafish
embryos
.

Determination
of
toxicity
of
complex
mixtures
has
been
proposed
to
be
one
of
the
most
important
challenges
for
modern
toxicology
.

In
this
study
we
performed
genome
wide
transcriptome
profiling
to
assess
potential
toxicant
induced
changes
in
gene
regulation
in
zebrafish
embryos
following
parental
exposure
to
two
natural
mixtures
of
persistent
organic
pollutants
(
POPs
)
.

The
mixtures
used
were
extracted
from
burbot
(
Lota
lota
)
liver
originating
from
two
lakes
(
Lake
Mjøsa
and
Lake
Losna
)
belonging
to
the
same
freshwater
system
in
Norway
.

The
dominating
groups
of
contaminants
were
polybrominated
diphenyl
ethers
(
PBDEs
)
,
polychlorinated
biphenyls
(
PCBs
)
and
dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane
metabolites
(
DDTs
)
.

Because
both
mixtures
used
in
the
present
study
induced
similar
effects
,
it
is
likely
that
the
same
toxicants
are
involved
.

The
Mjøsa
mixture
contains
high
levels
of
PBDEs
while
this
group
of
pollutants
is
low
in
the
Losna
mixture
.

However
,
both
mixtures
contain
substantial
concentrations
of
PCB
and
DDT
suggesting
these
contaminants
as
the
predominant
contributors
to
the
toxicity
observed
.

The
observed
effects
included
phenotypic
traits
,
like
embryo
production
and
survival
,
and
gene
transcription
changes
corresponding
with
disease
and
biological
functions
such
as
cancer
,
reproductive
system
disease
,
cardiovascular
disease
,
lipid
and
protein
metabolism
,
small
molecule
biochemistry
and
cell
cycle
.

The
changes
in
gene
transcription
included
genes
regulated
by
HNF4A
,
insulin
,
LH
,
FSH
and
NF
-
κB
which
are
known
to
be
central
regulators
of
endocrine
signaling
,
metabolism
,
metabolic
homeostasis
,
immune
functions
,
cancer
development
and
reproduction
.

The
results
suggest
that
relative
low
concentrations
of
the
natural
mixtures
of
POPs
used
in
the
present
study
might
pose
a
threat
to
wild
freshwater
fish
living
in
the
lakes
from
which
the
POPs
mixtures
originated
.

Artemisinic
acid
inhibits
melanogenesis
through
downregulation
of
C

reductase
gene
.

Cholesterol
is
associated
with
the
regulation
of
melanogenesis
which
is
the
major
physiological
defense
against
solar
irradiation
.

The
present
study
was
designed
to
determine
the
effects
of
artemisinic
acid
on
melanogenesis
and
its
mechanisms
of
action
in
human
epidermal
melanocytes
.

In
this
study
,
we
found
that
artemisinic
acid
inhibited
melanin
content
.

The
mRNA
levels
of
microphthalmia
-
associated
transcription
factor
(
MITF
)
and
its
downstream
genes
tyrosinase
,
tyrosinase
-
related
protein
(
TRP
)
-
1
,
and
TRP
-
2
were
reduced
by
artemisinic
acid
treatment
.

Additionally
,
the
mRNA
levels
of
melanogenesis
-
related
genes
(
c
-
KIT
,
stem
cell
factor
(
SCF
)
,
and
macrophage
migration
inhibitory
factor
(
MIF
)
)
were
down
-
regulated
by
artemisinic
acid
.

Furthermore
,
cAMP
production
and
protein
kinase
A
(
PKA
)
activity
were
suppressed
by
artemisinic
acid
.

Moreover
,
attempts
to
elucidate
a
possible
mechanism
underlying
the
artemisinic
acid
-
mediated
effects
revealed
that
artemisinic
acid
regulated
melanogenesis
by
inhibiting
cholesterol
synthesis
through
downregulation
of
the
hydroxymethylglutaryl
CoA
(
HMG
CoA
)
reductase
gene
,
which
was
mediated
through
reduced
expression
of
the
CCAAT
/
enhancer
-
binding
protein
(
C
/
EBP
)
α
gene
.

Taken
together
,
these
findings
indicate
that
the
inhibition
of
melanogenesis
by
artemisinic
acid
occurs
through
reduced
expression
of
the
HMG
CoA
reductase
gene
,
which
is
mediated
by
C
/
EBP
α
inhibition
and
suggest
that
artemisinic
acid
may
be
useful
as
a
hyperpigmentation
inhibitor
.

In

genotoxicity
of
methyleugenol
in

Methyleugenol
(
MEG
)
,
which
is
commonly
used
as
a
fragrance
and
flavoring
agent
,
has
been
shown
to
induce
hepatocellular

in
rodents
.

However
,
the
role
of
genotoxicity
as
a
possible
mechanism
of
action
is
not
fully
understood
even
though
the
DNA

has
been
identified
.

In
this

,
a

was
used
to
clarify
whether
genotoxic
mechanisms
are
involved
in
MEG

Histone
deacetylase
3
is
required
for
maintenance
of
bone
mass
during
aging
.

Histone
deacetylase
3
(
Hdac3
)
is
a
nuclear
enzyme
that
removes
acetyl
groups
from
lysine
residues
in
histones
and
other
proteins
to
epigenetically
regulate
gene
expression
.

Hdac3
interacts
with
bone
-
related
transcription
factors
and
co
-
factors
such
as
Runx2
and
Zfp521
,
and
thus
is
poised
to
play
a
key
role
in
the
skeletal
system
.

To
understand
the
role
of
Hdac3
in
osteoblasts
and
osteocytes
,
Hdac3
conditional
knockout
(
CKO
)
mice
were
created
with
the
osteocalcin
(
OCN
)
promoter
driving
Cre
expression
.

Hdac3
CKO
(
OCN
)
mice
were
of
normal
size
and
weight
,
but
progressively
lost
trabecular
and
cortical
bone
mass
with
age
.

The
Hdac3
CKO
(
OCN
)
mice
exhibited
reduced
cortical
bone
mineralization
and
material
properties
and
suffered
frequent
fractures
.

Bone
resorption
was
lower
,
not
higher
,
in
the
Hdac3
CKO
(
OCN
)
mice
,
suggesting
that
primary
defects
in
osteoblasts
caused
the
reduced
bone
mass
.

Indeed
,
reductions
in
bone
formation
were
observed
.

Osteoblasts
and
osteocytes
from
Hdac3
CKO
(
OCN
)
mice
showed
increased
DNA
damage
and
reduced
functional
activity
in
vivo
and
in
vitro
.

Thus
,
Hdac3
expression
in
osteoblasts
and
osteocytes
is
essential
for
bone
maintenance
during
aging
.

The

are
widely
used
to
treat

Aconitine
(
AC
)
is
one
of
the
main
bioactive

high

toxic
alkaloids
of
Aconitum
roots
.

AC
is
metabolized
by
cytochrome

(
CYP

3A
.

However
,
whether
AC
inhibits
/
induces
CYP3A
,
which
causes
drug

(
DDI
)
is
unclear
.

Our
study
aims
to
explore
the
potent
effects
of
AC
,
as
a
marker
component
of
Aconitum
,
on
CYP3A
using
the
probe
buspirone
in
rats
.

The
effects
of
oral
AC
on
pharmacokinetics
of
buspirone
were
evaluated
.

CYP3A
activity
and
protein
levels
in
rat
liver
microsomes
pretreated
with
oral
AC
were
also
measured
using
in

buspirone
metabolism
and
Western

.

Buspirone
and
its
major
metabolites
1
-
(

pyrimidinyl
)
piperazine
and
6
'

hydroxybuspirone
were
determined
using
a

MS
method
.

Single
dose
and
7
-
day
AC
administration
at
0
.
125mg
/
kg
had
no
effect
on
CYP3A

since
no
change
in
the
formation
of

piperazine
and
6

CYP3A

microsomes
were
also
not
affected
by
7
-
day
AC
pretreatment
at
0
.
125mg

Therefore
,
AC
neither
inhibits
nor
induces

,
indicating
AC
does
not
cause

of
the
intrinsic

.

Nitrogen
-
containing
bisphosphonates
(
N
-
BPs
)
induce
apoptosis
in
tumor
cells
by
inhibiting
the
prenylation
of
small
G
-
proteins
.

However
,
the
details
of
the
apoptosis
-
inducing
mechanism
remain
obscure
.

The
present
study
showed
that
the
induction
of
apoptosis
by
N
-
BPs
in
hematopoietic
tumor
cells
is
mediated
by
mitochondrial
apoptotic
signaling
pathways
,
which
are
activated
by
the
suppression
of
geranylgeranyl
pyrophosphate
(
GGPP
)
biosynthesis
.

Furthermore
,
N
-
BPs
decreased
the
levels
of
phosphorylated
extracellular
signal
-
regulated
kinase
(
ERK
)
and
mTOR
via
suppression
of
Ras
prenylation
and
enhanced
Bim
expression
.

The
present
results
indicated
that
N
-
BPs
induce
apoptosis
by
decreasing
the
mitochondrial
transmembrane
potential
,
increasing
the
activation
of
caspase
-
9
and
caspase

3
,
and
enhancing
Bim
expression
through
inhibition
of
the
Ras
/
MEK
/
ERK
and
Ras
/
mTOR
pathways
.

The
accumulation
of
N

BPs
in
bones
suggests
that
they
may
act
more
effectively
on
tumors
that
have
spread
to

or
on

This
is
the
first

show
that
the

Aryl
hydrocarbon
receptor
-
mediated
disruption
of
contact
inhibition
is
associated
with
connexin43
downregulation
and
inhibition
of
gap
junctional
intercellular
communication
.

The
aryl
hydrocarbon
receptor
(
AhR
)
contributes
to
the
control
of
cell
-
to
-
cell
communication
,
cell
adhesion
,
migration
or
proliferation
.

In
the
present
study
,
we
investigated
the
regulation
of
connexin43
(
Cx43
)
and
Cx43
-
mediated
gap
junctional
intercellular

(
GJIC
)
during
the
AhR
-
dependent
disruption
of
contact
inhibition
in
non
-
tumorigenic
liver
epithelial
cells
.

The
contact
inhibition
of
cell
proliferation
is
a
process
restricting
the
cell
division
of
confluent
non
-
transformed
cells
,
which
is
frequently
abolished
in
cancer
cells
;
however
,
the
mechanisms
contributing
to
its
disruption
are
still
only
partially
understood
.

Disruption
of

which
was

AhR
ligands
2

-
tetrachlorodibenzo
-
p
-
dioxin
(
TCDD
)
or
polycyclic
aromatic
hydrocarbons
in
epithelial
WB
-
F344
cells
,
reduced
Cx43
protein
levels
,
possibly
via
enhanced
proteasomal
degradation
,
significantly
decreased
the
amount
of
gap
junction
plaques
and
downregulated
GJIC
,
in
an
AhR
-
dependent
manner
.

Although
both
intracellular
and
membrane
Cx43
pools
were
markedly
reduced
in
cells
released
from
contact
inhibition
by
TCDD
,
siRNA
-
mediated
Cx43
knock
-
down
was
not
sufficient
to
stimulate
proliferation
in
contact
-
inhibited
cells
.

Our
data
suggest
that
downregulation
of
Cx43
/
GJIC
in
non
-
transformed
epithelial
cells
is
an
inherent
part
of
disruption
of
contact
inhibition
,
which
occurs
at
the
post
-
transcriptional
level
.

This
process
runs
in
parallel
with
alterations
of
other
forms
of
cell
-
to
-
cell
communication
,
thus
suggesting
that
toxic
AhR
agonists
may
simultaneously
abrogate
contact
inhibition
and
reduce
GJIC
,
two
essential
mechanisms
linked
to
deregulation
of
cell

to

cell
communication
during
tumor
promotion
and
progression
.

Lysine
48
-
linked
polyubiquitination
of
organic
anion
transporter
-
1
is
essential
for
its
protein
kinase
C
-
regulated
endocytosis
.

Organic
anion
transporter
-
1
(
OAT1
)
mediates
the
body
'
s
disposition
of
a
diverse
array
of
environmental
toxins
and
clinically
important
drugs
.

Therefore
,
understanding
the
regulation
of
this
transporter
has
profound
clinical
significance
.

We
had
previously
established
that
OAT1
undergoes
constitutive
internalization
from
and
recycling
back
to
the
cell
surface
and
that
acute
activation
of
protein
kinase
C
(
PKC
)
inhibits
OAT1
activity
by
reducing
OAT1
cell
-
surface
expression
through
accelerating
its
internalization
from
cell
surface
to
intracellular
compartments
.

However
,
the
underlying
mechanisms
are
poorly
understood
.

In
the
current
study
,
we
provide
novel
evidence
that
acute
activation
of
PKC
significantly
enhances
OAT1
ubiquitination
both
in
vitro
and
ex
vivo
.

We
further
show
that
ubiquitination
of
cell
-
surface
OAT1
increases
in
cells
transfected
with
dominant
negative
mutant
of
dynamin
-
2
,
a
maneuver
blocking
OAT1
internalization
,
which
suggests
that
OAT1
ubiquitination
proceeds
before
OAT1
internalization
.

Mass
spectroscopy
has
revealed
that
ubiquitination
of
OAT1
consists
of
polyubiquitin
chains
,
primarily
through
lysine
48
linkage
.

Transfection
of
cells
with
the
dominant
negative
mutant
of
ubiquitin
Ub
-
K48R
,
which
prevents
the
formation
of
Lys48
-
linked
polyubiquitin
chains
,
abolishes
PKC
-
stimulated
OAT1
ubiquitination
and
internalization
.

Together
,
our
findings
demonstrate
for
the
first
time
that
Lys48

linked
polyubiquitination
is
essential
for
PKC

regulated
OAT1
trafficking
.

has
become
a
frontal
topic
in
the
field

The
pretreatment
with
rare

is
an
effective
method
,
but
the

of
REEs
is
unknown

Here
,
the

on
nitrogen

were
investigated
to
elucidate
the
regulation
mechanism
of
REEs
on

UV

led
to
the

in
the
activities
of
the
key
enzymes
(
nitrate

)
in

The

has
been
shown
to
hold
potent
anti

properties
in

in

.

To
investigate
the
effects
of
β

on
apoptosis

and
its
possible
mechanisms
of

,
we
qualified

(

-
AKT
pathway
in

The
results
demonstrated
that
β

-
induced
apoptosis
in
a
dose

manner
in
SGC

(
25

β

was
also
shown
to

inhibit
bcl

The
significantly

were
observed
in

in
a
time

.

Thus
,
the
apoptosis

in
SGC

7901
cells
by
β

may
be
regulated
through
a
PI3K

Further
,
the

suggesting
that
GGT
may
have
low

Hepatic

Among

,
CYP1B1

,
and
chlorzoxazone

,
but
not
midazolam

were
also
elevated
.

These
results
raise
the
possibility
that
GGT
extracts
may
increase
the
toxicity
of
environmental
toxicants
through
the
elevating
CYP

metabolic
activation
.

Interestingly
,
the

These

were
significantly
greater
in
inflamed

compared
with

.

In

NaHS
shifted
the

Sulfhydration
of
sulfonylurea
receptor

)
was
induced
by

These

suggest
that

Rosmarinic
acid
ameliorates

.

The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
investigate
the
therapeutic
potential
of
rosmarinic
acid
(
RA
)
,
a
natural
phenolic
,
in
the
treatment
of
acute
liver

.

RA
at

was
administered
by
gavage
once
daily
for
2
consecutive
days
,
6h
after
CCl
(
4
)
intoxication
.

CCl
(
4
)
intoxication
caused
hepatic
necrosis
and
increased
serum
ALT
activity
.

In
the
livers
,
oxidative

nitrosative
stress
was
evidenced
by
increased
3

nitrotyrosine
(

NT
)
and
thiobarbituric
acid
reactive
substances
(
TBARS
)
formation
and
a
significant
decrease
in
Cu

Zn
superoxide
dismutase
(
SOD
)
activity
.

CCl
(
4
)
administration
triggered
inflammatory
response
in
mice
livers
by
activating
nuclear
factor

kappaB
(
NF
-
κB
)
,
which
coincided
with
the
induction
of
tumor
necrosis
factor
-
alpha
(
TNF
-
α
)
and
cyclooxygenase
-
2
(
COX
-

)
.

RA
improved
histological
and
serum
markers
of
liver
damage
and
significantly
ameliorated
oxidative
/
nitrosative
stress
and
inflammatory
response
in
liver
tissue
.

Additionally
,
RA
prevented
transforming
growth
factor
-
beta1
(
TGF
-
β1
)
and
alpha
-
smooth
muscle
actin
(
α
-
SMA
)
expression
,
suggesting
suppression
of
profibrotic
response
.

Furthermore
,
RA
significantly
inhibited
the
CCl
(
4
)
-
induced
apoptosis
,
which
was
evident
from
decreased
cleavage
of
caspase
-
3
.

The
hepatoprotective
activity
of
RA
coincided
with
enhanced
NF

-
related
factor
2
(
Nrf2
)
and
heme
oxygenase

expression
.

The
results
of
this
study
indicates
that
RA
possesses
antioxidant
,
anti

inflammatory
,
antiapoptotic
and
antifibrotic
activity
against
acute
liver
toxicity
.

Antiarrhythmic

)
,
a
polyphenol
extracted
from

,
has
been
proposed
as
an
effective
compound
for
improving
cardiac
contractility
.

However
,
the
therapeutic
potential
of
ECG
on
the
treatment
of
arrhythmia
remains
unknown
.

We
investigated
the
direct
actions
of
ECG
on
the
modulation
of
ion

and
cardiac
cell
excitability
in
the
primary
culture
of
neonatal

)
,
which
is
considered
a
hypertrophic
model
for
analysis
of
myocardial
arrhythmias
.

By
using
the
whole

cell
patch
-
clamp
configurations
,
we
found
ECG
enhanced
the
slowly
inactivating
component
of
voltage

currents
(
I
(

)
)
in
a

100
μM
)
with
an
EC
(

.

ECG
not
only
shifted
the
current

voltage
relationship
of
peak
I
(
Na
)
to
the
hyperpolarizing
direction
but
also
accelerated
I

.

Working
at
a
concentration
level
of
I
(

enhancement
,
ECG
has
no
notable
effect
on
voltage

currents
.

With
culture
time
increment
,
the
firing
rate
of
spontaneous

potential
(
sAP
)
in
NRVMs
was
gradually
decreased
until
spontaneous
early
after
-
depolarization
(
EAD
)
was
observed
after
about
one
week
culture
.

ECG
increased
the
firing
rate
of
normal
sAP
about
two

fold
without
waveform
alteration
.

Interestingly
,
the
bradycardia

EAD
could
be
significantly
restored
by
ECG
in
fast
firing
rate
to
normal
sAP
waveform
.

The
expression
of
dominant
cardiac
sodium

was
consistently
detected
throughout
the

.

Our
results
reveal
how
ECG
,
the
novel

agonist
,
may
act
as
a
promising
candidate
in
clinical
applications
on
cardiac

Phillyrin
attenuates

accumulation
in

hepatocytes
through
the

.

Phillyrin
,
an
active
constituent
found
in
many
medicinal
plants
and
certain
functional
foods
,
has
anti

obesity
activity
in

.

The
aim
of
our
study
was
to
provide
new
data
on
the
molecular
mechanism
(
s
)
underlying
the
role
of
phillyrin
in
the
prevention
of
high
glucose
-
induced
lipid
accumulation
in
human
HepG2
hepatocytes
.

We
found
that
phillyrin
suppressed
high
glucose
-
induced
lipid
accumulation
in
HepG2
cells
.

Phillyrin
strongly
inhibited
high
glucose

)
expression
by
modulating
sterol
regulatory
element
-
binding

)
activation
.

Moreover
,
use
of
the
pharmacological
AMP
-
activated
protein
kinase
(
AMPK
)
inhibitor
compound
C
revealed
that
AMPK
is
essential
for
suppressing
SREBP
-
1c
expression
in
phillyrin
-
treated
cells
.

Finally
,
we
found
that
liver
kinase
B1
(
LKB1
)
phosphorylation
is
required
for
the
phillyrin
-
enhanced
activation
of
AMPK
in
HepG2
hepatocytes
.

These
results
indicate
that
phillyrin
prevents
lipid
accumulation
in
HepG2
cells
by
blocking
the
expression
of
SREBP
-
1c
and
FAS
through
LKB1
/
AMPK
activation
,
suggesting
that
phillyrin
is
a
novel
AMPK
activator
with
a
role
in
the
prevention
and
treatment
of
obesity
.

Physicochemical
parameters
that
influence
carotenoids
bioaccessibility
from
a
tomato
juice
.

In

digestion
models
have
been
developed
to
estimate
carotenoid
bioavailability
but
most
do
not
consider
that
their
diffusion
from
fruit
matrix
to
the
lipid
phase
of
the
bolus
could
be
a
limiting
step
.

Therefore
we
designed
a
model
in
which
tomato
juice
is
mixed
with
oil
or
oil
/
water
emulsions
,
and
the
carotenoids
diffusing
to
oil
are
measured
by

.

Temperature
,
pH
and
tomato
juice
/
peanut
oil
ratio
were
evaluated
for
their
influence
on
carotenoid
diffusion
.

When
oil
/
tomato
ratio
was
between
0
.
11
and
1
,
extraction
of
lycopene
was
limited
by
the
saturation
of
the
oil
phase
.

With
a
large
excess
of
oil
,
diffusion
was
also
limited
,
as
only
31
±
1
%
of
lycopene
could
be
extracted
from
the
juice
.

Diffusion
did
not
vary
significantly
with
pH
but
doubled
when
temperature
rose
from
10
°
C
to
37
°
C
.

When
the
juice
was
mixed
in
an
emulsion
stabilised
with
bovine
serum
albumin
or
phospholipids
the
maximum
extraction
decreased
to
14
.
5
±
0
.
2
%
and
18
.
5
±

5
%
respectively
,
indicating
that
in
addition
to
the
saturation
of
the
oil
phase
at
low
oil
/
tomato
ratio
and
in
addition
to
intrinsic
properties
of
the
tomato
juice
in
non
-
saturating
conditions
,
lycopene
diffusion
was
limited
by
the
structure
of
the
interface
in

.

Quantitative

.

High

H
NMR
spectroscopy
was
proposed
for
the
determination
of
the
fatty
acid
chain
profile
of
lipids
in
pork
meat
products
during

.

Two
typical
Mediterranean
PDO
salami
produced
in
Calabria
,
a
region
in
the
Southern
Italy
,
were
chosen
as
a
case
of
study
.

Quantitative
NMR
analysis
provided
the
fatty
acid
chain
profiles
of
total
lipid
extracts
.

The
transesterification
of
total
lipid
extracts
furnished
FAME
mixtures
that
enabled
quantitation
of
fatty
acid
acyl
chains
in
the
acylglycerol
and
FFA
portions
.

In
all
cases
,
oleyl
chains
were
predominant
,
and
high
amounts
of
polyunsaturated
fatty
acid
chains
were
observed
.

The
proposed
spectroscopic
method
allowed
also
the
estimation
of
the
most
important
nutritional
parameters
of
dry
fermented
meat
products
.

The
neuropathologic
mechanisms
after
exposure
to
lethal
doses
of

are
complex
and
involve
multiple

requires
drugs
that
can

,
is
a
naturally

Toxicities

.

The
synthetic

,
[

,
is
less

Neuroprotective
role
of
ATP
-
sensitive
potassium
channels
in
cerebral
ischemia
.

ATP
-
sensitive
potassium
(
K
(
ATP
)
)
channels
are
weak
,
inward
rectifiers
that
couple
metabolic
status
to
cell
membrane
electrical
activity
,
thus
modulating
many
cellular
functions
.

An
increase
in
the
ADP
/
ATP
ratio
opens
K
(
ATP
)
channels
,
leading
to
membrane
hyperpolarization
.

K
(
ATP
)
channels
are
ubiquitously
expressed
in
neurons
located
in
different
regions
of
the
brain
,
including
the
hippocampus
and
cortex
.

Brief
hypoxia
triggers
membrane
hyperpolarization
in
these
central
neurons
.

In
vivo
animal
studies
confirmed
that
knocking
out
the
Kir6
.
2
subunit
of
the
K
(
ATP
)
channels
increases
ischemic
infarction
,
and
overexpression
of
the
Kir6
.
2
subunit
reduces
neuronal
injury
from
ischemic
insults
.

These
findings
provide
the
basis
for
a
practical
strategy
whereby
activation
of
endogenous
K
(
ATP
)
channels
reduces
cellular
damage
resulting
from
cerebral
ischemic
stroke
.

K
(
ATP

modulators
may
prove
to
be
clinically
useful
as

explicated
till
date
.

Based
on
this
background
,
we
performed
molecular
dynamics
simulation
to
probe
the
structural
stability
of
Indian
variant
(
L307P
)
in
comparison
with
wild
and
other
BChE
variants
(
D70G
,
E497V
,
V142M
)
having
differential
esterase
activity
.

The
simulation
of
all
the
mutants
except
D70G
showed
a
much
larger
Cα
root
mean
square
deviation
from
the
wild
BChE
crystal
structure
,
showing
the
overall
conformational
disturbance
.

Further
analysis
revealed
that
secondary
structure
of
the
mutant
proteins
was
not
stable
.

The
orientation
of
the
catalytic
triad
is
also
distorted
in
all
the
mutants
.

The
distance
between
δ
nitrogen
of
His438
to
ε
oxygen
of
Glu325
and
ε
nitrogen
of
His438
to
γ
oxygen
of
Ser198
were
highly
altered
in
L307P
mutant
than
the
wild
and
other
three
variants
throughout
the
simulation
.

Such
disparity
of
distances
between
the
catalytic
residues
may
be
due
to
the
change
in
the
protein
conformation
attributing
to
their
differential
catalytic
activity
.

Our
studies
thus
prove
that
the
Indian
BChE
L307P
mutant
with
negligible
activity
is
possibly
due
to
its
structural
instability
when
compared
to
other
BChE
variants
.

A
mutation
in
the
FAM36A
gene
,
the
human
ortholog
of
COX20
,
impairs
cytochrome
c
oxidase
assembly
and
is
associated
with
ataxia
and
muscle
hypotonia
.

The
mitochondrial
respiratory
chain
complex
IV
(
cytochrome
c
oxidase
)
is
a
multi
-
subunit
enzyme
that
transfers
electrons
from
cytochrome
c
to
molecular
oxygen
,
yielding
water
.

Its
biogenesis
requires
concerted
expression
of
mitochondria
-
and
nuclear
-
encoded
subunits
and
assembly
factors
.

In
this
report
,
we
describe
a
homozygous
missense
mutation
in
FAM36A
from
a
patient
who
displays
ataxia
and
muscle
hypotonia
.

The
FAM36A
gene
is
a
remote
,
putative
ortholog
of
the
fungal
complex
IV
assembly
factor
COX20
.

Messenger
RNA
(
mRNA
)
and
protein
co
-
expression
analyses
support
the
involvement
of
FAM36A
in
complex
IV
function
in
mammals
.

The
c
.
154A
>
C
mutation
in
the
FAM36A
gene
,
a
mutation
that
is
absent
in
sequenced
exomes
,
leads
to
a
reduced
activity
and
lower
levels
of
complex
IV
and
its
protein
subunits
.

The
FAM36A
protein
is
nearly
absent
in
patient
'
s
fibroblasts
.

Cells
affected
by
the
mutation
accumulate
subassemblies
of
complex
IV
that
contain
COX1
but
are
almost
devoid
of
COX2
protein
.

We
observe
co
-
purification
of
FAM36A
and
COX2
proteins
,
supporting
that
the
FAM36A
defect
hampers
the
early
step
of
complex
IV
assembly
at
the
incorporation
of
the
COX2
subunit
.

Lentiviral
complementation
of
patient
'
s
fibroblasts
with
wild
-
type
FAM36A
increases
the
complex
IV
activity
as
well
as
the
amount
of
holocomplex
IV
and
of
individual
subunits
.

These
results
establish
the
function
of
the
human
gene
FAM36A
/
COX20
in
complex
IV
assembly
and
support
a
causal
role
of
the
gene
in
complex
IV
deficiency
.

Protective

This
study
was
designed
to
investigate
the
potential
effects
of
14days
'
intragastrically
given
of
cinnamon
polyphenols
(
CPS
)
in
treating
diabetic
mice
induced
by

(

)
and

.

The
diabetic

model
was
successfully
established
through

.

As
revealed

treatments
significantly
resulted
in
down

regulation
of
blood
glucose
and
insulin
levels
in
serum
,
while
the
levels
of
oxidative
stress
markers
were
markedly
lowered
through
ELISA
assay
.

Meanwhile
,
the
pathological
damage
in
islet
with
pancreatic
beta
cells
was
ameliorated
by
treatment
of
CPS
at
different
doses
,
as
shown
in
HE
stain
.

At
the
same
time
,
the
treatments
also
caused
notable
reduction
of
iNOS
,
NF
-
κB
expressions
showing
in
Western

analysis
.

These
findings
demonstrate
that
cinnamon
polyphenols
can
exert
the
hypoglycemic
and
hypolipidemic
effects
through
the
mechanisms
that
may
be
associated
with
repairing
pancreatic
beta
cells
in
diabetic
mice
and
improving
its
anti

,
as
well
as
attenuating

Polymorphisms
in
OCTN1
and
OCTN2
transporters
genes
are
associated
with
prolonged
time
to
progression
in
unresectable
gastrointestinal
stromal
tumours
treated
with
imatinib
therapy
.

The
two
basic
mainstays
of
gastrointestinal
stromal
tumours
(
GIST
)
treatment
are
surgery
and
imatinib
,
a
selective
tyrosine
kinase
inhibitor
that
allows
achieving
a
stable
or
responding
disease
in
about
80
%
of
patients
with
unresectable
/
metastatic
GIST
.

Response
to
imatinib
mainly
depends
from
KIT
and
PDGFRα
mutational
status
.

Nevertheless
,
some
patients
with
a
potentially
responsive
genotype
do
not
respond
,
and
others
develop
a
pattern
of
resistance
to
imatinib
which
is
not
associated
with
secondary
mutations
.

This
emphasizes
the
presence
of
mechanisms
of
resistance
other
than
the
receptor
-
related
genotype
,
and
the
need
of
biological
predictors
to
select
the
optimal
therapeutic
strategy
,
particularly
now
that
other
potent
inhibitors
are
available
.

We
investigated
a
panel
of
31
polymorphisms
in
11
genes
,
potentially
associated
with
the
pharmacogenetics
of
imatinib
,
in
a
group
of
54
unresectable
/
metastatic
GISTs
treated
with
imatinib
400mg
daily
as
first
line
therapy
.

Included
in
this
analysis
were
polymorphisms
in
the
transporters
'
family
SLC22
,
SLCO
,
ABC
,
and
in
the
metabolizing
genes
CYP
-
3A4
and
-
3A5
.

Time
to
progression
was
significantly
improved
in
presence
of
the
C
allele
in
SLC22A4
(
OCTN1
rs1050152
)
,
and
the
two
minor
alleles
(
G
)
in
SLC22A5
(
OCTN2
rs2631367
and
rs2631372
)
.

Importantly
,
multivariate
analysis
,
adjusting
for
age
,
gender
,
KIT
/
PDGFRα
mutational
status
,
and
tumour
size
,
revealed
that
all
the
three
genotypes
maintained
independent
predictive
significance
.

In
conclusion
,
in
this
study
we
showed
that
SLC22A4
and
SLC22A5
genotypes
may
be
an
important
predictor
of
time
to
progression
in
GIST
patients
receiving
imatinib
therapy
.

Further
investigations
are
required
in
an
attempt
to
further
personalize
GIST
therapy
.

Long
range
effect
of
mutations
on
specific
conformational
changes
in
the
extracellular
loop
2
of
angiotensin
II
type
1
receptor
.

The
topology
of
the
second
extracellular
loop
(
ECL2
)
and
its
interaction
with
ligands
is
unique
in
each
G
protein
-
coupled
receptor
.

When
the
orthosteric
ligand
pocket
located
in
the
transmembrane
(
TM
)
domain
is
occupied
,
ligand
-
specific
conformational
changes
occur
in
the
ECL2
.

In
more
than
90
%
of
G
protein
-
coupled
receptors
,
ECL2
is
tethered
to
the
third
TM
helix
via
a
disulfide
bond
.

Therefore
,
understanding
the
extent
to
which
the
TM
domain
and
ECL2
conformations
are
coupled
is
useful
.

To
investigate
this
,
we
examined
conformational
changes
in
ECL2
of
the
angiotensin
II
type
1
receptor
(
AT1R
)
by
introducing
mutations
in
distant
sites
that
alter
the
activation
state
equilibrium
of
the
AT1R
.

Differential
accessibility
of
reporter
cysteines
introduced
at
four
conformation
-
sensitive
sites
in
ECL2
of
these
mutants
was
measured
.

Binding
of
the
agonist
angiotensin
II
(
AngII
)
and
inverse
agonist
losartan
in
wild
-
type
AT1R
changed
the
accessibility
of
reporter
cysteines
,
and
the
pattern
was
consistent
with
ligand
-
specific
"
lid
"
conformations
of
ECL2
.

Without
agonist
stimulation
,
the
ECL2
in
the
gain
of
function
mutant
N111G
assumed
a
lid
conformation
similar
to
AngII
-
bound
wild
-
type
AT1R
.

In
the
presence
of
inverse
agonists
,
the
conformation
of
ECL2
in
the
N111G
mutant
was
similar
to
the
inactive
state
of
wild
-
type
AT1R
.

In
contrast
,
AngII
did
not
induce
a
lid
conformation
in
ECL2
in
the
loss
of
function
D281A
mutant
,
which
is
consistent
with
the
reduced
AngII
binding
affinity
in
this
mutant
.

However
,
a
lid
conformation
was
induced
by
[
Sar
(
1
)
,
Gln
(
2
)
,
Ile
(
8
)
]
AngII
,
a
specific
analog
that
binds
to
the
D281A
mutant
with
better
affinity
than
AngII
.

These
results
provide
evidence
for
the
emerging
paradigm
of
domain
coupling
facilitated
by
long
range
interactions
at
distant
sites
on
the
same
receptor
.

Heteromtoxin
(

HmTx
)
is
a

phospholipase
A
(

)
produced
in
Heterometrus

,
in

.

In
this

,
HmTx
was
purified
from
venom
by
separation
chromatography
,
and
the
PLA
(
2
)
activity
of
the
fractions
was
determined
by

and
an

.

The
nucleotide
sequence
of
HmTx
contains
649
bp
,
and
the
mature

is
predicted
to
have
131
amino

residues
-
104
of
which
make
up
the
large
subunit
,
and
27
of
which
make
up

The

is
highly
similar
to
that
of

dioxin
(
TCDD
)
is
an
endocrine
disruptor
affecting
the
reproductive
system
in
humans
.

The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
evaluate
the
effects
of
TCDD
administered
to
pregnant
mice
at
two
different
doses
(
2
-
10
ng
/
kg

)
,
on
imprinted
genes
in
the
male
offspring
.

The
degree
of
methylation
and
the
mRNA
expression
of
Snrpn
,
Peg3
and
Igf2r
were
analyzed
in
the
sperm
,
skeletal
muscle
and
liver
.

TCDD
administration
(
10
ng
/
kg
/
day
)
decreased
the
sperm
count
in
the
male
offspring
.

It
did
not
affect
methylation
but
increased
mRNA
expression
of
Snrpn
,
Peg3
,
Igf2r
and
Air
ncRNA
.

In
muscle
and
liver
,
TCDD
(
10
ng
/
kg
/
day
)
induced
increases
in
methylation
and
decreases
in
mRNA
expression
of
Igf2r
.

These
results
show
that
the
robust
effects
of
TCDD
on
the
mRNA
expression
of
Snrpn
,
Peg3
and
Igf2r
genes
in
the
sperm
and
of
Igf2r
in
the
muscle
and
liver
are
unrelated
to
changes
in

.

Inhibition
of
17β

HSD2
is
an
attractive
mechanism
for
the
treatment
of

.

We
report
here
the
optimization
of
human
17β

HSD2
inhibitors
in
the
2
,
5

class
by
varying
the
size
of
the
linker
(
n
equals
0
and
2
)
between
the
amide
moiety
and
the
phenyl
group
.

While
none
of
the
phenethylamides
(
n
=
2
)
were
active
,
most
of
the
anilides
(
n
=
0
)
turned
out
to
moderately
or
strongly
inhibit
17β
-
HSD2
.

The
four
most
active
compounds
showed
an
IC₅₀
of
around
60
nM
and
a
very
good
selectivity
toward
17β

.

The
investigated
compounds
inhibited

-
HSD2
moderately
,
and
one
of
them
showed
good
inhibitory
activity
on
mouse

.

SAR
studies
allowed
a
first
characterization
of
the

,
which
is
predicted
to
be
considerably
larger
than
that
of

Dietary
phytochemicals
as
adjuvants
have
been
suggested
to
play
important
roles
in
enhancing
chemotherapeutic
potential
owing
to
multitargeted
chemopreventive

Here
,
we

were
effectively
decreased
by
the
combined

of
them
.

In
combination
with
clofarabine
,
the
ability
of
resveratrol
to
reduce
the
contents
of
Sp1
and
its
target
gene
products
was
also
evident
in
a
time

experiment
.

The
inhibition
of
phosphoinositide
3

kinase
using
Ly294002
augmented
a
decrease
in
the
p21
level
induced
by
their
combination
,
but
it
showed
no
significant
effects
on
expression
of
Sp1
and
cyclin
D1
.

Taken
together
,
the
data
provide
evidence
that
the
synergistic
antiproliferative
effect
of
resveratrol
and
clofarabine
is
linked
to
the
inhibition
of
Akt
and
Sp1
activities
,
and
suggest
that
this
combination
may
have
therapeutic
value
in
treatment
of

acts
as
a
potent
proinflammatory
cytokine
and
is
involved
in
the

EG
)
is
a
new
active
compound
from
Reynoutria
japonica
,
and
its
biologic
activities
have
not
been
previously
investigated
.

In
this
study
,
we
first
investigated
the
antiinflammatory
activities
of
EG
on
HMGB1
-
mediated
proinflammatory
responses
in
human
umbilical
vein
endothelial
cells
(
HUVECs
)
and
in
a
murine
cecal
ligation
and
puncture
(
CLP
)
-
model
of
sepsis
in
mice
.

EG
was
found
to
suppress
the
release
of
HMGB1
,
the
production
of
tumor
necrosis
factor
(
TNF
)
-
α
,
and
the
activation
of
nuclear
factor
-
κB
(
NF
-
κB
)
by
HMGB1
in
HUVECs
,
and
to
inhibit
HMGB1
-
mediated
hyperpermeability
and
leukocyte
migration
in
mice
.

In
the
CLP
model
,
HMGB1
was
highly
released
,
but
this
release
was
prevented
by
EG
.

Furthermore
,
EG
also
increased
the
survival
times
of
CLP
administered
mice
.

Collectively
,
this
study
shows
EG
can
protect
barrier
integrity
and
inhibit
HMGB1
-
mediated
inflammatory
responses
,
which
suggests
a
potential
use
as
a
therapy
for

Linking
GABA
(
A
)
receptor
subunits
to
alcohol
-
induced
conditioned
taste
aversion
and
recovery
from
acute
alcohol
intoxication
.

GABA
type
A
receptors
(
GABA
(
A
)
-
R
)
are
important
for
ethanol
actions
and
it
is
of
interest
to
link
individual
subunits
with
specific
ethanol
behaviors
.

We
studied
null
mutant
mice
for
six
different
GABA
(
A
)
-
R
subunits
(
α1
,
α2
,
α3
,
α4
,
α5
and
δ
)
.

Only
mice
lacking
the
α2
subunit
showed
reduction
of
conditioned
taste
aversion
(
CTA
)
to
ethanol
.

These
results
are
in
agreement
with
data
from
knock
-
in
mice
with
mutation
of
the
ethanol
-
sensitive
site
in
the
α2
-
subunit
(
Blednov
et
al
.
,
2011
)
.

All
together
,
they
indicate
that
aversive
property
of
ethanol
is
dependent
on
ethanol
action
on
α2
-
containing
GABA
(
A
)
-
R
.

Deletion
of
the
α2
-
subunit
led
to
faster
recovery
whereas
absence
of
the
α3
-
subunit
slowed
recovery
from
ethanol
-
induced
incoordination
(
rotarod
)
.

Deletion
of
the
other
four
subunits
did
not
affect
this
behavior
.

Similar
changes
in
this
behavior
for
the
α2
and
α3
null
mutants
were
found
for
flurazepam
motor
incoordination
.

However
,
no
differences
in
recovery
were
found
in
motor
-
incoordinating
effects
of
an
α1
-
selective
modulator
(
zolpidem
)
or
an
α4
-
selective
agonist
(
gaboxadol
)
.

Therefore
,
recovery
of
rotarod
incoordination
is
under
control
of
two
GABA
(
A
)
-
R
subunits
:
α2
and
α3
.

For
motor
activity
,
α3
null
mice
demonstrated
higher
activation
by
ethanol
(
1
g
/
kg
)
whereas
both
α2
(
-
/
-
)
and
α3
(
-
/
Y
)
knockout
mice
were
less
sensitive
to
ethanol
-
induced
reduction
of
motor
activity
(
1
.
5
g
/
kg
)
.

These
studies
demonstrate
that
the
effects
of
ethanol
at
GABAergic
synapses
containing
α2
subunit
are
important
for
specific
behavioral
effects
of
ethanol
which
may
be
relevant
to
the
genetic
linkage
of
the
α2
subunit
with
human
alcoholism
.

Arsenic
activates

protein
-

to
inhibit

Dysfunctional

and

contribute
to

-
a
major
public
health
concern
that
enhances
cardiovascular

risk
.

Arsenic
(
As
(
III
)
)
exposure
may
increase
metabolic
syndrome
and
cardiovascular
disease
risk
by
impairing
adipose
tissue
differentiation
,
function
,
and
insulin
sensitivity
through
pathogenic
mechanisms
that
remain
unclear
.

We
hypothesized
that
As
(
III
)
signals
through
the
Pertussis
toxin
(
Ptx
)
sensitive
,
Gi
protein
-
coupled
receptor
(
GPCR
)
to
impair
adipogenesis
,
as
previously
demonstrated
for
its
stimulation
of
vascular
oxidant
generation
,
angiogenesis
,
and
remodeling
.

Because
both
As
(
III
)
and
GPCR
ligands
inhibit
progenitor
cell
differentiation
into
adipocytes
,
we
investigated
the
hypothesis
in
a
model
of
low
-
passage
human
mesenchymal
stem
cells
(
hMSC
)
.

As
(
III
)
(
0

.
0
µM
)
suppressed
dexamethasone
/
insulin
-
induced
hMSC
adipogenesis
,
as
indicated
by
decreased
transcriptional
promoters
of
differentiation
,
decreased
fat
droplet
formation
,
and
decreased
expression
of
differentiated
adipocyte
markers
,
such
as
adiponectin
and
perilipin
.

Preincubating
hMSC
with
Ptx
prevented
90
%
of
the
suppressive
effect
of
As
(
III
)
.

Selective
competitive
antagonists
of
Gi
-
coupled
endothelin
-
1
type
A
and
B
receptors
were
~
60
%
effective
in
blocking
As
(
III
)
inhibition
and
combination
of
antagonists
to
both
receptors
were
85
%
effective
.

In
contrast
,
antagonists
to
the
sphingosine
-
1
-
phosphate
type
1
receptor
(
previously
shown
to
mediate
As
(
III
)
vascular
effects
)
or
the
angiotensin
II
type
1
receptor
were
ineffective
in
blocking
As
(
III
)
effects
.

These
studies
suggest
a
majority
of
arsenic
-
inhibited
adipocyte
differentiation
,
and
metabolism
requires
endothelin
-
1
GPCRs
and
that
As
(
III
)
effects
on
GPCR
signaling
are
tissue
and
context
specific
.

This
may
represent
a
significant
mechanism
for
the
contribution
of
arsenic
exposure
to
increased
metabolic
and
cardiovascular
diseases
.

;
yet
,
the
mechanism

is
not
well

.

Using
normal
human
epidermal
keratinocytes
,
we
investigated
the
mechanism
of
TCDD
-
mediated
enhancement
of
epidermal
differentiation
by
integrating
functional
genomic
,
metabolomic
,
and
biochemical
analyses
.

TCDD
increased
the
expression
of
40
%
of
the
genes
of
the
epidermal
differentiation
complex
found
on
chromosome
1q21
and
75
%
of
the
genes
required
for
de

ceramide
biosynthesis
.

Lipid
analysis
demonstrated
that
eight
of
the
nine
classes
of
ceramides
were
increased
by
TCDD
,
altering
the
ratio
of
ceramides
to
free
fatty
acids
.

TCDD
decreased
the
expression
of
the
glucose
transporter
,
SLC2A1
,
and
most
of
the
glycolytic
transcripts
,
followed
by
decreases
in
glycolytic
intermediates
,
including
pyruvate
.

NADH
and
Krebs
cycle
intermediates
were
decreased
,
whereas
NAD
(

)
was
increased
.

Mitochondrial
glutathione
(
GSH
)
reductase
activity
and
the
GSH
/
glutathione
disulfide
ratio
were
decreased
by
TCDD
,
ultimately
leading
to
mitochondrial
dysfunction
,
characterized
by
decreased
inner
mitochondrial
membrane
potential
and
ATP
production
,
and
increased
production
of
the
reactive

,
hydrogen

Aryl
hydrocarbon
receptor
(
AHR
)
antagonists
blocked
the
response
of
many
transcripts
to
TCDD
,
and
the
endpoints
of
decreased
ATP
production
and
differentiation
,
suggesting
regulation
by
the

Cotreatment
of

enzyme
catalase
blocked
the
TCDD
-
mediated
acceleration
of
keratinocyte
cornified
envelope
formation
,
an
endpoint
of
terminal

.

Thus
,
TCDD

is
a
critical
step
in
the
mechanism
of
this
chemical
to
accelerate
keratinocyte

IFNα
converts

Besides
their

activity
,
type

Interferons
(
IFN
)
display

.

In
contrast
to
long

,
Interleukin
(
IL

-
22
is
an
anti

,
largely
tissue
protective
cytokine
that
recently
gained
attention
.

Herein
,
cellular
IFNα
/
IL

22
interactions
are
investigated
.

We
report
that
pre
-
conditioning
of
epithelial
cells
with
IFNα
initiated
dramatic
changes
in
IL
-
22
signaling
normally
dominated
by
signal
transducer
and
activator
of
transcription
(
STAT
)
-

.

Specifically
,
by
using
human
DLD1
colon
epithelial
/
carcinoma
cells
we
demonstrate
that
,
upon
IFNα
,
IL
-
22
converts
into
a
cytokine
robustly
activating
STAT1
and
its
downstream
pro
-
inflammatory
targets
CXCL9
,
CXCL10
,
and
inducible
nitric
oxide

(

)
.

Accordingly
,
only
after
IFNα
pre
-
incubation
was
IL
-
22
-
induced
STAT1
binding
to
the
CXCL10
promoter
detectable
.

Using
the
viral
mimic
polyinosinic
:
polycytidylic
acid
and
the
IFNα
/
β
antagonist
B18R
we
furthermore
demonstrate
the
capability
of
endogenous
IFN
to
promote
IL
-
22
-
induced
STAT1
activation
and
expression
of
CXCL10
.

IL

22
-
induced
STAT1

subsequent
to

became
likewise
apparent
in
human
Caco2

Current

To
enhance
the
survival
of
irradiated

,
we
have
compared
the
effects
and
mechanism
of
Bcl

and
its
functional
variants
,
D34A
(

.

Bcl

its

were
transfected
into
hematopoietic
cell
line
and
assessed
for
cell
survival
,
clonogenicity
and
cell

perturbations
upon
exposure
to
ionizing

.

The
electrostatic
potential
of

of
Bcl

2
/
mutants
and
their
heterodimerization
with
Bcl
-
2
associated
X

(
Bax
)
were
computationally
evaluated
.

Correspondingly
,
these
results
were
verified
by
co

immunoprecipitation
and
western

.

The
mutants
afford
higher
radioprotective
effect
than

in

clonogenic
assays
at
D
(
0
)
(
radiation

which
37

observed
)
.

The
computational
and
functional
analysis
indicates
that
mutants
have
higher
propensity
to
neutralize
Bax
protein
by
heterodimerization
and
have
increased
caspase

capability
,
which
is
responsible
for
enhanced

.

This
study
implies
potential
of
Bcl

to
elicit
radioprotective

in

A
novel

has
been
developed
in
the
current

Glutaraldehyde

were
loaded
with
the

-
which
couples
the

and
is
released
in

.

Albumin
nanoparticles
were
surface

coated
with
bifunctional
polyethylene

and
a
nanobody

the
single

-
(
Ega1

against
the

showed
a
40

fold
higher
binding
to
EGFR

in
comparison
to
PEGylated

.

17864

L
(

)
loaded
EGa1
-
PEG
nanoparticles
were
internalized
by
clathrin
-
mediated
endocytosis
and
ultimately
digested
in
lysosomes
.

The
intracellular
routing
of
EGa1
targeted
nanoparticles
leads
to
a
successful
release
of
the
kinase
inhibitor
in
the
cell
and
inhibition
of

whereas
the
non

had
no

effects
on
14C

.

The
drug
loaded
targeted
nanoparticles
were
as
effective
as
the
free
drug
in

.

These
results
demonstrate
that
multikinase
inhibitor
loaded
nanoparticles
are
interesting
nanomedicines
for
the
treatment
of
EGFR

.

Purification

The
Thai
banded

is
one
of
the
most
dangerous
vespid
species
in
Southeast
Asia
,
and
stinging
accidents
involving
this
species
still
cause
fatalities
.

In
the
present
study
,
four
forms
of
V
.
affinis
phospholipase
A
(
1
)
were
identified
through
a
proteomics
approach
.

Two
of
these
enzymes
were
purified
by
reverse

phase
chromatography
,
and
their
biochemical
properties
were
characterised
.

These
enzymes
,
designated
Ves
a

,
are
not
glycoproteins
and
exist
as
33441

5
and
33474
.
4
Da
proteins
,
which
corresponded
with
the
34
-
kDa
band
observed
via
SDS

.

The
thermal
stabilities
of
these
enzymes
were
stronger
than
snake
venom
.

Using
an
in

assay
,
no
difference
was
found
in
the
toxicities
of
the
different
isoforms
.

Furthermore
,
the
toxicity
of
these
enzymes
does
not
appear
to
be
correlated
with
their
PLA
(
1
)
activity
.

The
cDNAs
of
the
full

length
version
of
Ves
a
1s
revealed
that
the
Ves
a
1
gene
consists
of
a
1005

ORF
,
which
encodes
334
amino
acid
residues
,
and
67
-
and
227

bp
5
'
and
3
'
UTRs
,
respectively
.

The
two
isoforms
are
different
by
three
nucleotide
substitutions
,
resulting
in
the
replacement
of
two
amino
acids
.

Through
sequence
alignment
,
these
enzymes
were
classified
as
members
of
the
pancreatic

used
the
rat
pancreatic

(
1bu8A

as
a
template
because
it
has
PLA

that
play
important
roles
in
substrate
selectivity
(
the
lid
domain
and
the
β9
loop
)
were
shortened
in
the
Ves
a
1
structure
,
which
suggests
that
this
enzyme
may
only
exhibit
phospholipase
activity
.

Moreover
,
the
observed
insertion
of
proline
into
the
lid
domain
of
the
Ves
a
1
structure
is
rare
.

We
therefore
propose
that
this
proline
residue
might
be
involved
in
the
stability
and
activity
of
Ves

Hydroxysafflor

inhibits
lipopolysaccharide
-
induced
inflammatory
signal
transduction
in
human
alveolar
epithelial
A549
cells
.

Hydroxysafflor
yellow
A
(
HSYA
)
is
an
active
ingredient
obtained
from
the
flower
of
Carthamus
tinctorius
L
.

The
present
study
investigated
the
effects
of
HSYA
on
lipopolysaccharide
(
LPS
)
-
induced
inflammatory
signal
transduction
in
human
alveolar
epithelial
A549
cells
.

A549
cells
stimulated
with
LPS
were
incubated
with
three
doses
of
HSYA
(
1
,
4
and
16μmol
/
L
)
.

HSYA
suppressed
the
expression
of
TLR
-
4
,
Myd88
,
ICAM
-
1
,
TNFα
,
IL
-
1β
and
IL
-
6
at
the
mRNA
and
protein
level
,
and
inhibited
the
adhesion
of
leukocytes
to
A549
cells
.

HSYA
treatment
also
decreased
NF
-
κB
p65
nuclear
translocation
and
inhibited
the
phosphorylation
of
p38
mitogen
-
activated
protein
kinase
(
p38
MAPK
)
.

These
findings
suggest
that
HSYA
effectively
inhibits
LPS
-
induced
inflammatory
signal
transduction
in
A549
cells
.

Gliotransmission
and
brain
glucose
sensing
:
critical
role
of
endozepines
.

Hypothalamic
glucose
sensing
is
involved
in
the
control
of
feeding
behavior
and
peripheral
glucose
homeostasis
,
and
glial
cells
are
suggested
to
play
an
important
role
in
this
process
.

Diazepam
-
binding
inhibitor
(
DBI
)
and
its
processing
product
the
octadecaneuropeptide
(
ODN
)
,
collectively
named
endozepines
,
are
secreted
by
astroglia
,
and
ODN
is
a
potent
anorexigenic
factor
.

Therefore
,
we
investigated
the
involvement
of
endozepines
in
brain
glucose
sensing
.

First
,
we
showed
that
intracerebroventricular
administration
of
glucose
in
rats
increases
DBI
expression
in
hypothalamic
glial
-
like
tanycytes
.

We
then
demonstrated
that
glucose
stimulates
endozepine
secretion
from
hypothalamic
explants
.

Feeding
experiments
indicate
that
the
anorexigenic
effect
of
central
administration
of
glucose
was
blunted
by
coinjection
of
an
ODN
antagonist
.

Conversely
,
the
hyperphagic
response
elicited
by
central
glucoprivation
was
suppressed
by
an
ODN
agonist
.

The
anorexigenic
effects
of
centrally
injected
glucose
or
ODN
agonist
were
suppressed
by
blockade
of
the
melanocortin
-
3
/
4
receptors
,
suggesting
that
glucose
sensing
involves
endozepinergic
control
of
the
melanocortin
pathway
.

Finally
,
we
found
that
brain
endozepines
modulate
blood
glucose
levels
,
suggesting
their
involvement
in
a
feedback
loop
controlling
whole
-
body
glucose
homeostasis
.

Collectively
,
these
data
indicate
that
endozepines
are
a
critical
relay
in
brain
glucose
sensing
and
potentially
new
targets
in
treatment
of
metabolic
disorders
.

The
structure
and
properties
of
septin
3
:
a
possible
missing
link
in
septin
filament
formation
.

The
human
genome
codes
for
13
members
of
a
family
of
filament
-
forming
GTP
-
binding
proteins
known
as
septins
.

These
have
been
divided
into
four
different
subgroups
on
the
basis
of
sequence
similarity
.

The
differences
between
the
subgroups
are
believed
to
control
their
correct
assembly
into
heterofilaments
which
have
specific
roles
in
membrane
remodelling
events
.

Many
different
combinations
of
the
13
proteins
are
theoretically
possible
and
it
is
therefore
important
to
understand
the
structural
basis
of
specific
filament
assembly
.

However
,
three
-
dimensional
structures
are
currently
available
for
only
three
of
the
four
subgroups
.

In
the
present
study
we
describe
the
crystal
structure
of
a
construct
of
human
SEPT3
which
belongs
to
the
outstanding
subgroup
.

This
construct
(
SEPT3
-
GC
)
,
which
includes
the
GTP
-
binding
and
C
-
terminal
domains
,
purifies
as
a
nucleotide
-
free
monomer
,
allowing
for
its
characterization
in
terms
of
GTP
-
binding
and
hydrolysis
.

In
the
crystal
structure
,
SEPT3
-
GC
forms
foreshortened
filaments
which
employ
the
same
NC
and
G
interfaces
observed
in
the
heterotrimeric
complex
of
human
septins
2
,
6
and
7
,
reinforcing
the
notion
of
'
promiscuous
'
interactions
described
previously
.

In
the
present
study
we
describe
these
two
interfaces
and
relate
the
structure
to
its
tendency
to
form
monomers
and
its
efficiency
in
the
hydrolysis
of
GTP
.

The
relevance
of
these
results
is
emphasized
by
the
fact
that
septins
from
the
SEPT3
subgroup
may
be
important
determinants
of
polymerization
by
occupying
the
terminal
position
in
octameric
units
which
themselves
form
the
building
blocks
of
at
least
some
heterofilaments
.

Supra
-
normal
stimulation
of
dopamine
D1
receptors
in
the
prelimbic
cortex
blocks
behavioral
expression
of
both
aversive
and
rewarding
associative
memories
through
a
cyclic
-
AMP
-
dependent
signaling
pathway
.

Dopamine
(
DA
)
receptor
transmission
through
either
D
(
1
)
or
D
(
2
)
-
like
subtypes
is
involved
critically
in
the
processing
of
emotional
information
within
the
medial
prefrontal
cortex
(
mPFC
)
.

However
the
functional
role
of
specific
DA
D
(
1
)
-
like
receptor
transmission
in
the
expression
of
emotionally
salient
associative
memories
(
either
aversive
or
rewarding
)
is
not
currently
understood
.

Here
we
demonstrate
that
specific
activation
of
DA
D
(
1
)
receptors
in
the
prelimbic
(
PLC
)
division
of
the
mPFC
causes
a
transient
block
in
the
behavioral
expression
of
both
aversive
and
rewarding
associative
memories
.

We
report
that
intra
-
PLC
microinfusions
of
a
selective
D
(
1
)
receptor
agonist
block
the
spontaneous
expression
of
an
associative
olfactory
fear
memory
,
without
altering
the
stability
of
the
original
memory
trace
.

Furthermore
,
using
an
unbiased
place
conditioning
procedure
(
CPP
)
,
intra
-
PLC
D
(
1
)
receptor
activation
blocks
the
spontaneous
expression
of
an
associative
morphine
(
5
mg
/
kg
;
i
.
p
.
)
reward
memory
,
while
leaving
morphine
-
primed
memory
expression
intact
.

Interestingly
,
both
intra
-
PLC
D
(
1
)
-
receptor
mediated
block
of
either
fear
-
related
or
reward
-
related
associative
memories
were
dependent
upon
downstream
cyclic
-
AMP
(
cAMP
)
signaling
as
both
effects
were
rescued
by
co
-
administration
of
a
cAMP
signaling
inhibitor
.

The
blockade
of
both
rewarding
and
aversive
associative
memories
is
mediated
through
a
D
(
1
)
-
specific
signaling
pathway
,
as
neither
forms
of
spontaneous
memory
expression
were
blocked
by
intra
-
PLC
microinfusions
of
a
D
(
2
)
-
like
receptor
agonist
.

Our
results
demonstrate
that
the
spontaneous
expression
of
either
rewarding
or
aversive
emotionally
salient
memories
shares
a
common
,
D
(

-
receptor

The
glycogen

3β
/
nuclear
factor
-
kappa
B
pathway
is
involved
in
cinobufagin
-
induced
apoptosis
in
cultured
osteosarcoma
cells
.

Cinobufagin
,
a
major
component
of
cinobufacini
(
huachansu
)
,
is
an
important
cardenolidal
steroid
.

Several
studies
have
suggested
that
cinobufagin
has
potent
anti
-
cancer
effects
.

The
present
study
examines
the
apoptosis
-
inducing
activity
and
the
underlying
mechanism
of
action
of
cinobufagin
in
osteosarcoma
(
OS
)
cells
.

Our
results
showed
that
cinobufagin
potently
inhibited
the
proliferation
of
U2OS
,
MG63
and
SaOS
-
2
cells
.

Significant
increases
in
G2
/
M
cell
-
cycle
arrest
and
apoptosis
in
OS
cells
were
also
observed
.

The
expression
levels
of
several
apoptotic
proteins
were
assessed
after
cinobufagin
treatment
in
U2OS
cells
.

Among
them
,
xIAP
,
cIAP
-
1
,
survivin
and
Bcl
-
2
levels
decreased
remarkably
,
while
the
levels
of
Bax
and
cleaved
-
PARP
increased
.

Furthermore
,
we
validated
the
inhibition
of
GSK
-
3β
/
NF
-
κB
signaling
following
cinobufagin
treatment
.

Western
blots
showed
a
decrease
in
nuclear
p65
protein
expression
after
exposure
to
different
concentrations
of
cinobufagin
,
while
the
phosphorylation
of
GSK
-
3β
was
simultaneously
increased
.

Transduction
with
constitutively
active
forms
of
GSK
-
3β
could
protect
against
the
downregulation
of
p65
and
upregulation
of
cleaved
-
PARP
that
are
induced
by
cinobufagin
treatment
.

However
,
combined
treatment
with
cinobufagin
and
SB216367
resulted
in
a
significant
reduction
in
p65
and
an
increase
in
cleaved
-
PARP
in
U2OS
cells
.

Altogether
,
these
results
show
that
cinobufagin
is
a
promising
agent
for
the
treatment
of
OS
.

These
studies
are
the
first
to
reveal
the
involvement
of
the
GSK

3β
/
NF
-
κB
pathway
in
cinobufagin
-

EphB4
enhances
the
process
of
endochondral
ossification
and
inhibits
remodeling
during
bone
fracture
repair
.

Previous
reports
have
identified
a
role
for
the
tyrosine
kinase
receptor
EphB4
and
its
ligand
,
ephrinB2
,
as
potential
mediators
of
both
bone
formation
by
osteoblasts
and
bone
resorption
by
osteoclasts
.

In
the
present
study
,
we
examined
the
role
of
EphB4
during
bone
repair
after
traumatic
injury
.

We
performed
femoral
fractures
with
internal
fixation
in
transgenic
mice
that
overexpress
EphB4
under
the
collagen
type
1
promoter
(
Col1
-
EphB4
)
and
investigated
the
bone
repair
process
up
to
12
weeks
postfracture
.

The
data
indicated
that
Col1
-
EphB4
mice
exhibited
stiffer
and
stronger
bones
after
fracture
compared
with
wild
-
type
mice
.

The
fractured
bones
of
Col1
-
EphB4
transgenic
mice
displayed
significantly
greater
tissue
and
bone
volume
2
weeks
postfracture
compared
with
that
of
wild
-
type
mice
.

These
findings
correlated
with
increased
chondrogenesis
and
mineral
formation
within
the
callus
site
at
2
weeks
postfracture
,
as
demonstrated
by
increased
safranin
O
and
von
Kossa
staining
,
respectively
.

Interestingly
,
Col1
-
EphB4
mice
were
found
to
possess
significantly
greater
numbers
of
clonogenic
mesenchymal
stromal
progenitor
cells
(
CFU
-
F
)
,
with
an
increased
capacity
to
form
mineralized
nodules
in
vitro
under
osteogenic
conditions
,
when
compared
with
those
of
the
wild
-
type
control
mice
.

Furthermore
,
Col1
-
EphB4
mice
had
significantly
lower
numbers
of
TRAP
-
positive
multinucleated
osteoclasts
within
the
callus
site
.

Taken
together
,
these
observations
suggest
that
EphB4
promotes
endochondral
ossification
while
inhibiting
osteoclast
development
during
callus
formation
and
may
represent
a
novel
drug
target
for
the
repair
of
fractured
bones
.

the

Deficits
in
male
sexual
behavior
in
adulthood
after
social
instability
stress
in
adolescence
in
rats
.

There
is
increasing
evidence
that
exposure
to
stressors
in
adolescence
has
long
-
lasting
effects
on
emotional
and
cognitive
behavior
,
but
little
is
known
as
to
whether
reproductive
functions
are
affected
.

We
investigated
appetitive
and
consummatory
aspects
of
sexual
behavior
in
male
rats
that
were
exposed
to
chronic
social
instability
stress
(
SS
,
n

)
for
16
days
in
mid

adolescence
compared
to
control
rats
(
CTL
,
n
=
24
)
.

Over
five
sexual
behavior
test
sessions
with
a
receptive
female
,
SS
rats
made
fewer
ejaculations
(
p
=
0
.
02
)
and
had
longer
latencies
to
ejaculation
(
p
=
0
.
03
)
.

When
only
data
from
rats
that
ejaculated
in
the
fifth
session
were
analyzed
,
SS
rats
(
n
=
18
)
had
reduced
copulatory
efficiency
(
more
mounts
and
intromissions
before
ejaculation
)
compared
to
CTL
rats
(
n
=
19
)
(
p
=
0
.
004
)
,
and
CTL
rats
were
twice
as
likely
as
SS
rats
to
make
more
than
one
ejaculation
in
the
fifth
session
(
p
=
0
.
05
)
.

Further
,
more
CTL
(
14
/
24
)
than
SS
(
5
/
25
)
rats
ejaculated
in
four
or
more
sessions
(
p
=
0
.
05
)
.

SS
rats
had
lower
plasma
testosterone
concentrations
than
CTL
rats
(
p
=
0
.
05
)
,
but
did
not
differ
in
androgen
receptor
,
estrogen
receptor
alpha
,
or
Fos
immunoreactive
cell
counts
in
the
medial

.

The
groups
did
not
differ
in
a
partner
preference
test
administered
between
the
fourth
and
fifth
sexual
behavior
session
.

The
results
suggest
that
developmental
history
contributes
to
individual
differences
in
reproductive
behavior
,
and
that
stress
exposures
in
adolescence
may
be
a
factor
in
sexual
sluggishness
.

Importantly
,
the

improves
the
physicochemical

Pulmonary
delivery
of
an
aerosolized
recombinant
human
butyrylcholinesterase
pretreatment
protects
against
aerosolized
paraoxon
in
macaques
.

Butyrylcholinesterase
(
BChE
)
is
the
leading
pretreatment
candidate
against
exposure
to
organophosphates
(
OPs
)
,
which
pose
an
ever
increasing
public
and
military
health
.

Since
respiratory
failure
is
the
primary
cause
of
death
following
acute
OP
poisoning
,
an
inhaled
BChE
therapeutic
could
prove
highly
efficacious
in
preventing
acute
toxicity
as
well
as
the
associated
delayed
neuropathy
.

To
address
this
,
studies
have
been
performed
in
mice
and
macaques
using
Chinese
Hamster
Ovary
cells
(
CHO
)
-
derived
recombinant
(
r
)
BChE
delivered
by
the
pulmonary
route
,
to
examine
whether
the
deposition
of
both
macaque
(
Ma
)
and
human
(
Hu
)
rBChE
administered
as
aerosols
(
aer
)
favored
the
creation
and
retention
of
an
efficient
protective
"
pulmonary
bioshield
"
that
could
scavenge
incoming
(
inhaled
)
OPs
in

thereby
preventing
entry
into
the
circulation
and
inhibition
of
plasma
BChE
and
AChE
on
red
blood
cells
(
RBC
-
AChE
)
and
in
cholinergic
synapses
.

In
contrast
to
parenteral
delivery
of
rBChE
,
which
currently
requires
posttranslational
modification
for
good
plasma
stability
,
an
unmodified
aer

rBChE
pretreatment
given
1
-
40h
prior
to
>
1
LD50
of
aer
-
paraoxon
(
Px
)
was
able
to
prevent
inhibition
of
circulating
cholinesterase
in
a
dose
-

manner
.

These
studies
are
the
first
to
show
protection
by
rBChE
against
a
pesticide
such
as
paraoxon
when
delivered
directly
into
the
lung
and
bode
well
for
the
use
of
a
non

invasive
and
consumer
friendly
method
of
rHuBChE
delivery
as
a
human
treatment
to
counteract

The

been
suggested
to

Additionally
,
direct

has
been
provided
that
D
(

Signaling

,
such

could
be
involved
in
the

Altogether
,
these

stand
at

may
be
considered
as

The

is
to
provide
a
critical

to
support
the

Additionally
,
myocardial

Results
showed
that

the

and
glucagon

.

In
several
other
cell
lineages
,
insulin
is
able
to
stimulate
p21
-
activated
protein
kinase
1
(
Pak1
)
.

Here
we
determined
the
role
of
Pak1
in
gcg
expression
and
the
effect
of
Pak1
deletion
on

.

Insulin
stimulated

through
increasing
its
Thr423
phosphorylation
in
gut

expressing
cell
lines
,
associated
with
increased

levels
.

This

was
attenuated
by

were
reduced
in

,
associated
with
impaired

Finally
,
the

exhibited
reduced

and
abolished
β

We
suggest
that
Pak1
mediates
the
cross

Insulin
-
degrading
enzyme
(
IDE
)
:
a
novel
heat
shock
-
like
protein
.

Insulin
-
degrading
enzyme
(
IDE
)
is
a
highly
conserved
zinc
metallopeptidase
that
is
ubiquitously
distributed
in
human
tissues
,
and
particularly
abundant
in
the
brain
,
liver
,
and
muscles
.

IDE
activity
has
been
historically
associated
with
insulin
and
β
-
amyloid
catabolism
.

However
,
over
the
last
decade
,
several
experimental
findings
have
established
that
IDE
is
also
involved
in
a
wide
variety
of
physiopathological
processes
,
including
ubiquitin
clearance
and
Varicella
Zoster
Virus
infection
.

In
this
study
,
we
demonstrate
that
normal
and
malignant
cells
exposed
to
different
stresses
markedly
up
-
regulate
IDE
in
a
heat
shock
protein
(
HSP
)
-
like
fashion
.

Additionally
,
we
focused
our
attention
on
tumor
cells
and
report
that
(
i
)
IDE
is
overexpressed
in
vivo
in
tumors
of
the
central
nervous
system
(
CNS
)
;
(
ii
)
IDE
-
silencing
inhibits
neuroblastoma
(
SHSY5Y
)
cell
proliferation
and
triggers
cell
death
;
(
iii
)
IDE
inhibition
is
accompanied
by
a
decrease
of
the
poly
-
ubiquitinated
protein
content
and
co
-
immunoprecipitates
with
proteasome
and
ubiquitin
in
SHSY5Y
cells
.

In
this
work
,
we
propose
a
novel
role
for
IDE
as
a
heat
shock
protein
with
implications
in
cell
growth
regulation
and
cancer
progression
,
thus
opening
up
an
intriguing
hypothesis
of
IDE
as
an
anticancer
target
.

Silencing
α1
,
3
-
fucosyltransferases
in
human
leukocytes
reveals
a
role
for
FUT9
enzyme
during
E
-
selectin
-
mediated
cell
adhesion
.

Leukocyte
adhesion
during
inflammation
is
initiated
by
the
binding
of
sialofucosylated
carbohydrates
expressed
on
leukocytes
to
endothelial
E
/
P
-
selectin
.

Although
the
glycosyltransferases
(
glycoTs
)
constructing
selectin
-
ligands
have
largely
been
identified
using
knock
-
out
mice
,
important
differences
may
exist
between
humans
and
mice
.

To
address
this
,
we
developed
a
systematic
lentivirus
-
based
shRNA
delivery
workflow
to
create
human
leukocytic
HL
-
60
cell
lines
that
lack
up
to
three
glycoTs
.

Using
this
,
the
contributions
of
all
three
myeloid
α1
,
3
-
fucosyltransferases
(
FUT4
,
FUT7
,
and
FUT9
)
to
selectin
-
ligand
biosynthesis
were
evaluated
.

The
cell
adhesion
properties
of
these
modified
cells
to
L
-
,
E
-
,
and
P
-
selectin
under
hydrodynamic
shear
were
compared
with
bone
marrow
-
derived
neutrophils
from
Fut4
(
-
/
-
)
Fut7
(
-
/
-
)
dual
knock
-
out
mice
.

Results
demonstrate
that
predominantly
FUT7
,
and
to
a
lesser
extent
FUT4
,
forms
the
selectin
-
ligand
at
the
N
terminus
of
leukocyte
P
-
selectin
glycoprotein
ligand
-
1
(
PSGL
-
1
)
in
humans
and
mice
.

Here
,
85
%
reduction
in
leukocyte
interaction
was
observed
in
human
FUT4
(
-
)
7
(
-
)
dual
knockdowns
on
P
/
L
-
selectin
substrates
.

Unlike
Fut4
(
-
/

)
Fut7
(
-
/
-
)
mouse
neutrophils
,
however
,
human
knockdowns
lacking
FUT4
and
FUT7
only
exhibited
partial
reduction
in
rolling
interaction
on
E
-
selectin
.

In
this
case
,
the
third
α1
,
3
-
fucosyltransferase
FUT9
played
an
important
role
because
leukocyte
adhesion
was
reduced
by
50
-
60
%
in
FUT9
-
HL
-
60
,
70
-
80
%
in
dual
knockdown
FUT7
(

)
9

cells
,
and
∼
85
%
in
FUT4
(
-
)
7
(

)
9
(

)
triple
knockdowns
.

Gene
silencing
results
are
in
agreement
with
gain

of
-
function
experiments
where
all
three
fucosyltransferases
conferred
E
-
selectin
-
mediated
rolling
in
HEK293T
cells
.

This
study
advances
new
tools
to
study
human
glycoT
function
.

It
suggests
a
species

specific
role
for
FUT9
during
the
biosynthesis
of
human
E

selectin
ligands
.

Hyperglycemia
slows
embryonic
growth
and
suppresses
cell
cycle
via
cyclin
D1
and
p21
.

In
pregnant
women
,
the
diabetic
condition
results
in
a
three
-
to
fivefold
increased
risk
for
fetal
cardiac
malformations
as
a
result
of
elevated
glucose
concentrations
and
the
resultant
osmotic
stress
in
the
developing
embryo
and
fetus
.

Heart
development
before
septation
in
the
chick
embryo
was
studied
under
two
hyperglycemic
conditions
.

Pulsed
hyperglycemia
induced
by
daily
administration
of
glucose
during
3
days
of
development
caused
daily
spikes
in
plasma
glucose
concentration
.

In
a
second
model
,
sustained
hyperglycemia
was
induced
with
a
single
injection
of
glucose
into
the
yolk
on
day
0
.

The
sustained
model
raised
the
average
plasma
glucose
concentration
from
70
mg
/
dL
to
180
mg
/
dL
and
led
to
decreased
gene
expression
of
glucose
transporter
GLUT1
.

Both
models
of
hyperglycemia
reduced
embryo
size
,
increased
mortality
,
and
delayed
development
.

Within
the
heart
outflow
tract
,
reduced
proliferation
of
myocardial
and
endocardial
cells
resulted
from
the
sustained
hyperglycemia
and
hyperosmolarity
.

The
cell
cycle
inhibitor
p21
was
significantly
increased
,
whereas
cyclin
D1
,
a
cell
cycle
promoter
,
decreased
in
sustained
hyperglycemia
compared
with
controls
.

The
evidence
suggests
that
hyperglycemia
-
induced
developmental
delays
are
associated
with
slowed
cell
cycle
progression
,
leading
to
reduced
cellular
proliferation
.

The
suppression
of
critical
developmental
steps
may
underlie
the
cardiac
defects
observed
during
late
gestation
under
hyperglycemic
conditions
.

"
Ecstasy
"
(

methylenedioxymethamphetamine
or
MDMA
)
is
a
widely
abused
recreational
drug
,
reported
to
produce
neurotoxic

,
both
in
laboratory
animals
and
in
humans
.

MDMA

can
be
major
contributors
for
MDMA

.

This
work
studied
the
neurotoxicity
of

Differentiation
led
to
SH
-
SY5Y
neurons
with
higher
ability
to
accumulate
dopamine
and
higher
resistance
towards
dopamine
neurotoxicity
.

MDMA
catechol

,
leading
to
caspase

MDMA
did
not

Pre

treatment
with
the

,
prevented

.

Cells
exposed
to
α

MeDA
showed
an
increase
in
intracellular
glutathione
(
GSH
)
levels
,
which
,
at
the
48

point
,
was
not

in
the

of
γ

,
revealing
a
possible

Importantly
,
pre
-
treatment
with
buthionine
sulfoximine
(
BSO
)
,
an
inhibitor
of
γ
-
GCS
,
prevented
α

increase
in
GSH
levels
,
but
did
not
augment
this

.

Even
so
,
BSO
pre

treatment
abolished
NAC

effects
against
α

,
which
were
,
at

partially
,
due

In

Effect
of

in

.

Selenite
cataract
,
as
an
experimental
animal
model
of
nuclear

to
mimic
human
senile
cataract
,
is
produced
only
when
overdose
selenite
is
injected
to
neonatal
rats
before

.

To
clarify
the
cause
of
age
differences
on
selenite
cataract
formation
in
rats
,
mRNA
expression
of
GPx1
,
MsrA
and
MsrB1
,
as
well
as
GPx
activity
in
Wistar
rat
lens
at
different
ages
were
assayed
,
level
of
lipid

,
extent
of
lens
damage
induced
by
sodium
selenite
and
barricade
function
of
blood
-
retinal
barrier
(
BRB
)
were
investigated
.

The
results
showed
that
mRNA
expressions
and
activity
of
antioxidant
enzymes
in
neonatal
rat
lens
before
eyelid
opening
were
the
highest
and
then
decreased
with
age
,
and
revealed
by
transmission
electron
microscopy
(
TEM
)
using
lanthanum
hydroxide
as
tracer
that
higher
selenite
content
entering
eyes
injured
lens
and
resulted
in
cataract
formation
for
immature
BRB
before
eyelid
opening
,
moreover
,
a
little
selenite
content
entering
eyes
was
not
enough
to
induce
cataract
formation
after
eyelid
opening
because
of
mature
BRB
.

Polymethoxyflavones
as
agents
that
prevent
formation
of
cataract
:
nobiletin
congeners
show
potent
growth
inhibitory
effects
in
human
lens

.

Posterior
capsular
opacification
(
PCO
)
is
the
most
frequent
complication
and
the
primary
reason
for
visual
decrease
after
extracapsular
cataract
surgery
.

The
proliferation
and
migration
of
leftover
lens
epithelial
cells
(
LECs
)
after
surgery
may
contribute
to
the
development
of
PCO
.

To
prevent
PCO
,
a
rational
approach
would
be
to
inhibit
both
the
proliferation
and
the
migration
of
LECs
using
nontoxic
xenobiotics
.

Nobiletin
,
one
of
the
most
abundant
polymethoxyflavones
(
PMFs
)
in
citrus
peel
,
and
its
synthetic
congeners
displayed
a
potent
inhibition
of
LEC
proliferation
.

Structural
features
which

Inhibitors

Protein
(

are
guardian
ubiquitin
ligases
that
keep
classic
proapoptotic
proteins
in
check
.

Systematic

is
challenged
by
the
heterogeneity
and
sheer
number
of

(

Here
we
report
a

Reduced
plasma
oxytocin
levels
in
female
patients
with
borderline
personality
disorder
.

The
neuropeptide
oxytocin
is
involved
in
social
cognition
and
interaction
across
species
and
plays
a
crucial
role
in
the
regulation
of
affiliative
behaviors
.

Oxytocin
levels
in
cerebrospinal
fluid
(
CSF
)
,
but
also
in
plasma
or
urine
,
have
been
shown
to
be
negatively
associated
with
childhood
traumata
,
aggressive
behavior
,
and
suicide
attempts
.

Recently
,
an
altered
activity
of
the
oxytocin
system
has
been
discussed
to
play
a
prominent
role
in
borderline
personality
disorder
(
BPD
)
,
which
is
thought
to
be
closely
related
to
traumatic
experiences
in
childhood
and
is
characterized
by
(
para
)
suicidal
behaviors
as
well
as
aggressive
outbursts
.

In
the
present
study
,
we
compared
plasma
oxytocin
levels
of
women
with
and
without
BPD
in
the
follicular
phase
and
assessed
the
relationship
between
oxytocin
concentrations
and
childhood
traumata
.

Women
diagnosed
with
BPD
had
significantly
reduced
oxytocin
concentrations
,
even
after
controlling
for
estrogen
,
progesterone
,
and
contraceptive
intake
.

In
addition
,
plasma
oxytocin
correlated
negatively
with
experiences
of
childhood
traumata
,
in
particular
with
emotional
neglect
and
abuse
.

The
results
of
mediation
analyses
do
not
support
a
model
of
oxytocin
being
a
prominent
mediator
in
the
link
between
childhood
trauma
and
BPD
.

Thus
,
the
findings
indicate
dysregulations
in
the
oxytocin
system
of
patients
diagnosed
with
BPD
with
more
longitudinal
research
being
necessary
to
disentangle
the
relationship
between
childhood
adversities
,
oxytocin
system
,
and
psychopathology
.

Identification
of
a
novel
benzimidazole
derivative
as
a

Optimization
of
HTS

for
NPY

led
to
the
identification
of
some

for
in

.

Among
them
,

inhibited
food
intake
induced
by
the
NPY
Y5
selective

and
chronic

and
a
shell
of
crosslinked
poly
(
methacrylic

)
(
PMAA
)
,
were
successfully
synthesized
via
distillation
precipitation
polymerization
.

The
pKa
of
the
composite
microsphere
increased
with
the
increase
in
the
crosslinking
density
.

Doxorubicin
hydrochloride
(
DOX
)
was
applied
as
a
model
drug
,
and
the
behavior
of
drug
storage
/
release
was
investigated
.

The
cumulative
release
of
DOX
-
loaded
composite
microsphere
in
vitro
showed
that
the
drug
release
rate
was
much
faster
below
its
pKa
than
that
of
above
its
pKa
.

Because
pH
of
most
tumor
tissues
was
lower
than
that
of
normal
tissues
,
the
pH
-
responsive
composite
microspheres
are
promising

Combining
QSAR
classification
models
for
predictive
modeling
of
human
monoamine
oxidase
inhibitors
.

Due
to
their
role
in
the
metabolism
of
monoamine
neurotransmitters
,
MAO
-
A
and
MAO
-
B
present
a
significant
pharmacological
interest
.

For
instance
the
inhibitors
of
human
MAO
-
B
are
considered
useful
tools
for
the
treatment
of
Parkinson
Disease
.

Therefore
,
the
rational
design
and
synthesis
of
new
MAOs
inhibitors
is
considered
of
great
importance
for
the
development
of
new
and
more
effective
treatments
of
Parkinson
Disease
.

In
this
work
,
Quantitative
Structure
Activity
Relationships
(
QSAR
)
has
been
developed
to
predict
the
human
MAO
inhibitory
activity
and
selectivity
.

The
first
step
was
the
selection
of
a
suitable
dataset
of
heterocyclic
compounds
that
include
chromones
,
coumarins
,
chalcones
,
thiazolylhydrazones
,
etc
.

These
compounds
were
previously
synthesized
in
one
of
our
laboratories
,
or
elsewhere
,
and
their
activities
measured
by
the
same
assays
and
for
the
same
laboratory
staff
.

Applying
linear
discriminant
analysis
to
data
derived
from
a
variety
of
molecular
representations
and
feature
selection
algorithms
,
reliable
QSAR
models
were
built
which
could
be
used
to
predict
for
test
compounds
the
inhibitory
activity
and
selectivity
toward
human
MAO
.

This
work
also
showed
how
several
QSAR
models
can
be
combined
to
make
better
predictions
.

The
final
models
exhibit
significant
statistics
,
interpretability
,
as
well
as
displaying
predictive
power
on
an
external
validation
set
made
up
of
chromone
derivatives
with
unknown
activity
(
that
are
being
reported
here
for

by
our

From
traditional
European
medicine
to
discovery
of
new
drug
candidates
for
the
treatment
of
dementia
and
Alzheimer
'
s
disease
:
acetylcholinesterase
inhibitors
.

The
leading
Alzheimer
'
s
disease
(
AD
)
therapeutics
to
date
involves
inhibitors
of
acetylcholinesterase
(
AChE
)
,
which
should
,
in
principle
,
elevate
cholinergic
signaling
and
limit
inflammation
.

In
spite
of
the
effectiveness
in
20
%
-
30
%
of
AD
patients
,
more
attention
has
been
paid
to
find
new
anti
-
AChE
agents
from
medicinal
plants
.

Galanthamine
,
contained
in
the
bulbs
and
flowers
of
Galanthus
and
related
genera
like
Narcissus
,
represents
a
good
example
.

The
aim
of
this
study
is
to
review
the
role
of
possible
AChE
inhibitors
(
AChEI
)
present
in
plants
traditionally
used
in
European
medicine
for
improving
memory
.

Starting
from
Galanthamine
,
properties
of
Melissa
species
,
Salvia
officinalis
,
Arnica
chamissonis
and
Ruta
graveolens
are
discussed
to
point
to
the
role
of
these
plants
as
potential
sources
for
the
development
of
therapeutic
agents
for
AD
.

The
strong
angular
dependence
of
the
CK
and
FK
edge
NEXAFS
spectra
on
the
incident
radiation
indicates
that
room

temperature

produced
graphite
fluoride
is
a
highly
anisotropic
material
,
where
half
of
the
carbon
atoms
are
covalently
bonded
with
fluorine
,
while
the
rest
of
the
carbon
atoms
preserve
π
electrons
.

Comparison
of
the
experimental
CK
edge
spectrum
with
theoretical
spectra
plotted
for
C
(

)
F
models
reveals
that
fluorine
atoms
are
more
likely
to
form
chains
.

This
conclusion
agrees
with
the
atomic
force

observation
of
a
chain

like
pattern
on
the
surface
of
graphite
fluoride
layers

Platelet

in
overweight
/
obese
women
with
the
polycystic
ovary
syndrome
.

A
substantial
proportion
of
women
with
the
polycystic
ovary
syndrome
(
PCOS
)
are
obese
and
obesity
is
considered
as
a
prothrombotic
state
.

Platelet
-
derived
microparticles
(
PMPs
)
might
be
implicated
in
the
activation
of
the
coagulation
cascade
.

We
aimed
to
assess
plasma
PMPs
in
overweight
/
obese
women
with
PCOS
.

We
measured
plasma
PMPs
and
determined
anthropometric
,
metabolic
,
hormonal
and
ultrasonographic
features
of
PCOS
in
67
overweight
/
obese
women
with
PCOS
(
with
body

0
kg

(

)
)
and
in
21
BMI
-
matched
healthy
women
.

Circulating
androgens
and
markers
of
insulin
resistance
(
IR
)
were
higher
in
women
with
PCOS
than
in
controls
.

Plasma
PMPs
were
also
higher
in
women
with
PCOS
than
in
controls
(
p
=
0
.
046
)
.

In
women
with
PCOS
,
plasma
PMPs
correlated
with
the
mean
number
of
follicles
in
the
ovaries
(
r
=
0
.
343
;
p

.
006
)
.

In
controls
,
plasma
PMPs
did
not
correlate
with
any
of
the
studied
parameters
.

In
conclusion
,
plasma
PMPs
are
elevated
in
overweight
/
obese
women
with
PCOS
compared
with
BMI
-
matched
controls
.

The
cause
of
this
increase
is
unclear
but
both
IR
and
hyperandrogenemia
might
be
implicated
.

More
studies
are
required
to
elucidate
the
pathogenesis
of
the
elevation
of
PMPs
in
PCOS
and
to
assess
its
implications
on
the
cardiovascular
risk
of
these
patients

DNA
polymerase
POLQ
and
cellular
defense
against
DNA
damage
.

In
mammalian
cells
,
POLQ
(
pol
θ
)
is
an
unusual
specialized
DNA
polymerase
whose
in
vivo
function
is
under
active
investigation
.

POLQ
has
been
implicated
by
different
experiments
to
play
a
role
in
resistance
to
ionizing
radiation
and
defense
against
genomic
instability
,
in
base
excision
repair
,
and
in
immunological
diversification
.

The
protein
is
formed
by
an
N
-
terminal
helicase
-
like
domain
,
a
C
-
terminal
DNA
polymerase
domain
,
and
a
large
central
domain
that
spans
between
the
two
.

This
arrangement
is
also
found
in
the
Drosophila
Mus308
protein
,
which
functions
in
resistance
to
DNA
interstrand
crosslinking
agents
.

Homologs
of
POLQ
and
Mus308
are
found
in
multicellular
eukaryotes
,
including
plants
,
but
a
comparison
of
phenotypes
suggests
that
not
all
of
these
genes
are
functional
orthologs
.

Flies
defective
in
Mus308
are
sensitive
to
DNA
interstrand
crosslinking
agents
,
while
mammalian
cells
defective
in
POLQ
are
primarily
sensitive
to
DNA
double
-
strand
breaking
agents
.

Cells
from
Polq
(
-
/
-
)
mice
are
hypersensitive
to
radiation
and
peripheral
blood
cells
display
increased
spontaneous
and
ionizing
radiation
-
induced
levels
of
micronuclei
(
a
hallmark
of
gross
chromosomal
aberrations
)
,
though
mice
apparently
develop
normally
.

Loss
of
POLQ
in
human
and
mouse
cells
causes
sensitivity
to
ionizing
radiation
and
other
double
strand
breaking
agents
and
increased
DNA
damage
signaling
.

Retrospective
studies
of
clinical
samples
show
that
higher
levels
of
POLQ
gene
expression
in
breast
and
colorectal
cancer
are
correlated
with
poorer
outcomes
for
patients
.

A
clear
understanding
of
the
mechanism
of
action
and
physiologic
function
of
POLQ
in
the
cell
is
likely
to
bear
clinical
relevance
.

Neuroprotective
effects
of
oxymatrine
against
excitotoxicity
partially
through
down
-
regulation
of
NR2B
-
containing
NMDA
receptors
.

Oxymatrine
(
OMT
)
is
a
major
bioactive
component
derived
from
Sophora
flavescens
Ait
(
kushen
)
,
which
is
widely
used
in
Chinese
medicine
.

Recent
studies
have
shown
that
it
has
neuroprotective
effects
;
however
,
its
underlying
mechanisms
remain
unclear
.

We
focus
on
the
mechanisms
of
pharmacologic
action
in
OMT
by
detecting
its
pharmacological
properties
against
focal
cerebral
ischemia
in
vivo
and
NMDA
-
induced
neurotoxicity
in
vitro
.

OMT
prevented
cerebral
ischemic
injury
in
mice
induced
via
a
2
h
middle
cerebral
artery
occlusion
and
a
24
h
reperfusion
,
in
vivo
.

In
vitro
cultured
neurons
challenged
with
N
-
methyl
-
D
-
aspartate
(
NMDA
,
200
μM
)
for
30
min
showed
significant
decrease
in
the
viability
of
neurons
;
however
,
OMT
was
able
to
protect
neurons
against
induced
neurotoxicity
via
NMDA
exposure
.

Western
blot
analysis
revealed
that
OMT
decreased
the
expression
of
Bax
and
repaired
the
balance
of
pro
-
and
anti
-
apoptotic
proteins
.

Furthermore
,
OMT
significantly
reversed
the
up
-
regulation
of
NR2B
and
inhibited
the
calcium
overload
in
the
cultured
neurons
after
challenging
the
NMDA
.

OMT
showed
partial
protection
in
the
cortical
neurons
via
down
-
regulation
of
NR2B
containing
NMDA
receptors
and
up
-
regulation
of
Bcl
-
2
family
.

Our
results
provide
new
insights
into
the
development
of
natural
therapeutic
anti
-
oxidants
against
ischemia
.

In
vitro
investigation
of
efficacy
of
new
reactivators
on
OPC
inhibited
rat
brain
acetylcholinesterase
.

Organophosphorus
compounds
(
OPC
)
were
developed
as
warfare
nerve
agents
.

They
are
also
widely
used
as
pesticides
.

The
drug
therapy
of
intoxication
with
OPC
includes
mainly
combination
of
cholinesterase
(
ChE
)
reactivators
and
cholinolytics
.

There
is
no
single
ChE
reactivator
having
an
ability
to
reactivate
sufficiently
the
inhibited
enzyme
due
to
the
high
variability
of
chemical
structure
of
the
inhibitors
.

The
difficulties
in
reactivation
of
ChE
activity
and
slight
antidote
effect
regarding
intoxication
with
some
OPC
are
some
of
the
reasons
for
continuous
efforts
to
obtain
new
reactivators
of
ChE
.

The
aim
of
the
present
study
was
to
evaluate
the
efficacy
of
some
ChE
reactivators
against
OPC
intoxication
(
tabun
,
paraoxon
and
dichlorvos
)
in
in
vitro
experiments
and
to
compare
their
activity
to
that
known
for
some
currently
used
oximes
(
obidoxime
,
HI
-
6
,
2
-
PAM
)
.

Experiments
were
carried
out
using
rat
brain
acetylcholinesterase
(
AChE
)
.

Reactivators
showed
different
activity
in
the
reactivation
of
rat
brain
AChE
after
dichlorvos
,
paraoxon
and
tabun
inhibition
.

AChE
was
easier
reactivated
after
paraoxon
treatment
.

The
best
effect
showed
BT
-
07
-
4M
,
obidoxime
,
TMB
-
4
and
BT
-
08
from
the
group
of
symmetric
oximes
,
and
Toxidin
,
BT
-
05
and
BT
-
03
from
asymmetric
compounds
.

The
reactivation
of
brain
AChE
inhibited
with
tabun
demonstrated
better
activity
of
new
compound
BT
-
07
-
4M
,
TMB
-
4
and
obidoxime
from
symmetric
oximes
,
and
BT
-
05
and
BT
-
03
possessing
asymmetric
structure
.

All
compounds
showed
low
activity
toward
inhibition
of
AChE
caused
by
dichlorvos
.

Comparison
of
two
main
structure
types
(
symmetric
/
asymmetric
)
showed
that
the
symmetric
compounds
reactivated
better
AChE
,
inhibited
with
this
OPC
,
than
asymmetric
ones
.

Role
of
organic
cation
/
carnitine
transporter
1
in
uptake
of
phenformin
and
inhibitory
effect
on
complex
I
respiration
in
mitochondria
.

Phenformin
causes
lactic
acidosis
in
clinical
situations
due
to
inhibition
of
mitochondrial
respiratory
chain
complex
I
.

It
is
reportedly
taken
up
by
hepatocytes
and
exhibits
mitochondrial
toxicity
in
the
liver
.

In
this
study
,
uptake
of
phenformin
and
[
(
14
)
C
]
tetraethylammonium
(
TEA
)
and
complex
I
inhibition
by
phenformin
were
examined
in
isolated
liver
and
heart
mitochondria
.

Uptake
of
phenformin
into
isolated
rat
liver
mitochondria
was
higher
than
that
into
heart
mitochondria
.

It
was
inhibited
by
several
cat
ionic
compounds
,
which
suggests
the
involvement
of
multispecific
transport
system
(
s
)
.

Similar
characteristics
were
also
observed
for
uptake
of
TEA
;
however
,
uptake
of
phenformin
into
mitochondria
of
organic
cation
/
carnitine
transporter
1
(
OCTN1
)
knockout
mice
was
lower
than
that
in
wild
-
type
mice
,
whereas
uptake
of
TEA
was
comparable
between
the
two
strains
,
suggesting
the
involvement
of
distinct
transport
mechanisms
for
these
two
cations
in
mitochondria
.

Inhibition
by
phenformin
of
oxygen
consumption
via
complex
I
respiration
in
isolated
rat
liver
mitochondria
was
greater
than
that
in
heart
mitochondria
,
whereas
inhibitory
effect
of
phenformin
on
complex
I
respiration
was
similar
in
inside
-
out
structured
submitochondrial
particles
prepared
from
rat
livers
and
hearts
.

Lactic
acidosis
provoked
by
iv
infusion
of
phenformin
was
weaker
in
octn1
(
-
/
-
)
mice
than
that
in
wild
-
type
mice
.

These
observations
suggest
that
uptake
of
phenformin
into
liver
mitochondria
is
at
least
partly
mediated
by
OCTN1
and
functionally
relevant
to
its
inhibition
potential
of
complex
I
respiration
.

This
study
was
,
thus
,
the
first
to
demonstrate
OCTN1
-
mediated
mitochondrial
transport
and
toxicity
of
biguanide
in
vivo
in
rodents
.

Rufinamide

in
a
model
of

BACKGROUND
:
Voltage

dysregulation
is
important
for
hyperexcitability
leading
to
pain
persistence
.

Sodium
channel
blockers
currently
used

are
poorly

.

Getting

We

the
behavioral

CONCLUSIONS
:
At
doses
alleviating

,
amitriptyline
showed
alteration
of
behavioral

possibly
related
to
either
alteration

both
.

Side
-
effects
and
drug

are
major
problems
with
drugs

as
amitriptyline
.

Rufinamide
seems
to
have
a
better

could
be
a
new
alternative
to
explore
for
the
treatment
of
neuropathic

The
Effects
of
Carbohydrate
,
Unsaturated
Fat
,
and
Protein
Intake
on
Measures
of
Insulin
Sensitivity
:
Results
from
the
OmniHeart
Trial
.

OBJECTIVE
Impaired
insulin
sensitivity
increases
the
risk
of
cardiovascular
disease
.

Although
calorie
restriction
and
weight
loss
increase
insulin
sensitivity
,
the
effects
of
modifying
macronutrient
composition
on
insulin
sensitivity
are
uncertain
.

The
purpose
of
this
study
is
to
determine
the
effects
on
insulin
sensitivity
of
a
carbohydrate
-
rich
diet
(
CARB
;
similar
to
the
Dietary

diet
)
,
a

,
and

RESEARCH
DESIGN
AND
METHODS
This
study
was
a
randomized
,
controlled
,
three
-
period
,
crossover
feeding
study
.

The
study
participants
were
164
individuals
with
prehypertension
or
stage
1
hypertension
without
diabetes
.

Diets
were
administered
for
6
weeks
each
,
with
a
washout
period
between
diets
of
2
-
4
weeks
.

Weight
was
held
constant
throughout
the
study
.

For
our
primary
outcome
,
we
calculated
the
quantitative
insulin
sensitivity
check
index
(
QUICKI
)
using
the
end
-
of

period
fasting
serum
glucose
and
insulin
.

QUICKI
is
a
validated
measure
of
insulin
sensitivity
.

The
primary
analyses
used
generalized
estimating
equations
.

RESULTS
At
baseline
,
mean
(

)
BMI
was
30
.
2
(

)
kg

,
and
mean
(

)
QUICKI
was

.

The
UNSAT
diet
increased
QUICKI
by
0
.
005
,
more
than
the
CARB
diet
(
P

)
.

PROT
had
no
significant
effect
compared
with
CARB
.

CONCLUSIONS
A
diet
that
partially
replaces
carbohydrate
with
unsaturated
fat
may
improve
insulin
sensitivity
in
a
population
at
risk
for
cardiovascular
disease
.

Given
the
well
-
recognized
challenges
of
sustaining
weight
loss
,
our
results
suggest
an
alternative
approach
for
improving
insulin
sensitivity
.

Vitamin
K2
covalently
binds
to
Bak
and
induces
Bak
-
mediated
apoptosis
.

Vitamin
K2
(
VK2
,
menaquinone
)
is
known
to
have
anticancer
activity
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
.

Although
its
effect
is
thought
to
be
mediated
,
at
least
in
part
,
by
the
induction
of
apoptosis
,
the
underlying
molecular
mechanism
remains
elusive
.

Here
,
we
identified
Bcl
-
2
antagonist
killer
1
(
Bak
)
as
a
molecular
target
of
VK2
-
induced
apoptosis
.

VK2
directly
interacts
with
Bak
and
induces
mitochondrial
-
mediated
apoptosis
.

Although
Bak
and
Bcl
-
2
-
associated
X
protein
(
Bax
)
,
another
member
of
the
Bcl
-
2
family
,
are
generally
thought
to
be
functionally
redundant
,
only
Bak
is
necessary
and
sufficient
for
VK2
-
induced
cytochrome
c
(
cyt
c
)
release
and
cell
death
.

Moreover
,
VK2
-
2
,
3
epoxide
,
an
intracellular
metabolite
of
VK2
,
was
shown
to
covalently
bind
to
the
cysteine
-
166
residue
of
Bak
.

Several
lines
of
evidence
suggested
that
the
covalent
attachment
of
VK2
is
critical
for
apoptosis
induction
.

Thus
this
study
reveals
a
specific
role
for
Bak
in
mitochondria
-
mediated
apoptosis
.

This
study
also
provides
insight
into
the
anticancer
effects
of
VK2
and
suggests
that
Bak
may
be
a
potential
target
of
cancer
therapy
.

trimethylation
during
active
transcription
.

Recent
studies
have
revealed
a
close
relationship
between
transcription
,
histone
modification
,
and
RNA
processing
.

In
fact
,
genome
-
wide
analyses
that
correlate
histone
marks
with
RNA
processing
signals
raise
the
possibility
that
specific
RNA
processing
factors
may
modulate
transcription
and
help
to
"
write
"
chromatin
marks
.

Here
we
show
that
the
nuclear
cap
binding
complex
(
CBC
)
directs
recruitment
of
transcription
elongation
factors
and
establishes
proper
histone
marks
during
active
transcription
.

A
directed
genetic
screen
revealed
that
deletion
of
either
subunit
of
the
CBC
confers
a
synthetic
growth
defect
when
combined
with
deletion
of
genes
encoding
either
Ctk2
or
Bur2
,
a
component
of
the
Saccharomyces
cerevisiae
ortholog
of
P
-
TEFb
.

The
CBC
physically
associates
with
these
complexes
to
recruit
them
during
transcription
and
mediates
phosphorylation
at
Ser
-
2
of
the
C
-
terminal
domain
(
CTD
)
of
RNA
polymerase
II
.

To
understand
how
these
interactions
influence
downstream
events
,
histone
H3K36me3
was
examined
,
and
we
demonstrate
that
CBCΔ
affects
proper
Set2
-
dependent
H3K36me3
.

Consistent
with
this
,
the
CBC
and
Set2
have
similar
effects
on
the
ability
to
rapidly
induce
and
sustain
activated
gene
expression
,
and
these
effects
are
distinct
from
other
histone
methyltransferases
.

This
work
provides
evidence
for
an
emerging
model
that
RNA
processing
factors
can
modulate
the
recruitment
of
transcription
factors
and
influence
histone
modification
during
elongation
.

Peptidyl
-
prolyl
cis
/
trans
-
isomerase
A1
(
Pin1
)
is
a
target
for
modification
by
lipid
electrophiles
.

Oxidation
of
membrane
phospholipids
is
associated
with
inflammation
,
neurodegenerative
disease
,
and
cancer
.

Oxyradical
damage
to
phospholipids
results
in
the
production
of
reactive
aldehydes
that
adduct
proteins
and
modulate
their
function
.

Hydroxynonenal
(
HNE
)
,
a
common
product
of
oxidative
damage
to

,
adducts
proteins
at
exposed
Cys
,
His
,
or
Lys
residues
.

Here
,
we
demonstrate
that
peptidyl
-
prolyl
cis
/
trans
-
isomerase
A1
(
Pin1
)
,
an
enzyme
that
catalyzes
the
conversion
of
the
peptide
bond
of
pSer
/
pThr
-
Pro
moieties
in
signaling
proteins
from
cis
to
trans
,
is
highly
susceptible
to
HNE
modification
.

Incubation
of
purified
Pin1
with
HNE
followed
by
MALDI
-
TOF
/
TOF
mass
spectrometry
resulted
in
detection
of
Michael
adducts
at
the
active
site
residues
His
-
157
and
Cys
-
113
.

Time
and
concentration
dependencies
indicate
that
Cys
-
113
is
the
primary
site
of
HNE
modification
.

Pin1
was
adducted
in
MDA
-
MB
-
231
breast
cancer
cells
treated
with

alkynyl

conjugation
with
biotin
followed
by
streptavidin
-
based
pulldown
and
Western
blotting
with
anti

Pin1
antibody
.

Furthermore
,
orbitrap
MS
data
support
the
adduction
of
Cys
-
113
in
the
Pin1
active
site
upon
HNE
treatment
of
MDA
-
MB
-
231
cells
.

siRNA
knockdown
of
Pin1
in
MDA
-
MB
-
231
cells
partially
protected
the
cells
from
HNE
-
induced
toxicity
.

Recent
studies
indicate
that
Pin1
is
an
important
molecular
target
for
the
chemopreventive
effects
of
green
tea
polyphenols
.

The
present
study
establishes
that
it
is
also
a
target
for
electrophilic
modification
by
products
of
lipid
peroxidation
.

Aberrant
transcription
of
the
LHCGR
gene
caused
by
a
mutation
in
exon
6A
leads
to
Leydig
cell
hypoplasia
type
II
.

The
luteinizing
hormone
/
chorionic
gonadotropin
receptor
(
LHCGR
)
is
essential
for
normal
male
sex
differentiation
.

Recently
,
the
additional
primate
-
specific
exon
6A
of
the
LHCGR
was
discovered
and
it
was
shown
to
act
as
regulatory
element
at
the
transcriptional
level
.

Compound
heterozygous
mutations
in
exon
6A
(
c
.
580
A
>
G
)
and
exon
11
(
c
.
1244T
>
C
)
were
identified
in
the
LHCGR
of
a
male
46
,
XY
patient
with
genital
malformation
.

Analysis
revealed
that
mutation
c
.
580A
>
G
in
exon
6A
affects
the
splicing
pattern
resulting
in
an
increase
of
transcripts
containing
the
internal
variants
of
exon
6A
prone
to
nonsense
-
mediated
decay
.

In
contrast
,
mutation
c
.
1244T
>
C
results
in
an
amino
acid
substitution
(
Ile415Thr
)
,
which
abolishes
signal
transduction
due
to
structural
changes
.

When
inherited
in
a
compound
heterozygous
fashion
these
mutations
result
in
Leydig
cell
hypoplasia
(
LCH
)
type
II
.

Thus
this
study
provides
proof
that
mutations
causing
aberrant
transcription
can
impair
receptor
function
and
thereby
be
causative
of
LCH
.

Age
dependent
differences
in
the
regulation
of
hippocampal
steroid
hormones
and
receptor
genes
:
relations
to
motivation
and
cognition
in
male
rats
.

Estrogen
and
estrogenic
functions
are
age
-
dependently
involved
in
the
modulation
of
learning
,
memory
and
mood
in
female
humans
and
animals
.

However
,
the
investigation
of
estrogenic
effects
in
males
has
been
largely
neglected
.

Therefore
,
we
investigated
the
hippocampal
gene
expression
of
estrogen
receptors
α
and
β
(
ERα
,
β
)
in
8
-
week
-
old
,
12
-
week
-
old
and
24
-
week
-
old
male
rats
.

To
control
for
possible
interactions
between
the
expression
of
the
estrogen
receptor
genes
and
other
learning
-
related
steroid
receptors
,
androgen
receptors
(
AR
)
,
corticosterone
-
binding
glucocorticoid
receptors
(
GR
)
and
mineralocorticoid
receptors
(
MR
)
were
also
measured
.

Furthermore
,
the
concentrations
of
the
ligands
17β
-
estradiol
,
testosterone
and
corticosterone
were
measured
.

The
spatial
training
was
conducted
in
a
hole
-
board
.

The
8
-
week
-
old
rats
exhibited
higher
levels
of
general
activity
and
exploration
during
the
training
and
performed
best
with
respect
to
spatial
learning
and
memory
,
whereas
no
difference
was
found
between
the
12
-
week
-
old
and
24
-
week
-
old
rats
.

The
trained
8
-
week
-
old
rats
exhibited
increased
gene
expression
of
ERα
compared
with
the
untrained
rats
in
this
age
group
as
well
as
the
trained
12
-
week
-
old
and
24
-
week
-
old
rats
.

The
concentrations
of
estradiol
and
testosterone
,
however
,
were
generally
higher
in
the
24
-
week
-
old
rats
than
in
the
8
-
week
-
old
and
12
-
week
-
old
rats
.

The
ERα
mRNA
concentrations
correlated
positively
with
behavior
that
indicate
general
learning
motivation
.

These
results
suggest
a
specific
role
of
ERα
in
the
age
-
related
differences
in
motivation
and
subsequent
success
in
the
task
.

Thus
,
estrogen
and
estrogenic
functions
may
play
a
more
prominent
role
in
young
male
behavior
and
development
than
has
been
previously
assumed
.

Binding
of
dimemorfan
to
sigma
-
1
receptor
and
its
anticonvulsant
and
locomotor
effects
in
mice
,
compared
with
dextromethorphan
and
dextrorphan
.

Dextromethorphan
(
(
+
)
-
3
-
methoxy
-
N
-
methylmorphinan
,
DM
)
has
been
shown
to
have
both
anticonvulsant
and
neuroprotective
effects
.

The
mechanisms
of
these
CNS
effects
of
DM
have
been
suggested
to
be
associated
with
the
low
-
affinity
,
noncompetitive
,
N
-
methyl
-
d
-
aspartate
(
NMDA
)
antagonism
of
DM
and
/
or
the
high
-
affinity
DM
/
sigma
receptors
.

DM
is
largely
O
-
demethylated
into
the
phencyclidine
(
PCP
)
-
like
compound
dextrorphan
(
DR
)
,
which
may
limit
its
therapeutic
use
by
producing
PCP
-
like
adverse
effects
,
such
as
hyperlocomotion
.

Dimemorfan
(
(
+
)
-
3
-
methyl
-
N
-
methylmorphinan
,
DF
)
,
an
analog
of
DM
,
which
has
been
safely
used
as
an
antitussive
for
more
than
20
years
,
is
also
known
not
to
form
DR
.

This
study
therefore
characterized
the
binding
of
DF
to
the
sigma
receptors
and
NMDA
-
linked
PCP
sites
and
examined
the
anticonvulsant
as
well
as
locomotor
effects
of
DF
in
mice
in
comparison
with
those
of
DM
and
DR
.

We
found
that
DF
,
DM
,
and
DR
were
relative
high
-
affinity
ligands
at
sigma
-
1
receptors
(
Ki
=
151
,
205
,
144
nM
,
respectively
)
while
all
of
them
were
with
low
affinity
at
sigma
-
2
receptors
(
Ki
=
4
-
11
microM
)
.

Only
DR
exhibited
moderate
affinity
for
PCP
sites
(
Ki
=
0
.
9
microM
)
,
whereas
DF
(
Ki
=
17
microM
)
and
DM
(
Ki
=
7
microM
)
were
much
less
active
.

DF
,
DM
and
DR
produced
prominent
anticonvulsant
effects
in
mice
as
measured
by
the
supramaximal
electroshock
test
with
comparable
potency
(
ED50
approximately
70
micromol
/
kg
,
i
.
p
.
)
.

At
the
tested
doses
(
20
-
260
micromol
/
kg
,
i
.
p
.
)
,
DM
and
DR
exhibited
biphasic
effects
on
the
locomotor
activity
whereas
DF
produced
a
consistent
dose
-
dependent
decrease
.

These
results
revealed
that
,
unlike
DM
and
DR
,
DF
did
not
cause
a
PCP
-
like
hyperlocomotion
adverse
effect
that
is
parallel
with
the
PCP
sites
binding
data
.

Furthermore
,
since
they
have
equipotent
anticonvulsant
effects
and
similar
binding
affinities
to
sigma
-
1
receptors
,
the
very
low
affinity
of
DF
at
PCP
sites
may
suggest
that
acting
on
the
PCP
sites
may
not
be
the
requisite
for
mediating
the
anticonvulsant
activity
of
these
DM
analogs
.

With
the
history
of
safety
and
relative
less
adverse
effects
,
DF
appears
to
be
worth
further
studying
on
its
CNS
effects
other
than
the
antitussive
effect
.

Angiotensin

receptor
blockade
in
normotensive
subjects
:
A
direct
comparison
of
three
AT1
receptor
antagonists
.

Use
of
angiotensin
(
Ang
)
II
AT1
receptor
antagonists
for
treatment
of
hypertension
is
rapidly
increasing
,
yet
direct
comparisons
of
the
relative
efficacy
of
antagonists
to
block
the
renin
-
angiotensin
system
in
humans
are
lacking
.

In
this
study
,
the
Ang
II
receptor
blockade
induced
by
the
recommended
starting
dose
of
3
antagonists
was
evaluated
in
normotensive
subjects
in
a
double
-
blind
,
placebo
-
controlled
,
randomized
,
4

study
.

At
1

week
intervals
,
12
subjects
received
a
single
dose
of
losartan
(
50
mg
)
,
valsartan
(
80
mg
)
,
irbesartan
(
150
mg
)
,
or
placebo
.

Blockade
of
the
renin
-
angiotensin
system
was
assessed
before
and
4
,
24
,
and
30
hours
after
drug
intake
by
3
independent
methods
:
inhibition
of
the
blood
pressure
response
to
exogenous
Ang
II
,
in

Ang
II
receptor
assay
,
and
reactive
changes
in
plasma
Ang

levels
.

At
4
hours
,
losartan
blocked
43
%
of
the
Ang
II
-
induced
systolic
blood
pressure
increase
;
valsartan
,
51
%
;
and
irbesartan
,
88
%
(
P
<
0
.
01
between
drugs
)
.

The
effect
of
each
drug
declined
with
time
.

At
24
hours
,
a
residual
effect
was
found
with
all
3
drugs
,
but
at
30
hours
,
only
irbesartan
induced
a
marked
,
significant
blockade
versus
placebo
.

Similar
results
were
obtained
when
Ang
II
receptor
blockade
was
assessed
with
an
in
vitro
receptor
assay
and
by
the
reactive
rise
in
plasma
Ang
II
levels
.

This
study
thus
demonstrates
that
the
first
administration
of
the
recommended
starting
dose
of
irbesartan
induces
a
greater
and
longer
lasting
Ang
II
receptor
blockade
than
that
of
valsartan
and
losartan
in
normotensive
subjects
.

only
be
accurately

we
determined
the

In

,
prolonged

A
multicenter
,

of
argatroban
versus

(
TPA
)
in
acute
myocardial

:
myocardial

with
novastan
and
TPA
(
MINT

study
.

OBJECTIVES
:
This
study
examined
the
effect
of
a
small
-
molecule
,
direct
thrombin
inhibitor
,
argatroban
,
on
reperfusion
induced
by
tissue
plasminogen
activator
(
TPA
)
in
patients
with
acute
myocardial
infarction
(
AMI
)
.

BACKGROUND
:
Thrombin
plays
a
crucial
role
in
thrombosis
and
thrombolysis
.

In
vitro
and
in
vivo
studies
have
shown
that
argatroban
has
advantages
over
heparin
for
the
inhibition
of
clot
-
bound
thrombin
and
for
the
enhancement
of
thrombolysis
with
TPA
.

METHODS
:
One
hundred
and
twenty
-
five
patients
with
AMI
within
6
h
were
randomized
to
heparin
,
low

argatroban
or

in

The
primary

point
was
the

RESULTS
:
TIMI

was
achieved
in

.

In
patients

CONCLUSIONS
:
Argatroban
,
as
compared
with
heparin
,
appears
to
enhance
reperfusion
with
TPA
in
patients
with
AMI
,
particularly
in
those
patients
with
delayed
presentation
.

The
incidences
of
major
bleeding
and
adverse
clinical
outcome
were
lower
in
the
patients
receiving
argatroban
.

Mechanistic
differences
of
various
AT1
-
receptor
blockers
in
isolated
vessels
of
different
origin
.

The
functional
inhibitory
characteristics
of
the
angiotensin
II
type
1
receptor
blockers
(
ARB
)
candesartan
;
irbesartan
;
and
losartan
and
its
active
metabolite
EXP
3174
(
EXP
)
were
studied
in
rabbit
aortic
strips
and
rat
portal
vein
preparations
in
vitro
.

Moreover
,
plasma
-
protein
binding
was
determined
,
and
the
binding
was
high
(
>
98
.
5
%
)
for
all
ARBs
.

These
values
were
needed
to
relate
the
concentrations
of
the
ARBs
used
in
vitro
to
the
nonprotein
bound
concentrations
in
clinical
use
.

In
both
vascular
preparations
,
candesartan
caused
a
marked
decrease
in
the
maximal
contractile
response
of
the
angiotensin
II
(
Ang
II
)
concentration
-
response
curve
.

Losartan
,
EXP
,
and
irbesartan
caused
a
rightward
parallel
shift
without
any
major
effects
on
the
maximal
response
to
Ang
II
.

The
inhibitory
effect
of
candesartan
developed
slowly
(
maximal
effect
after
>
30
minutes
)
and
lasted
>
2
hours
despite
repeated
washing
of
the
vessels
.

The
effect
of
losartan
,
irbesartan
,
and
EXP
had
a
faster
onset
,
and
most
of
the
inhibitory
effect
disappeared
after
washing
.

The
duration
of
the
inhibitory
effects
of
the
ARBs
were
not
related
to
lipophilicity
of
the
compounds
.

Cooling
of
the
rat
portal
vein
preparations
to
4
degrees
C
before
administration
of
candesartan
prevented
the
persistent
inhibition
of
Ang
II
response
seen
at
37
degrees
C
.

For
the
other
ARBs
studied
,
the
magnitude
of
inhibition
and
the
speed
of
recovery
of
the
Ang
II
response
were
independent
of
the
incubation
temperature
before
washing
.

In
addition
,
when
candesartan
was
given
to
conscious
rats
,
the
inhibitory
effect
on
Ang
II
-
induced
blood
pressure
responses
persisted
during
the
24
-
hour
period
despite
nondetectable
plasma
concentrations
of
candesartan
at
24
hours
.

It
is
concluded
that
functional
inhibitory
characteristics
of
candesartan
differ
from
those
of
the
other
ARBs
tested
.

At
clinically
relevant
concentrations
,
candesartan
is
an
insurmountable
and
long
-
lasting
antagonist
of
the
vascular
contractile
responses
to
Ang
II
.

We
evaluated
whether

of
meloxicam
are
associated
with
selective
inhibition
of
monocyte
cyclooxygenase
(
COX
)
-

.

Concentration

were
obtained
in

design
.

Before
dosing
and
24
h
after
the
seventh
dose
of
each
regimen
,
heparinized
whole
blood
samples
were
incubated
with
lipopolysaccharide
(
10
microgram
/
ml
)
for
24
h
at
37
degrees
C
,
and
prostaglandin
E2
was
measured
in
plasma
as
an
index
of
monocyte
COX
-
2
activity
.

The
production
of
thromboxane
B2
in
whole
blood
allowed
to
clot
at
37
degrees
C
for
60
min
was
assessed
as
an
index
of
platelet
COX
-
1
activity
.

The
administration
of
placebo
did
not
significantly
affect
plasma
prostaglandin
E2
(

.

In

,
the

of

of
meloxicam
caused

reductions

%
,
respectively
,
and
in

by

%
and

,
respectively
.

Although
the
IC50
value
of
meloxicam
for
inhibition
of
COX
-
1
was
10
-
fold
higher
than
the
IC50
value
of
COX

2
in

,
this
biochemical
selectivity
was
inadequate
to
clearly
separate
the
effects

while

These

Entacapone
.

A
review
of
its
use
in
Parkinson
'
s
disease
.

UNLABELLED
:
Entacapone
is
a
potent
and
specific
peripheral
catechol
-
O
-
methyltransferase
(
COMT
)
inhibitor
.

It
has
been
shown
to
improve
the
clinical
benefits
of
levodopa
plus
an
aromatic
L
-
amino
acid
decarboxylase
inhibitor
(
AADC
)
when
given
to
patients
with
Parkinson
'
s
disease
and
end
-
of
-
dose
deterioration
in
the
response
to
levodopa
(
the
'
wearing
off
'
phenomenon
)
.

The
efficacy
of
entacapone
is
currently
being
assessed
in
patients
with
stable
Parkinson
'
s
disease
.

In
2
well
conducted
trials
of
6
months
'
duration
and
smaller
short
term
studies
,
treatment
with
entacapone
(
200
mg
with
each
dose
of
levodopa
/
AADC
inhibitor
)
was
associated
with
significant
increases
in
daily
'
on
'
time
and
decreases
in
'
off
'
time
.

Changes
in
Unified
Parkinson
'
s
Disease
Rating
Scale
(
UPDRS
)
scores
concurred
with
changes
in
'
on
'
and
'
off
'
times
:
entacapone
improved
total
,
activities
of
daily
living
and
motor
function
scores
,
but
it
had
no
effect
on
mentation
scores
.

Entacapone
also
provided
benefits
when
given
with
controlled
release
levodopa
/
AADC
inhibitor
or
with
standard
levodopa
/
AADC
inhibitor
and
selegiline
in
small
trials
.

Dopaminergic
events
,
including
dyskinesia
and
nausea
,
are
among
the
most
common
events
with
entacapone
,
and
are
related
to
the
drug
'
s
ability
to
potentiate
the
effects
of
levodopa
.

Diarrhoea
,
abdominal
pain
,
constipation
and
urine
discolouration
are
the
most
common
nondopaminergic
events
,
although
the
latter
event
is
the
only
one
to
occur
consistently
more
frequently
with
entacapone
than
with
placebo
.

However
,
adverse
events
of
any
type
infrequently
led
to
study
discontinuation
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
The
efficacy
and
tolerability
of
entacapone
administered
with
levodopa
/
AADC
inhibitor
have
not
yet
been
compared
with
those
of
other
strategies
for
the
treatment
of
Parkinson
'
s
disease
.

However
,
once
the
decision
to
initiate
levodopa
therapy
has
been
made
,
studies
generally
support
the
use
of
entacapone
as
an

5
-
hydroxytryptamine
evokes
endothelial
nitric
oxide
synthase
activation
in
bovine
aortic
endothelial
cell
cultures
.

Activation
of
endothelial
nitric
oxide
synthase
(
eNOS
)
results
in
the
production
of
nitric
oxide
(
NO
)
that
mediates
the
vasorelaxing
properties
of
endothelial
cells
.

The
goal
of
this
project
was
to
address
the
possibility
that
5
-
hydroxytryptamine
(
5
-
HT
)
stimulates
eNOS
activity
in
bovine
aortic
endothelial
cell
(
BAEC
)
cultures
.

Here
,
we
tested
the
hypothesis
that
5

HT
receptors
mediate
eNOS
activation
by
measuring
agonist

stimulated
[

]
L

citrulline
(
[

)
formation
in
BAEC
cultures
.

We
found
that
5

HT
stimulated
the
conversion
of
[

L

arginine
(
[

L

)
to
[

,
indicating

were

and

.

Maximal

were
observed
within
10
min
following

.

These
responses
were
effectively
blocked
by
the

,
isamoltane
,
the
5

Pretreatment

with
pertussis
toxin
(
PTX
;

ng

)
for
16
hr
resulted
in
significant
inhibition
of
the
agonist

stimulated
eNOS
activity
,
indicating
the
involvement
of
Gi
proteins
.

These
findings
lend
evidence
of
a
5
-
HT1B
receptor
/
eNOS
pathway
,
accounting
in
part
for
the
activation
of
eNOS
by
5
-
HT
.

Further
investigation
is
needed
to
determine
the
role
of
other
vascular
5

receptors
in
the
stimulation
of
eNOS
activity
.

Caffeine
inhibits
the
checkpoint
kinase
ATM
.

The
basis
of
many
anti
-
cancer
therapies
is
the
use
of
genotoxic
agents
that
damage
DNA
and
thus
kill
dividing
cells
.

Agents
that
cause
cells
to
override
the
DNA
-
damage
checkpoint
are
predicted
to
sensitize
cells
to
killing
by
genotoxic
agents
.

They
have
therefore
been
sought
as
adjuncts
in
radiation
therapy
and
chemotherapy
.

One
such
compound
,
caffeine
,
uncouples
cell
-
cycle
progression
from
the
replication
and
repair
of
DNA
[
1
]
[
2
]
.

Caffeine
therefore
servers
as
a
model
compound
in
establishing
the
principle
that
agents
that
override
DNA
-
damage
checkpoints
can
be
used
to
sensitize
cells
to
the
killing
effects
of
genotoxic
drugs
[

]
.

But
despite
more
than
20
years
of
use
,
the
molecular
mechanisms
by
which
caffeine
affects
the
cell
cycle
and
checkpoint
responses
have
not
been
identified
.

We
investigated
the
effects
of
caffeine
on
the
G2
/
M
DNA
-
damage
checkpoint
in
human
cells
.

We
report
that
the
radiation
-
induced
activation
of
the
kinase
Cds1
[
4
]
(
also
known
as
Chk2
[
5
]
)
is
inhibited
by
caffeine
in
vivo
and
that
ATM
kinase
activity
is
directly
inhibited
by
caffeine
in
vitro
.

Inhibition
of
ATM
provides
a
molecular
explanation
of
the
attenuation
of
DNA

damage
checkpoint
responses
and
for
the
increased
radiosensitivity
of
caffeine

Serotonin
transporter
production
and
degradation
rates
:
studies
with
RTI
-
76
.

The
objective
of
this
study
was
to
examine
the
turnover
of
the
serotonin
transporter
(
SERT
)
by
determining
its
production
rate
(
r
)
,
degradation
rate
constant
(
k
)
and
half

recovery
(

.

The
turnover
of
SERT
was
determined
from
the
rate
of
recovery
of
binding
after
administration
of
RTI

,
an
irreversible
inhibitor
of

.

In

Citalopram
protected
against

Following

of

76
,
there
was
a

reduction
(
-
60

)
of
SERT
binding
in
hippocampus

without

.

SERT

densities
recovered
over
several
days
,
reaching
control
levels
by
day

.

The

curve
fit
the
standard
model
of
protein
synthesis
and

.

The
turnover
parameters
of
SERT
were
determined
in

,
regions
that
receive
serotonergic
innervation
from
the
dorsal
and
median
midbrain
raphe
nuclei
,
respectively
.

In

was

;
and
the
half

life
of
the
SERT

The
values
in
the

were
similar
.

The

correlated
highly
(

Cannabis
and
cannabinoids
:
pharmacology
and
rationale
for
clinical
use
.

It
is
now
known
that
there
are
at
least
two
types
of
cannabinoid
receptors
.

These
are
CB1
receptors
,
present
mainly
on
central
and
peripheral
neurones
,
and
CB2
receptors
,
present
mainly
on
immune
cells
.

Endogenous
cannabinoid
receptor
agonists
(
'
endocannabinoids
'
)
have
also
been
identified
.

The
discovery
of
this
'
endogenous
cannabinoid
system
'
has
led
to
the
development
of
selective
CB1
and
CB2
receptor
ligands
and
fueled
renewed
interest
in
the
clinical
potential
of
cannabinoids
.

Two
cannabinoid
CB1
receptor
agonists
are
already
used
clinically
,
as
antiemetics
or
as
appetite
stimulants
.

These
are
D
9
-
tetrahydrocannabinol
(
THC
)
and
nabilone
.

Other
possible
uses
for
CB1
receptor
agonists
include
the
suppression
of
muscle
spasm
/
spasticity
associated
with
multiple
sclerosis
or
spinal
cord
injury
,
the
relief
of
chronic
pain
and
the
management
of
glaucoma
and
bronchial
asthma
.

CB1
receptor
antagonists
may
also
have
clinical
applications
,
e
.
g
.
as
appetite
suppressants
and
in
the
management
of
schizophrenia
or
disorders
of
cognition
and
memory
.

So
too
may
CB2
receptor
ligands
and
drugs
that
activate
cannabinoid
receptors
indirectly
by
augmenting
endocannabinoid
levels
at
cannabinoid
receptors
.

When
taken
orally
,
THC
seems
to
undergo
variable
absorption
and
to
have
a
narrow
'
therapeutic
window
'
(
dose
range
in
which
it
is
effective
without
producing
significant
unwanted
effects
)
.

This
makes
it
difficult
to
predict
an
oral
dose
that
will
be
both
effective
and
tolerable
to
a
patient
and
indicates
a
need
for
better
cannabinoid
formulations
and
modes
of
administration
.

For
the
therapeutic
potential
of
cannabis
or
CB1
receptor
agonists
to
be
fully
exploited
,
it
will
be
important
to
establish
objectively
and
conclusively
(
a
)
whether
these
agents
have
efficacy
against
selected
symptoms
that
is
of
clinical
significance
and
,
if
so
,
whether
the
benefits
outweigh
the
risks
,
(
b
)
whether
cannabis
has
therapeutic
advantages
over
individual
cannabinoids
,
(
c
)
whether
there
is
a
need
for
additional
drug
treatments
to
manage
any
of
the
disorders
against
which
cannabinoids
are
effective
,
and
(
d
)
whether
it
will
be
possible
to
develop
drugs
that
have
reduced
psychotropic
activity
and
yet
retain
the
ability
to
act
through
CB1
receptors
to
produce
their
sought
-
after
effects
.

Pharmacological
properties
of
angiotensin
II
receptor
antagonists
.

The
availability
of
selective
,
potent
,
orally
active
and
long
acting
nonpeptide
angiotensin
II
type
1
(
AT1
)
receptor
antagonists
has
provided
the
opportunity
to
obtain
the
benefits
of
selectively
blocking
the
renin
-
angiotensin
-
aldosterone
system
at
the
level
of
the
AT1
receptor
that
mediates
most
,
if
not
all
,
of
the
important
actions
of
angiotensin
II
,
and
avoid
the
nonspecificity
of
the
angiotensin
I
converting
enzyme
inhibitors
.

Losartan
was
the
first
,
but
by
no
means
remained
the
only
,
AT1
receptor
antagonist
.

Numerous
other
'
sartans
'
have
emerged
in
the
past
several
years
and
successfully
completed
clinical
development
.

With
the
exception
of
eprosartan
,
all
others
,
ie
,
candesartan
,
irbesartan
,
saprisartan
,
tasosartan
,
telmisartan
,
valsartan
and
zolasartan
,
are
based
on
medications
of
losartan
'
s
prototypical
chemical
structure
.

Among
the
current
AT1
receptor
antagonists
,
the
rank
order
of
the
relative
binding
affinities
(
highest
affinity
=
1
)
is
:
candesartan
1
,
telmisartan
10
,
E3174
(
the
active
metabolite
of
losartan
)
10
,
tasosartan
20
,
losartan
50
,
eprosartan
100
and
the
prodrug
candesartan
cilexetil
280
.

The
mode
of
(
functional
)
AT1
receptor
antagonism
has
been
characterized
as
surmountable
/
noncompetitive
(
losartan
,
tasosartan
,
eprosartan
)
or
insurmountable
/
noncompetitive
(
candesartan
,
saprisartan
,
zolasartan
,
irbesartan
,
valsartan
,
telmisartan
,
E3174
)
.

It
is
very
likely
that
slow
dissociation
kinetics
from
the
AT1
receptor
underlie
insurmountable
antagonism
.

However
,
competitive
or
noncompetitive
antagonism
does
not
determine
the
antihypertensive
efficacy
,
but
the
slow
off
-
rate
may
extend
the
occupancy
of
the
AT1
receptor
and
thereby
lengthen
the
duration
of
the
antihypertensive
effect
.

Comparison
of
chemotherapy
with
chemohormonal
therapy
as
first
-
line
therapy
for
metastatic
,
hormone
-
sensitive
breast
cancer
:
An
Eastern
Cooperative
Oncology
Group
study
.

PURPOSE
:
Although
hormonal
therapy
represents
standard
therapy
for
metastatic
hormone
-
sensitive
disease
,
many
patients
receive
initial
chemotherapy
because
of
the
location
,
bulk
,
or
aggressiveness
of
their
disease
.

It
is
uncertain
whether
simultaneous
hormonal
therapy
provides
additional
benefit
compared
with
chemotherapy
alone
.

Eastern
Cooperative
Oncology
Group
trial
E3186
was
initiated
to
explore
this
question
.

PATIENTS
AND
METHODS
:
Between
January
1988
and
December
1992
,
231
patients
with
estrogen
receptor
(
ER
)
-
positive
or
ER
-
unknown
metastatic
breast
cancer
were
randomized
to
receive
either
chemotherapy
(
cyclophosphamide
,
doxorubicin
,
and
fluorouracil
inverted
question
markCAF
)
or
chemohormonal
therapy
(
CAF
plus
tamoxifen
and
Halotestin
inverted
question
markfluoxymesterone
;
Pharmacia
-
Upjohn
,
Kalamazoo
,
MI
inverted
question
markCAFTH
)
as
front
-
line
therapy
for
metastatic
breast
cancer
.

Patients
who
experienced
a
complete
response
to
induction
therapy
either
received
or
did
not
receive
maintenance
cyclophosphamide
,
methotrexate
,
fluorouracil
,
prednisone
,
and
TH
as
a
secondary
randomization
.

RESULTS
:
The
response
rates
(
complete
response
and
partial
response
)
of
patients
who
received
CAF
and
CAFTH
were
similar
(
69
.
2
%
v
68
.
9
%
,
respectively
;
P
=
.
99
)
.

Time
to
treatment
failure
(
TTF
)
was
slightly
longer
for
patients
who
received
chemohormonal
therapy
compared
with
chemotherapy
alone
patients
(
13
.
4
months
v
10
.
3
months
,
respectively
;
P
=
.
087
)
,
and
TTF
was
significantly
longer
in
ER
-
positive
compared
with
ER
-
negative
patients
(
17
.
4
months
v
10
.
3
months
,
respectively
;
P
=
.
048
)
.

However
,
ER
status
had
no
effect
on
overall
survival
(
30
.
0
months
for
CAF
v
29
.
3
months
for
CAFTH
)
.

CONCLUSION
:
In
patients
with
potentially
hormone
-
sensitive
metastatic
breast
cancer
,
chemohormonal
therapy
prolongs
TTF
for
ER
-
positive
patients
without
improving
overall
survival
.

Characterization
and
partial
purification
of
microsomal
NAD
(
P
)
H
:
quinone
oxidoreductases
.

Quinone
oxidoreductases
are
flavoproteins
that
catalyze
two
-
electron
reduction
and
detoxification
of
quinones
.

This
leads
to
the
protection
of
cells
against
toxicity
,
mutagenicity
,
and
cancer
due
to
exposure
to
environmental
and
synthetic
quinones
and
its
precursors
.

Two
cytosolic
forms
of
quinone
oxidoreductases
[
NAD
(
P
)
H
:
quinone
oxidoreductase
1
(
NQO1
)
and
NRH
:
quinone
oxidoreductase
2
(
NQO2
)
]
were
previously
identified
,
purified
,
and
cloned
.

A
role
of
cytosolic
NQO1
in
protection
of
cells
from
oxidative
stress
,
cytotoxicity
,
and
mutagenicity
of
quinones
was
established
.

Currently
,
we
have
characterized
and
partially
purified
the
NQO
activity
from
rat
liver
microsomes
.

This
activity
was
designated
as
microsomal
NQO
(
mNQO
)
.

The
mNQO
activity
showed
significantly
higher
affinity
for
NADH
than
NADPH
as
electron
donors
and
catalyzed
reduction
of
2
,
6
-
dichlorophenolindophenol
and
menadione
.

The
mNQO
activity
was
insensitive
to
dicoumarol
,
a
potent
inhibitor
of
cytosolic
NQO1
.

Western
analysis
of
microsomal
proteins
revealed
29
-
and
18
-
kDa
bands
that
cross
-
reacted
with
polyclonal
antibodies
raised
against
cytosolic
NQO1
.

The
mNQO
activity
was
partially
purified
by
solubilization
of
microsomes
with
detergent
Chaps
,
ammonium
sulfate
fractionation
,
and
DEAE
-
Sephacel
column
chromatography
.

The
microsomal
mNQO
proteins
are
expected
to
provide
additional
protection
after
cytosolic
NQOs
against
quinone
toxicity
and
mutagenicity
.

Opioid
activity
profiles
indicate
similarities
between
the
nociceptin
/
orphanin
FQ
and
opioid
receptors
.

Nociceptin
(
orphanin
FQ
)
is
the
recently
discovered
peptide
agonist
for
the
orphan
receptor
opioid
receptor
-
like
1
(
ORL1
)
.

Despite
the
high
sequence
homology
between
ORL1
and
the
opioid
receptors
,
most
opioids
lack
affinity
for
the
nociceptin
receptor
.

The
affinity
and
functional
profile
of
opioids
possessing
activity
at
the
nociceptin
receptor
was
determined
using
[
3H
]
nociceptin
and
nociceptin
-
stimulated
[
35S
]
GTPgammaS
binding
.

The
mu
-
opioid
receptor
-
selective
agonist
lofentanil
potently
and
competitively
displaced
[
3H
]
nociceptin
at
rat
brain
receptors
(
IC
(
50
)
62
nM
)
.

Lofentanil
exhibited
full
agonism
for
enhancement
of
[
35S
]
GTPgammaS
binding
to
human
recombinant
ORL1
receptors
(
EC
(
50
)
50
nM
)
.

The
related
piperidines
ohmefentanyl
and
sufentanil
and
the
nonselective
opioid
receptor
agonist
etorphine
were
less
potent
nociceptin
receptor
agonists
.

The
kappa
(
1
)
+
kappa
(
3
)
-
opioid
receptor
agonist
/
mu
-
opioid
receptor
antagonist
naloxone
benzoylhydrazone
was
a
pure
antagonist
at
both
rat
brain
and
human
ORL1
receptors
.

The
nonselective
opioid
receptor
partial
agonist
buprenorphine
and
the
nonselective
opioid
receptor
antagonist
(
-
)
-
quadazocine
exhibited
pure
antagonism
at
rat
brain
receptors
,
but
displayed
partial
agonism
at
human
ORL1
receptors
.

Thus
,
opioids
displaying
full
agonism
at
the
nociceptin
receptor
are
also
opioid
receptor
agonists
,
whereas
opioids
that
are
antagonists
or
partial
agonists
at
the
nociceptin
receptor
show
antagonism
or
partial
agonism
at
opioid
receptors
.

In
addition
,
the
stereospecificity
required
at
opioid
receptors
appears
to
be
retained
at
the
nociceptin
receptor
,
since
(
+
)
-
quadazocine
is
inactive
at
both
receptors
.

These
findings
illustrate
the
structural
and
functional
homology
of
the
opioid
recognition
site
on
these
two
receptor
classes
and
suggest
that
opioids
may
provide
leads
for
the
design
of
nonpeptide
nociceptin
receptor
agonists
and
antagonists
lacking
affinity
for
the
classical
opioid
receptors
.

Effects
of
long
-
term
administration
of
UFT
plus
leucovorin
on
colorectal
tumors
induced
with
1
,

-
dimethylhydrazine
in
rats
.

Thymidylate
synthase
and
thymidine
kinase
are
key
enzymes
involved
in
the
de
novo
and
salvage
pathways
for
pyrimidine
nucleotide
synthesis
,
respectively
.

Thymidylate
synthase
is
inhibited
by
5
-
fluorodeoxyuridine
monophosphate
,
forming
an
inactive
ternary
complex
with
intracellular
folate
.

We
investigated
the
effects
of
1
-
(
2
-
tetrahydrofuryl
)
-
5
-
FU
plus
uracil
(
UFT
)
with
or
without
leucovorin
on
1
,
2
-
dimethylhydrazine
-
induced
rat
colorectal
carcinomas
.

Thirty
-
week
administration
of
UFT
with
or
without
leucovorin
markedly
suppressed
both
colorectal
carcinogenesis
and
tumor
growth
,
resulted
in
the
increase
of
thymidylate
synthase
inhibition
and
the
decrease
of
thymidine
kinase
activity
in
the
tumor
cells
.

These
results
indicate
that
the
combination
of
UFT
with
leucovorin
could
be
useful
in
the
development
of
pre
-
and
post
-
operative
adjuvant
chemotherapy
programs
.

Antizyme
inhibitor
is
rapidly
induced
in
growth
-
stimulated
mouse
fibroblasts
and
releases
ornithine
decarboxylase
from
antizyme
suppression
.

Ornithine
decarboxylase
(
ODC
)
catalyses
the
first
step
in
the
synthesis
of
the
polyamines
putrescine
,
spermidine
and
spermine
.

The
polyamines
are
essential
for
cell
growth
,
but
at
elevated
levels
they
may
be
tumorigenic
,
toxic
,
or
may
induce
apoptosis
.

Therefore
,
ODC
activity
is
highly
regulated
.

It
is
induced
when
cells
are
stimulated
to
grow
,
and
it
is
subjected
to
feedback
inhibition
by
the
polyamines
.

By
causing
ribosomal
frameshifting
,
polyamines
induce
the
synthesis
of
antizyme
,
a
23
-
kDa
protein
,
which
binds
to
ODC
,
inhibits
its
activity
and
promotes
its
degradation
by
the
26
S
proteasome
.

Antizyme
,
in
turn
,
is
inhibited
by
antizyme
inhibitor
(
AZI
)
.

We
describe
the
cloning
of
a
mouse
AZI
cDNA
,
encoding
a
protein
with
high
homology
to
mouse
ODC
.

Using
purified
recombinant
proteins
,
we
show
that
AZI
(
which
has
no
ODC
activity
)
can
release
enzymically
active
ODC
from
antizyme
suppression
in
vitro
.

We
also
show
that
ODC
reactivation
takes
place
in
mouse
fibroblasts
upon
transient
transfection
with
an
AZI
-
expressing
plasmid
construct
.

Finally
we
demonstrate
that
the
AZI
mRNA
content
of
mouse
fibroblasts
increases
significantly
within
an
hour
of
growth
stimulation
,
i
.
e
.
much
earlier
than
ODC
transcripts
.

Our
results
indicate
that
induction
of
AZI
synthesis
may
represent
a
means
of
rescuing
ODC
molecules
that
have
been
inactivated
and
tagged
for
degradation
by
antizyme
,
when
culture
conditions
improve
and
polyamine
production
is
needed
for
cell
growth
and
proliferation
.

Pharmacological

Bronchial
epithelial
cells
play
an
important
role
in
amplifying
and
perpetuating
airway
inflammation
and
may
be
a
target
for
inhaled
steroids
.

We
have
characterized
glucocorticoid
receptors
in
primary
human
bronchial
epithelial
cells
.

Northern
and
western
blot
analyses
demonstrated
the
expression
of
glucocorticoid
receptor
mRNA
and
protein
,
respectively
,
in
primary
bronchial
epithelial
cells
.

The
activity
of
these
receptors
was
shown
using
a
radioligand
binding
assay
.

High

with
pharmacological
specificity
was
demonstrated
for

Transfection

The

(
mifepristone
)
significantly
counteracted
the
effect
of
dexamethasone
on
glucocorticoid

,
indicating
that
the
dexamethasone
effect
is
specific
and
is
mediated
through
the

In
summary
,
our
study
demonstrated
that
primary
cultures
of
human
bronchial
epithelial
cells
possess
glucocorticoid
receptors
that
function
as
a
ligand

The
presence

glucocorticoid

confers
their

Molecular
characterization
of
the
surface
of
apoptotic
neutrophils
:
implications
for
functional
downregulation
and
recognition
by
phagocytes
.

We
have
used
a
panel
of
monoclonal
antibodies
and
lectins
to
examine
the
profile
of
surface
molecule
expression
on
human
neutrophils
that
have
undergone
spontaneous
apoptosis
during
in
vitro
culture
.

Neutrophil
apoptosis
was
found
to
be
accompanied
by
down
-
regulation
of
the
immunoglobulin
superfamily
members
PECAM
-
1
(
CD31
)
,
ICAM
-
3
(
CD50
)
,
CD66acde
,
and
CD66b
and
the
integrin
-
associated
proteins
CD63
and
urokinase
plasminogen
activator
receptor
(
CD87
)
that
may
alter
the
potential
for
adhesive
interactions
.

Cellular
interactions
may
be
further
influenced
by
the
reduction
of
the
expression
of
surface
carbohydrate
moieties
,
including
sialic
acid
.

Reduced
expression
of
FcgammaRII
(
CD32
)
,
complement
receptor
type
1
(
CD35
)
and
receptors
for
pro
-
inflammatory
mediators
C5a
(
CD88
)
and
TNFalpha
(
CD120b
)
associated
with
apoptosis
might
limit
neutrophil
responsiveness
to
stimuli
that
trigger
degranulation
responses
.

Although
many
of
the
receptors
we
have
examined
are
expressed
at
reduced
levels
on
apoptotic
neutrophils
,
we
found
that
there
was
differential
loss
of
certain
receptors
(
e
.
g
.
CD16
,
CD15
and
CD120b
)
and
increased
expression
of
aminopeptidase
-
N
(
CD13
)
.

Together
with
our
previous
data
showing
that
expression
of
certain
molecules
e
.
g
.
LFA
-
3
(
CD58
)
is
not
altered
during
neutrophil
apoptosis
,
these
data
are
suggestive
of
specific
changes
in
receptor
mobilisation
and
shedding
associated
with
apoptosis
.

Although
reduced
expression
of
CD63
(
azurophilic
granules
)
and
CR1
(
specific
granules
)
indicates
that
granule
mobilisation
does
not
accompany
apoptosis
,
a
monoclonal
antibody
(
BOB78
)
,
that
recognises
a
90
kDa
antigen
localised
in
intracellular
granules
,
defines
a
subpopulation
of
apoptotic
neutrophils
that
exhibit
nuclear
degradation
yet
retain
intact
plasma
membranes
.

BOB78
positive
neutrophils
were
found
to
bind
biotinylated
thrombospondin
,
suggesting
that
this
mAb
defines
surface
molecular
changes
associated
with
exposure
of
thrombospondin

moieties
.

A
positron
emission
tomography
study
of
quetiapine
in
schizophrenia
:
a
preliminary
finding
of
an
antipsychotic
effect
with
only
transiently
high
dopamine
D2
receptor
occupancy
.

BACKGROUND
:
Quetiapine
is
a
new
atypical
antipsychotic
medication
.

As
such
,
relatively
little
has
been
published
regarding
its
in
vivo
effects
at
the
dopamine
type
2
(
D2
)
and
serotonin
type
2a
(
5
-
HT2a
)
receptor
systems
.

The
following
study
was
undertaken
to
explore
these
effects
across
the
clinical
dose
range
and
relate
this
information
to
its
clinical
profile
.

METHODS
:
Twelve
patients
with
schizophrenia
were
randomly
assigned
to
doses
of
150
to
600
mg
/
d
(
n
=
3
,
at
150
,
300
,
450
,
and
600
mg
/
d
)
of
quetiapine
.

After
3
weeks
of
treatment
,
D2
and
5
-
HT2a
occupancy
were
measured
using
positron
emission
tomography
(
PET
)
imaging
,
12
to
14
hours
after
the
last
dose
.

Clinical
efficacy
and
adverse
effect
ratings
were
obtained
at
baseline
,
at
the
time
of
PET
scanning
,
and
at
12
weeks
.

Two
additional
patients
were
included
to
examine
the
effects
of
the
drug
2
to
3
hours
after
last
dose
.

RESULTS
:
Quetiapine
was
an
effective
antipsychotic
and
improved
the
extrapyramidal
symptoms
and
prolactin
level
elevation
noted
at
baseline
.

It
achieved
these
results
with
minimal
(
0
%
-
27
%
)
D2
occupancy
12
hours
after
the
last
dose
.

Study
of
the
additional
subjects
revealed
that
quetiapine
does
give
rise
to
transiently
high
(
58
%
-
64
%
)
D2
occupancy
2
to
3
hours
after
a
single
dose
that
then
decreases
to
minimal
levels
in
12
hours
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
Quetiapine
shows
a
transiently
high
D2
occupancy
,
which
decreases
to
very
low
levels
by
the
end
of
the
dosing
interval
.

Quetiapine
'
s
low
D2
occupancy
can
explain
its
freedom
from
extrapyramidal
symptoms
and
prolactin
level
elevation
.

The
data
suggest
that
transient
D2
occupancy
may
be
sufficient
for
its
antipsychotic
effect
.

Future
studies
controlling
for
nonpharmacological
effects
as
well
as
activities
on
other
receptors
will
be
necessary
to
confirm
this
suggestion
.

Correlations
of
receptor
binding
and
metabolic
and
mitogenic
potencies
of
insulin
analogs
designed
for
clinical
use
.

In
recent
years
,
analogs
of
human
insulin
have
been
engineered
with
the
aim
of
improving
therapy
for
people
with
diabetes
.

To
ensure
that
the
safety
profile
of
the
human
hormone
is
not
compromised
by
the
molecular
modifications
,
the
toxico
-
pharmacological
properties
of
insulin
analogs
should
be
carefully
monitored
.

In
this
study
,
we
compared
the
insulin
and
IGF
-
I
receptor
binding
properties
and
metabolic
and
mitogenic
potencies
of
insulin
aspart
(
B28Asp
human
insulin
)
,
insulin
lispro
(
B28Lys
,
B29Pro
human
insulin
)
,
insulin
glargine
(
A21Gly
,
B31Arg
,
B32Arg
human
insulin
)
,
insulin
detemir
(
NN304
)
[
B29Lys
(
epsilon
-
tetradecanoyl
)
,
desB30
human
insulin
]
,
and
reference
insulin
analogs
.

Receptor
affinities
were
measured
using
purified
human
receptors
,
insulin
receptor
dissociation
rates
were
determined
using
Chinese
hamster
ovary
cells
overexpressing
the
human
insulin
receptor
,
metabolic
potencies
were
evaluated
using
primary
mouse
adipocytes
,
and
mitogenic
potencies
were
determined
in
human
osteosarcoma
cells
.

Metabolic
potencies
correlated
well
with
insulin
receptor
affinities
.

Mitogenic
potencies
in
general
correlated
better
with
IGF
-
I
receptor
affinities
than
with
insulin
receptor
off
-
rates
.

The
2
rapid
-
acting
insulin
analogs
aspart
and
lispro
resembled
human
insulin
on
all
parameters
,
except
for
a
slightly
elevated
IGF
-
I
receptor
affinity
of
lispro
.

In
contrast
,
the
2
long
-
acting
insulin
analogs
,
glargine
and
detemir
,
differed
significantly
from
human
insulin
.

The
combination
of
the
B31B32diArg
and
A21Gly
substitutions
provided
insulin
glargine
with
a
6
-
to
8
-
fold
increased
IGF
-
I
receptor
affinity
and
mitogenic
potency
compared
with
human
insulin
.

The
attachment
of
a
fatty
acid
chain
to
LysB29
provided
insulin
detemir
with
reduced
receptor
affinities
and
metabolic
and
mitogenic
potencies
but
did
not
change
the
balance
between
mitogenic
and
metabolic
potencies
.

The
safety
implications
of
the
increased
growth
-
stimulating
potential
of
insulin
glargine
are
unclear
.

The
reduced
in
vitro
potency
of
insulin
detemir
might
explain
why
this
analog
is
not
as
effective
on
a
molar
basis
as
human
insulin
in
humans
.

in

gradient
and
mild
inward
rectification
in
symmetrical
K
(

conditions
.

TWIK
-
2
currents
are
inactivating
at
depolarized
potentials
,
and
the
kinetic
of
inactivation
is
highly
temperature

sensitive
.

TWIK
-
2
shows
an
extremely
low
conductance
,
which
prevents
the
visualization
of
discrete
single

.

The
inactivation
and
rectification
are
intrinsic
properties
of
TWIK
-
2
channels
.

In
a

,
TWIK

is

,
and

.

Finally
,
cysteine

in
the
M1P1
external
loop
is
required
for
functional
expression
of
TWIK
-
2
but
is
not
critical
for
subunit

assembly
.

TWIK
-
2
is
the
first
reported
2P

K
(

)
channel
that
inactivates
.

The
base

line
,
transient
,
and
delayed
activities
of
TWIK
-
2
suggest
that
this
novel
2P
domain
K
(

channel
may
play
an
important
functional
role
in
cell
electrogenesis
.

acid
-
supplemented
diets
prevents
serum
arachidonic
acid
accumulation
in
humans
.

Previous
studies
reveal
that
supplementation
of
human
diets
with
gamma
-
linolenic
acid
(
GLA
)
reduces
the
generation
of
lipid
mediators
of
inflammation
and
attenuates
clinical
symptoms
of
chronic
inflammatory
disorders
such
as
rheumatoid
arthritis
.

However
,
we
have
shown
that
supplementation
with
this
same
fatty
acid
also
causes
a
marked
increase
in
serum
arachidonate
(
AA
)
levels
,
a
potentially
harmful
side
effect
.

The
objective
of
this
study
was
to
design
a
supplementation
strategy
that
maintained
the
capacity
of
GLA
to
reduce
lipid
mediators
without
causing
elevations
in
serum
AA
levels
.

Initial
in
vitro
studies
utilizing
HEP
-
G2
liver
cells
revealed
that
addition
of
eicosapentaenoic
acid
(
EPA
)
blocked
Delta
-
5
-
desaturase
activity
,
the
terminal
enzymatic
step
in
AA
synthesis
.

To
test
the
in
vivo
effects
of
a
GLA
and
EPA
combination
in
humans
,
adult
volunteers
consuming
controlled
diets
supplemented
these
diets
with
3
.
0
g
/
d
of
GLA
and
EPA
.

This
supplementation
strategy
significantly
increased
serum
levels
of
EPA
,
but
did
not
increase
AA
levels
.

EPA
and
the
elongation
product
of
GLA
,
dihomo
-
gamma
-
linolenic
acid
(
DGLA
)
levels
in
neutrophil
glycerolipids
increased
significantly
during
the
3
-
wk
supplementation
period
.

Neutrophils
isolated
from
volunteers
fed
diets
supplemented
with
GLA
and
EPA
released
similar
quantities
of
AA
,
but
synthesized
significantly
lower
quantities
of
leukotrienes
compared
with
their
neutrophils
before
supplementation
.

This
study
revealed
that
a
GLA
and
EPA
supplement
combination
may
be
utilized
to
reduce
the
synthesis
of
proinflammatory
AA
metabolites
,
and
importantly
,
not
induce
potentially
harmful
increases
in
serum
AA
levels
.

Effects

BACKGROUND
:
This
study
examines
the
effects
of
nicorandil
,
a
K
(
+
)
channel
opener
,
on
transmural
dispersion
of
repolarization
(
TDR
)
and
induction
of
torsade
de
pointes
(
TdP
)
under
conditions
mimicking
the
LQT1
,
LQT2
,
and
LQT3
forms
of
the
congenital
long
-
QT
syndrome
(
LQTS
)
.

METHODS
AND
RESULTS
:
Transmembrane
action
potentials
of
epicardial
,
M
,
and
endocardial
cells
were
recorded
simultaneously
from
an
arterially
perfused
wedge
of
canine
left
ventricle
together
with
a
transmural
ECG
.

Chromanol
293B
(
30
micromol
/
L
)
was
used
to
block
I
(
Ks
)
(
LQT1
model
)
.

Isoproterenol
(
50
to
100
nmol
/
L
)
was
used
to
mimic
an
increase
in
beta
-
adrenergic
tone
,
d
-
sotalol
(
100
micromol
/
L
)
to
block
I
(
Kr
)
(
LQT2
model
)
,
and
ATX
-
II
(
20
nmol
/
L
)
to
augment
late
I
(
Na
)
(
LQT3
model
)
.

Isoproterenol
+
chromanol
293B
,
d
-
sotalol
,
and
ATX
-
II
produced
preferential
prolongation
of
the
action
potential
duration
at
90
%
repolarization
(
APD
(
90
)
)
of
the
M
cell
,
an
increase
of
TDR
,
and
spontaneous
as
well
as
stimulation
-
induced
TdP
(
LQT1
,
3
/
6
;
LQT2
,
3
/
6
;
LQT3
,
5
/
6
)
.

Nicorandil
(
2
to
20
micromol
/
L
)
abbreviated
the
QT
interval
and
APD
(
90
)
of
the
3
cell
types
in
the
3
models
.

High
concentrations
(
10
to
20
micromol
/
L
)
completely
reversed
the
effects
of
293B
+
/
-
isoproterenol
and
those
of
d
-
sotalol
to
increase
APD
(
90
)
and
TDR
and
to
induce
TdP
in
LQT1
and
LQT2
models
.

Nicorandil
20
micromol
/
L
reversed
only
50
%
of
the
effect
of
ATX
-
II
and
failed
to
completely
suppress
TdP
in
the
LQT3
model
(
5
/
6
to
3
/
6
)
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
Our
data
suggest
that
K
(
+
)
channel
openers
may
be
capable
of
abbreviating
the
long
QT
interval
,
reducing
TDR
,
and
preventing
spontaneous
and
stimulation
-
induced
TdP
when
congenital
or
acquired
LQTS
is
secondary
to
reduced
I
(
Kr
)
or
I
(
Ks
)
but
less
so
when
it
is
due
to
augmented
late
I
(
Na
)
.

Peroxisome
proliferator
-
activated
receptor
alpha
(
PPARalpha
)
activators
,
bezafibrate
and
Wy
-
14
,
643
,
increase
uncoupling
protein
-
3
mRNA
levels
without
modifying
the
mitochondrial
membrane
potential
in
primary
culture
of
rat
preadipocytes
.

Uncoupling
proteins
(
UCPs
)
are
inner
mitochondrial
membrane
transporters
which
act
as
pores
for
H
(
+
)
ions
,
dissipating
the
electrochemical
gradient
that
develops
during
mitochondrial
respiration
at
the
expense
of
ATP
synthesis
.

We
have
studied
the
effects
of
two
fibrates
,
bezafibrate
and
Wy
-
14
,
643
,
on
UCP
-
3
and
UCP
-
2
mRNA
levels
in
primary
monolayer
cultures
of
rat
adipocytes
and
undifferentiated
preadipocytes
.

Treatment
with
both
PPARalpha
activators
for
24
h
up
-
regulated
UCP
-
3
mRNA
levels
.

Thus
,
bezafibrate
treatment
resulted
in
an
8
-
fold
induction
in
UCP
-
3
mRNA
levels
in
preadipocytes
compared
with
the
3
.
5
-
fold
induction
observed
in
adipocytes
.

Differences
in
the
induction
of
UCP
-
3
between
these
cells
correlated
well
with
the
higher
expression
of
PPARalpha
and
RXRalpha
mRNA
values
in
preadipocytes
compared
to
adipocytes
.

Wy
-
14
,
643
caused
similar
effects
on
UCP
-
3
mRNA
expression
.

In
contrast
to
UCP
-
3
,
UCP
-
2
mRNA
levels
were
only
slightly
modified
by
bezafibrate
in
adipocytes
.

The
induction
in
UCP
-
3
expression
was
not
accompanied
by
changes
in
the
mitochondrial
membrane
potential
of
rat
primary
preadipocytes
after
bezafibrate
or
Wy
-
14
,
643
treatment
.

Since
it
has
been
proposed
that
UCP
-
3
could
be
involved
in
the
regulation
of
the
use
of
fatty
acids
as
fuel
substrates
,
the
UCP
-
3
induction
achieved
after
bezafibrate
and
Wy
-
14
,
643
treatment
may
indicate
a
higher
oxidation
of
fatty
acids
,
limiting
their
availability
to
be
stored
as
triglycerides
.

This
change
may
result
in
a
reduced
rate
of
conversion
of
preadipocytes
to
adipocytes
,
which
directly
affects
fat
depots
.

Schisandrin
B
protects
against
menadione
-
induced
hepatotoxicity
by
enhancing
DT
-
diaphorase
activity
.

Pretreating
mice
with
schisandrin
B
(
Sch
B
)
,
a
dibenzocyclooctadiene
derivative
isolated
from
the
fruit
of
Schisandra
chinensis
,
at
a
daily
dose
of
1
mmol
/
kg
for
3
days
protected
against
menadione
-
induced
hepatic
oxidative
damage
in
mice
,
as
evidenced
by
decreases
in
plasma
alanine
aminotransferase
activity
(
78
%
)
and
hepatic
malondialdehyde
level
(
70
%
)
,
when
compared
with
the
menadione
intoxicated
control
.

In
order
to
define
the
biochemical
mechanism
involved
in
the
hepatoprotection
afforded
by
Sch
B
pretreatment
,
we
examined
the
activity
of
DT
-
diaphorase
(
DTD
)
in
hepatocytes
isolated
from
Sch
B
pretreated
rats
.

Hepatocytes
isolated
from
Sch
B
pretreated
(
a
daily
dose
of
1
mmol
/
kg
for
3
days
)
rats
showed
a
significant
increase
(
25
%
)
in
DTD
activity
.

The
increase
in
DTD
activity
was
associated
with
the
enhanced
rate
of
menadione
elimination
in
the
hepatocyte
culture
.

The
ensemble
of
results
suggests
that
the
ability
of
Sch
B
pretreatment
to
enhance
hepatocellular
DTD
activity
may
at
least
in
part
be
attributed
to
the
protection
against
menadione
hepatotoxicity
.

Interactive
and
delayed
effects
of
pyridostigmine
and
physical
stress
on
biochemical
and
histological
changes
in
peripheral
tissues
of
mice
.

Gulf
War
veterans
were
taking
pyridostigmine
orally
against
possible
exposure
to
nerve
agents
as
well
as
being
under
physical
stress
.

This
study
was
designed
to
investigate
the
delayed
effects
of
pyridostigmine
and
treadmill
exercise
on
cholinesterase
activity
,
lipid
peroxidation
and
histology
of
peripheral
tissues
of
mice
.

Male
NIH
Swiss
mice
were
divided
into
four
groups
of
15
animals
each
and
treated
as
follows
:
sedentary
control
;
exercise
training
for
10
weeks
;
pyridostigmine
(
1
.
2
mg
kg
(
-
1
)
,
p
.
o
.
)
for
2
weeks
during
weeks
5
and
6
;
and
pyridostigmine
plus
exercise
training
.

The
mice
were
sacrificed
24
h
after
the
last
exercise
,
and
blood
,
triceps
muscle
and
sciatic
nerve
were
isolated
and
analyzed
.

The
group
treated
with
pyridostigmine
alone
showed
decreased
plasma
butyrylcholinesterase
(
BChE
)
activity
(
87
%
of
control
)
,
whereas
pyridostigmine
plus
exercise
significantly
decreased
the
BChE
activity
(
79
%
of
control
)
,
indicating
an
interactive
effect
of
the
combination
.

Acetylcholinesterase
(
AChE
)
activity
did
not
alter
significantly
in
red
blood
cells
,
platelets
or
sciatic
nerve
with
either
of
the
treatments
.

However
,
AChE
activity
in
triceps
muscle
decreased
significantly
(
78
%
of
control
)
in
the
group
treated
with
pyridostigmine
plus
exercise
.

Creatine
phosphokinase
activity
in
plasma
increased
slightly
(
compared
to
control
,
pyridostigmine
or
exercise
group
)
in
mice
treated
with
pyridostigmine
plus
exercise
,
which
may
be
indicative
of
perturbation
in
the
integrity
of
the
skeletal
muscle
due
to
combination
.

However
,
there
were
no
obvious
histological
abnormalities
in
the
triceps
muscle
detected
between
experimental
and
control
groups
.

Interaction
of
pyridostigmine
and
exercise
significantly
increased
the
concentration
of
the
end
product
of
lipid
peroxidation
(
malondialdehyde
)
(
124
%
of
control
)
in
triceps
muscle
,
indicating
an
oxidative
stress
response
of
the
combination
.

These
results
indicate
that
physical
stress
enhanced
the
delayed
toxic
effects
of
a
subchronic
oral
dose
of
pyridostigmine
primarily
in
the
skeletal
muscle
of
mice
.

Effect
of
hormonal
agents
on
monocyte
chemotactic
protein
-

expression
by
endometrial
epithelial
cells
of
women
with
endometriosis
.

OBJECTIVE
:
To
assess
whether
hormonal
agents
used
in
the
medical
treatment
of
endometriosis
,
such
as
danazol
and
GnRH
agonist
,
exert
direct
regulatory
action
on
monocyte
chemotactic
protein

(
MCP
-

)
expression
by
endometrial
epithelial
cells
.

DESIGN
:
Primary
cultures
of
epithelial
cells
isolated
from
human
endometrium
were
exposed
to
different
concentrations
of
cytokines
and
steroid
hormone
analogs
.

Expression
of
MCP
-

was
analyzed
at
the
levels
of
protein
and
messenger
RNA
.

SETTING
:
Gynecology

and
laboratory
of
endocrinology
of

.

PATIENT
(
S
)
:
Women
presenting
for
infertility
or
pelvic

in
whom
endometriosis
was
diagnosed
by
using
laparoscopy
.

INTERVENTION

performed
at
laparoscopy
.

MAIN

:
Secretion
of
MCP

1
protein
was
measured
by
using
enzyme

linked
immunosorbent
assay
,
and
mRNA
steady

were
measured
by
performing
Northern

)
,
showed
a
direct
and
a
dose
-
dependent
inhibitory
effect
on
MCP
-

expression
.

This
effect
occurred
at
the
level
of
protein
and
mRNA
.

CONCLUSION
(
S
)
:
The
findings
of
the
study
may
affect
understanding
of
the
mechanisms
by
which
hormonal
treatments
act
on
endometriosis
and
influence
its
clinical
manifestations
.

Pharmacological
modulation
of
nerve
growth
factor
synthesis
:
a
mechanistic
comparison
of
vitamin
D
receptor
and
beta
(
2
)
-
adrenoceptor
agonists
.

Increasing
nerve
growth
factor
(
NGF
)
in
the
PNS
is
a
rational
strategy
for
treating
certain
neurodegenerative
disorders
.

The
present
studies
were
undertaken
to
compare
two
compounds
,
a
vitamin
D
(
3
)
analogue
(
CB1093
)
with
minimal
calcaemic
effects
,
and
clenbuterol
,
a
long
-
acting
beta
(
2
)
-
adrenoceptor
agonist
,
both
of
which
induce
NGF
synthesis
in
vivo
.

Clenbuterol
caused
significant
increases
in
both
NGF
mRNA
and
protein
in
3T3
cells
;
with
maxima
at
10
nM
and
at
8
-
12
h
exposure
.

Effects
of
clenbuterol
on
NGF
mRNA
were
antagonized
by
propranolol
.

Mobility
shift
assays
on
whole
cell
extracts
showed
that
clenbuterol
increased
AP1
binding
in
3T3
cells
prior
to
increasing
NGF
synthesis
.

Clenbuterol
was
without
effect
on
NGF
mRNA
levels
in
L929
cells
,
whereas
CB1093
caused
significant
increases
in
both
NGF
mRNA
and
protein
levels
in
both
3T3
and
L929
cells
.

Stimulation
was
almost
maximal
at
24
h
exposure
and
was
sustained
for
at
least
72
h
.

The
magnitude
of
the
increase
was
much
greater
in
L929
(
700
%
increase
)
than
in
3T3
cells
(
80
%
)
.

Binding
to
the
vitamin
D
nuclear
receptor
(
VDR
)
,
which
acts
as
a
transcription
factor
itself
,
was
increased
as
early
as
30
min
after
exposure
to
of
CB1093
and
maintained
up
to
24
h
.

Increased
VDR
binding
preceded
increased
NGF
mRNA
.

A
150
%
increase
in
AP
-
1
binding
was
also
evident
.

This
study
demonstrates
that
CB1093
and
clenbuterol
stimulate
NGF
levels
in
vitro
and
that
AP
-
1
binding
could
be
a
commonality
between
the
mechanism
of
NGF
induction
of
these
two
compounds
.

Protective
effect
of
halothane
anesthesia
on
retinal
light
damage
:
inhibition
of
metabolic
rhodopsin
regeneration
.

PURPOSE
:
To
determine
whether
the
volatile
anesthetic
halothane
protects
against
light
-
induced
photoreceptor
degeneration
in
the
rodent
retina
.

METHODS
:
Albino
mice
and
rats
were
anesthetized
with
halothane
and
exposed
to
high
levels
of
white
or
blue
light
.

Nonanesthetized
animals
served
as
controls
.

Retinal
morphology
was
assessed
by
light
microscopy
,
and
apoptosis
of
photoreceptor
cells
was
verified
by
detection
of
fragmented
genomic
DNA
and
in
situ
staining
of
apoptotic
nuclei
(
TUNEL
assay
)
.

Rhodopsin
regeneration
after
bleaching
was
determined
by
measuring
rhodopsin
levels
in
retinas
of
mice
or
rats
at
different
time
points
in
darkness
.

RESULTS
:
Halothane
anesthesia
reversibly
inhibited
metabolic
rhodopsin
regeneration
and
thus
prevented
rhodopsin
from
absorbing
high
numbers
of
photons
during
light
exposure
.

Consequently
,
photoreceptors
of
mice
and
rats
anesthetized
with
halothane
were
completely
protected
against
degeneration
induced
by
white
light
.

In
remarkable
contrast
,
however
,
halothane
anesthesia
did
not
protect
against
blue
-
light
-
induced
photoreceptor
cell
death
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
After
the
initial
bleach
,
halothane
impeded
photon
absorption
by
rhodopsin
by
inhibiting
metabolic
rhodopsin
regeneration
.

Apparently
,
the
rhodopsin
-
mediated
uptake
of
the
critical
number
of
photons
to

was
prevented
.

In
contrast
,
halothane
did
not
protect
the
retina
against
blue

.

Blue
light
can
efficiently
restore
functional
rhodopsin
from
bleaching
intermediates
through
a
process
termed
photoreversal
of
bleaching
.

This
process
does
not
depend
on
the
visual
cycle
via
the
pigment
epithelium
but
nevertheless
enables
rhodopsin
molecules
to
absorb
the
critical
number
of
photons
required
to
induce
retinal
degeneration
.

in
the
forced
swimming
test
:
involvement
of
5
-
HT1A
and

receptors
in
old
mice
.

RATIONALE
:
A
recent
study
suggested
that
selective
serotonin
reuptake
inhibitors
were
inactive
in
40
-
week
-
old
male
mice
in
the
mouse
forced
swimming
test
,
possibly
because
of
alteration
of
5
-
HT1
receptors
.

OBJECTIVES
:
The
present
study
was
aimed
at
investigating
the
action
of
various
antidepressant
drugs
in
4
-
and
40
-
week
-
old
male
mice
using
the
mouse
forced
swimming
test
and
determining
the
involvement
of
5
-
HT1A
and
5
-
HT1B
receptors
mediating
the
effects
.

METHODS
:
Different
classes
of
antidepressants
[
imipramine
(
tricyclic
)
,
maprotiline
(
noradrenline
reuptake
inhibitor
)
,
venlafaxine
(
mixed
serotonin
and
noradrenaline
reuptake
inhibitors
)
,
fluvoxamine
and
sertraline
(
selective
serotonin
reuptake
inhibitor
)
]
were
tested
in
the
same
randomised
experimental
session
,
alone
and
in
combination
with
5
-
HT1A
and
5
-
HT1B
receptor
agonists
[
buspirone
(
partial
5
-
HT1A
agonist
)
,
anpirtoline
(
5
-
HT1B
agonist
)
]
in
the
mouse
forced
swimming
test
.

RESULTS
:
All
antidepressants
were
found
to
be
active
in
the
mouse
forced
swimming
test
in
4
-
week
-
old
mice
and
40
-
week
-
old
mice
,
with
the
exception
of
fluvoxamine
in
the
40
-
week
-
old
mice
.

The
anti
-
immobility
effect
after
antidepressant
administration
was
higher
in
4
-
week
-
old
male
mice
than
in
40
-
week
-
old
male
mice
.

Venlafaxine
is
the
most
active
antidepressant
drug
in
40
-
week
-
old
mice
.

Prior
administration
of
buspirone
(
0
.
06
mg
/
kg
,
i
.
p
.
)
or
anpirtoline
(
1
mg
/
kg
,
i
.
p
.
)
enhanced
the
antidepressant
-
like
effects
in
4
-
week
-
old
mice
(
except
in
the
case
of
sertraline
,
8
mg
/
kg
)
.

In
elderly
mice
,
only
prior
administration
of
buspirone
enhanced
the
antidepressant
-
like
effects
of
fluvoxamine
.

A
neurochemical
study
showed
that
significantly
higher
serotonin
and
dopamine
concentrations
were
found
in
40
-
week
-
old
control
mice
brains
than
4
-
week
-
old
control
mice
brains
but
that
the
noradrenaline
concentration
is
higher
in
4
-
week
-
old
mice
.

CONCLUSION
:
Tricyclic
,
noradrenaline
reuptake
inhibitors
and
serotonin
reuptake
inhibitors
are
more
active
in
4
-
week
-
old
mice
than
40
-
week
-
old
mice
.

Our
results
suggested
that
5
-
HT1B
receptors
may
be
more
altered
than
5
-
HT1A
receptors
in
40
-
week
-
old
mice

A
oxidative
activity
in
koala
(
Phascolarctos

)
and
tammar

(

)
and
compared
our
results
to
those
determined
in
rat
.

Microsomal
lauric
acid

was
significantly
higher
in
koala
than
in
tammar
wallaby
or
rat
.

However
,
cyanide
-
insensitive
palmitoyl

CoA
oxidation
was
absent
in
the
koala
.

We
have
also
determined
the
hepatic
nicotinamide
cofactors
in
these
species
.

Hepatic
nicotinamide
-
adenine
dinucleotide
(
NAD
)
and
the
ratio
of
NAD
/
nicotinamide
-
adenine
dinucleotide
phosphate
(
NADP
)
were
higher
in
koala
than
in
tammar
wallaby
and
rat
liver
.

Reverse

of
koala

mRNA
,
followed
by
polymerase
chain
reaction
using
primers
based
on
highly

areas
in
the
CYP4A
family
led
to
the
cloning
of
a

clone
with
approximately
70
%
nucleotide
and
deduced
amino

Gemcitabine
and
Pemetrexed
disodium
in
treating
breast
cancer
.

Pemetrexed
disodium
(
Alimta
,
LY231514
)
is
a
novel
,
multitargeted
antifolate
that
inhibits
thymidylate
synthase
,
dihydrofolate
reductase
,
and
glycinamide
ribonucleotide
formyl
transferase
.

This
agent
is
broadly
active
in
a
wide
variety
of
solid
tumors
,
including
breast
cancer
.

Pemetrexed
disodium
has
also
shown
clinically
relevant
activity
in
combination
with
gemcitabine
(
Gemzar
)
.

This
combination
is
being
evaluated
for
the
treatment
of
metastatic
breast
cancer
.

Distal
bowel
selectivity
in
the
chemoprevention
of
experimental
colon
carcinogenesis
by
the
non
-
steroidal
anti
-
inflammatory
drug
nabumetone
.

Use
of
non
-
steroidal
anti
-
inflammatory
drugs
(
NSAIDs
)
for
chemoprevention
of
colon
cancer
has
been
hindered
by
their
potential
gastro
-
intestinal
toxicity
.

Nabumetone
,
which
is
approximately
10
to
36
times
safer
than
conventional
NSAIDs
,
was
evaluated
in
2
models
of
experimental
colon
carcinogenesis
.

In
azoxymethane
(
AOM
)
-
treated
Fisher
344
rats
,
nabumetone
caused
dose
-
dependent
inhibition
of
aberrant
crypt
foci
(
ACF
)
,
with
750
and
1
,
500
ppm
resulting
in
15
%
and
37
%
reductions
,
respectively
(
p
<
0
.
05
)
.

Moreover
,
complex
ACF
were
reduced
by
48
%
in
the
latter
group
.

MIN
mice
studies
confirmed
the
chemopreventive
efficacy
of
nabumetone
,
with
900
ppm
suppressing
approximately
half
of
the
intestinal
tumors
.

Interestingly
,
inhibition
of
intermediate
biomarkers
in
both
models
was
markedly
greater
in
the
distal
than
the
proximal
bowel
.

To
mechanistically
evaluate
this
regional
selectivity
,
we
assessed
cyclo
-
oxygenase
-
2
(
COX
-
2
)
expression
in
the
uninvolved
mucosa
and
demonstrated
a
3
-
to
4
-
fold
excess
in
the
distal
relative
to
the
proximal
bowel
in
both
MIN
mice
and
AOM
-
treated
rats
.

We
then
investigated
another
putative
NSAID
target
,
peroxisome
proliferator
-
activated
receptor
-
delta
(
PPAR
-
delta
)
and
demonstrated
up
-
regulation
during
AOM
-
induced
colonic
tumorigenesis
.

Furthermore
,
in
pre
-
neoplastic
mucosa
,
there
was
a
3
-
fold
excess
of
PPAR
-
delta
in
the
distal
colon
.

We
demonstrate
that
nabumetone
is
an
effective
protective
agent
in
both
experimental
models
of
colon
carcinogenesis
.

The
striking
distal
predilection
of
nabumetone
may
be
,
at
least
partially
,
explained
by
distal
bowel
over
-
expression
of
COX
-
2
and
PPAR
-
delta
.

Nuclear
diacylglycerol
kinase
-
theta
is
activated
in
response
to
alpha
-
thrombin
.

Currently
,
there
is
substantial
evidence
that
nuclear
lipid
metabolism
plays
a
critical
role
in
a
number
of
signal
transduction
cascades
.

Previous
work
from
our
laboratory
showed
that
stimulation
of
quiescent
fibroblasts
with
alpha
-
thrombin
leads
to
the
production
of
two
lipid
second
messengers
in
the
nucleus
:
an
increase
in
nuclear
diacylglycerol
mass
and
an
activation
of
phospholipase
D
,
which
catalyzes
the
hydrolysis
of
phosphatidylcholine
to
generate
phosphatidic
acid
.

Diacylglycerol
kinase
(
DGK
)
catalyzes
the
conversion
of
diacylglycerol
to
phosphatidic
acid
,
making
it
an
attractive
candidate
for
a
signal
transduction
component
.

There
is
substantial
evidence
that
this
activity
is
indeed
regulated
in
a
number
of
signaling
cascades

.

In
this
report
,
we
show
that
the
addition
of
alpha
-
thrombin
to
quiescent
IIC9
fibroblasts
results
in
an
increase
in
nuclear
DGK
activity

The
examination
of
nuclei
isolated
from
quiescent
IIC9
cells
indicates
that
DGK

theta
and
DGK

delta
are
both
present
.

We

of
the
previous
observations
that

.

Constitutively
active
RhoA
inhibited
the
nuclear
stimulated
activity
,
whereas
phosphatidylserine
did
not
have
an
inhibitory
effect
.

In
addition
,
a
monoclonal
anti
-
DGK
-
theta
antibody
inhibited
the
alpha
-
thrombin
-
stimulated
nuclear
activity
in

.

These
results
demonstrate
that
DGK
-
theta
is
the
isoform
responsive
to
alpha
-
thrombin
stimulation
.

Western
blot
and
immunofluorescence
microscopy
analyses
showed
that
alpha
-
thrombin
induced
the
translocation
of
DGK
-
theta
to
the
nucleus
,
implicating
that
this
translocation
is
at
least
partly
responsible
for
the
increased
nuclear
activity
.

Taken
together
,
these
data
are
the
first
to
demonstrate
an
agonist

and
is

Despite

there
have

Vasoconstrictive
drugs
increase
carbonic
anhydrase
I
in
vascular
smooth
muscle
while
vasodilating
drugs
reduce
the
activity
of
this
isozyme
by
a
direct
mechanism
of
action
.

Carbonic
anhydrase
(
CA
)
is
a
zinc
enzyme
that
catalyses
the
reversible
hydration
reaction
of
CO2
and
plays
a
major
role
in
the
acid
-
base
balance
.

We
have
previously
shown
that
certain
vasoconstrictive
therapeutic
agents
increase
CA
I
activity
whereas
vasodilating
drugs
reduce
the
activity
of
this
isozyme
by
a
direct
mechanism
of
action
.

In
this
paper
we
studied
the
effect
of
other
vasoconstrictive
and
vasodilating
agents
on
CA
I
activity
in
order
to
elucidate
the
involvement
of
vascular
smooth
muscle
CA
I
in
vasoconstrictive
and
vasodilating
processes
.

We
studied
the
in

of
noradrenaline
,
prostaglandin
F2

,
thromboxane
A2
,
leukotriene
B4

on
purified
human
red
blood
cell
CA
I
and
vascular
smooth
muscle
CA

isolated
from
rabbits
.

In
vivo
,
we
selected
six
groups
of
five
rabbits
each
,
which
were
administered
the
following
substances
in
acute
experiments
:
orciprenaline
(
group
1
)
,
desmopressin
(
group
2
)
,
verapamil
(
group
3
)
,
irbesartan
(
group
4
)
,
acetazolamide
(
group
5
)
and
placebo
(
control
group
)
.

Vascular
smooth
muscle
CA
I
activity
and
systolic
blood
pressure
were
determined
and
compared
with
those
of
the
control
group
.

In
vitro
results
showed
that
all
the
vasoconstrictive
agents
studied
increased
purified
and
human
erythrocyte
CA
I
activity
as
well
as
vascular
smooth
muscle
CA
I
,
while
vasodilating
substances
reduced
the
activity
of
isozyme
by
a
direct
mechanism
of
action
.

The
same
results
obtained
in
vivo
showed
that
activation
of
vascular
smooth
muscle
CA
I
increased
blood
pressure
while
its
inhibition
reduced
blood
pressure
.

The
results
of
this
study
suggest
that
pHi
changes
,
induced
by
activating
or
inhibiting
CA
I
in
vascular
smooth
muscle
,
might
be
responsible
for
changes
in

Neuroparalysis
and
oxime
efficacy
in
organophosphate
poisoning
:
a
study
of
butyrylcholinesterase
.

The
temporal
profile
of
butyrylcholinesterase
(
BuChE
)
and
in
vitro
pralidoxime
-
reactivated
BuChE
was
studied
in
a
cohort
of
25
organophosphate
-
poisoned
patients
to
examine
their
relationship
to
the
development
of
intermediate
syndrome
and
to
understand
reasons
for
lack
of
efficacy
of
oxime
treatment
.

The
clinical
severity
of
poisoning
(
assessed
by
the
Namba
Scale
)
correlated
significantly
with
the
severity
of
intermediate
syndrome
.

BuChE
activity
increased
significantly
over
time
and
showed
significant
relationship
to
muscle
power
.

The
temporal
profile
of
the
enzyme
was
correlated
to
the
clinical
severity
of
poisoning
.

Reactivation
potentials
of
BuChE
(
the
difference
between
oxime
-
reactivated
and
-
unreactivated
enzyme
activity
)
declined
significantly
with
time
after
organophosphate
ingestion
.

The
reactivation
potential
of
the
enzyme
at
admission
decreased
significantly
with
increasing
severity
of
poisoning
and
was
lower
in
patients
who
developed
intermediate
syndrome
.

Patients
who
received
oxime
prior
to
hospitalization
had
a
higher
rate
of
intermediate
syndrome
and
lower
levels
of
BuChE
at
admission
than
those
who
had
not
.

The
study
suggests
that
(
i
)
BuChE
reflects
the
clinical
course
of
poisoning
,
confirming
earlier
studies
;
(
ii
)
intermediate
syndrome
may
be
associated
with
a
persistent
inhibition
of
BuChE
;
and
(
iii
)
the
lack
of
oxime
efficacy
in
our
patients
maybe
due
to
their
severity
of
poisoning
and
the
timing
of
oxime
treatment
.

Potent
alpha
(
2A
)
-
adrenoceptor
-
mediated
vasoconstriction
by
brimonidine
in
porcine
ciliary
arteries
.

PURPOSE
:
An
investigation
into
whether
alpha
(
2
)
-
adrenoceptor
agonists
induce
contractions
in
the
porcine
ciliary
arteries
and
to
characterize
the
functional
receptor
subtype
mediating
these
responses
.

METHODS
:
Isolated
arteries
from
the
intraocular
part
of
the
porcine
ciliary
artery
were
suspended
in
microvascular
myographs
for
isometric
tension
recording
.

The
segments
were
contracted
with
the
alpha
(
2
)
-
adrenoceptor
agonists
brimonidine
,
apraclonidine
,
and
oxymetazoline
.

To
determine
which
subtypes
of
the
alpha
(
2
)
-
adrenoceptor
mediate
this
contraction
,
antagonists
subselective
for
the
different
alpha
(
2
)
-
adrenoceptors
were
added
to
the
vessel
bath
before
concentration
-
response
curves
for
brimonidine
were
obtained
.

The
following
alpha
(

RESULTS
:
The
alpha

induced
vasoconstriction
in
the
porcine

tested
,
and
its

Moreover
,
there
was
a

CONCLUSIONS
:
The
alpha
(

adrenoceptor
agonists
brimonidine
,
apraclonidine
,
and
oxymetazoline
are
potent
vasoconstrictors
in

In
the
present
work
,
it
was
shown
for
the
first

Gemcitabine
and
pemetrexed
disodium
combinations
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
.

Pemetrexed
disodium
(
ALIMTA
)
is
a
novel
antimetabolite
that
inhibits
at
least
three
folate
-
dependent
enzymes
,
thymidylate
synthase
,
dihydrofolate
reductase
,
and
glycinamide
ribonucleotide
formyltransferase
.

Pemetrexed
disodium
is
broadly
active
in
a
wide
variety
of
solid
tumours
,
including
non
-
small
cell
lung
,
breast
,
bladder
,
head
and
neck
and
ovarian
cancers
.

Gemcitabine
is
a
broadly
active
pyrimidine
nucleoside
antimetabolite
,
which
is
approved
for
the
treatment
of
pancreatic
and
non
-
small
cell
lung
cancers
.

Three
preclinical
studies
have
been
reported
that
show
cytotoxic
synergy
between
gemcitabine
and
pemetrexed
.

Clinical
activity
with
this
combination
has
been
observed
in
a
phase
I
study
,
with
partial
responses
in
three
of
five
patients
previously
treated
for
non
-
small
cell
lung
cancer
.

An
international
phase
II
study
of
this
combination
in
non

small
cell
lung
cancer
is
ongoing
.

Tetrahydrofolate
biosynthesis
in
plants
:
molecular
and
functional
characterization
of
dihydrofolate
synthetase
and
three
isoforms
of
folylpolyglutamate
synthetase
in
Arabidopsis
thaliana
.

Tetrahydrofolate
coenzymes
involved
in
one
-
carbon
(
C1
)
metabolism
are
polyglutamylated
.

In
organisms
that
synthesize
tetrahydrofolate
de
novo
,
dihydrofolate
synthetase
(
DHFS
)
and
folylpolyglutamate
synthetase
(
FPGS
)
catalyze
the
attachment
of
glutamate
residues
to
the
folate
molecule
.

In
this
study
we
isolated
cDNAs
coding
a
DHFS
and
three
isoforms
of
FPGS
from
Arabidopsis
thaliana
.

The
function
of
each
enzyme
was
demonstrated
by
complementation
of
yeast
mutants
deficient
in
DHFS
or
FPGS
activity
,
and
by
measuring
in
vitro
glutamate
incorporation
into
dihydrofolate
or
tetrahydrofolate
.

DHFS
is
present
exclusively
in
the
mitochondria
,
making
this
compartment
the
sole
site
of
synthesis
of
dihydrofolate
in
the
plant
cell
.

In
contrast
,
FPGS
is
present
as
distinct
isoforms
in
the
mitochondria
,
the
cytosol
,
and
the
chloroplast
.

Each
isoform
is
encoded
by
a
separate
gene
,
a
situation
that
is
unique
among
eukaryotes
.

The
compartmentation
of
FPGS
isoforms
is
in
agreement
with
the
predominance
of
gamma
-
glutamyl
-
conjugated
tetrahydrofolate
derivatives
and
the
presence
of
serine
hydroxymethyltransferase
and
C1
-
tetrahydrofolate
interconverting
enzymes
in
the
cytosol
,
the
mitochondria
,
and
the
plastids
.

Thus
,
the
combination
of
FPGS
with
these
folate
-
mediated
reactions
can
supply
each
compartment
with
the
polyglutamylated
folate
coenzymes
required
for
the
reactions
of
C1
metabolism
.

Also
,
the
multicompartmentation
of
FPGS
in
the
plant
cell
suggests
that
the
transported
forms
of
folate
are
unconjugated
.

Rabeprazole
:
an
update
of
its
use
in
acid
-
related
disorders
.

UNLABELLED
:
Rabeprazole
is
an
inhibitor
of
the
gastric
proton
pump
.

It
causes
dose
-
dependent
inhibition
of
acid
secretion
.

In
8
-
week
studies
,
among
patients
with
gastro
-
oesophageal
reflux
disease
(
GORD
)
,
rabeprazole
20
mg
/
day
or
10mg
twice
daily
was
as
effective
as
omeprazole
and
superior
to
ranitidine
in
the
healing
of
GORD
.

Symptom
relief
with
rabeprazole
was
superior
to
that
provided
by
placebo
and
ranitidine
and
similar
to
omeprazole
.

In
long
-
term
trials
rabeprazole
10
mg
/
day
was
similar
to
omeprazole
20
mg
/
day
in
a
2
-
year
study
and
superior
to
placebo
in
1
-
year
studies
,
in
both
the
maintenance
of
healing
and
prevention
of
symptoms
in
patients
with
healed
GORD
.

In
nonerosive
GORD
,
4
-
week
studies
have
shown
rabeprazole
to
be
more
effective
than
placebo
in
relieving
heartburn
and
various
other
gastrointestinal
symptoms
.

Data
among
patients
with
Barrett
'
s
oesophagus
suggest
rabeprazole
20
mg
/
day
may
be
more
effective
than
placebo
in
maintaining
healing
of
associated
oesophagitis
after
1
year
of
treatment
.

One

week
triple
Helicobacter
pylori
eradication
therapy
with
rabeprazole
plus
clarithromycin
and
amoxicillin
achieved
eradication
rates
of
>
or
=
85
%
.

Rabeprazole
is
as
effective
as
omeprazole
and
lansoprazole
when
included
as
part
of
a
triple
-
therapy
regimen
for
the
eradication
of
H
.
pylori
.

Eradication
rates
of
>
90
%
were
achieved
when
rabeprazole
20
to
40
mg
/
day
was
included
as
part
of
a
quadruple
eradication
regimen
.

As
monotherapy
for
peptic
ulcer
healing
and
symptom
relief
,
4
-
to
8
-
week
studies
have
shown
rabeprazole
10
to
40
mg
/
day
to
be
superior
to
placebo
and
ranitidine
and
have
similar
efficacy
to
omeprazole
.

Preliminary
1
-
year
data
among
16
patients
with
Zollinger
-
Ellison
syndrome
suggest
rabeprazole
60
to
120
mg
/
day
can
resolve
and
prevent
the
recurrence
of
symptoms
and
endoscopic
lesions
associated
with
this
condition
.

In
clinical
trials
of
up
to
2
years
'
duration
the
tolerability
of
rabeprazole
is
similar
to
that
of
placebo
,
ranitidine
and
omeprazole
.

Common
adverse
events
assigned
to
rabeprazole
have
been
diarrhoea
,
headache
,
rhinitis
,
nausea
,
pharyngitis
and
abdominal
pain
.

Histological
changes
and
increases
in
serum
gastrin
levels
were
unremarkable
and
typical
of
proton
pump
inhibitors
.

No
dosage
adjustment
is
necessary
in
renal
and
mild
to
moderate
hepatic
impairment
.

CONCLUSION
:
Rabeprazole
is
a
well
tolerated
proton
pump
inhibitor
.

It
has
proven
efficacy
in
healing
,
symptom
relief
and
prevention
of
relapse
of
peptic
ulcers
and
GORD
and
can
form
part
of
effective
H

.

It
is
an

Angiotensin
II
suppression
in
humans
by
the
orally
active
renin
inhibitor
Aliskiren
(
SPP100
)
:
comparison
with
enalapril
.

Renin
is
the
main
determinant
of
angiotensin
(
Ang
)
II
levels
.

It
,
therefore
,
always
appeared
desirable
to
reduce
Ang
II
levels
by
direct
inhibition
of
renin
.

So
far
,
specific
renin
inhibitors
lacked
potency
and
/
or
oral
availability
.

We
tested
the
new
orally
active
nonpeptidic
renin
inhibitor
SPP100
(
Aliskiren
,
an
octanamide
with
a
50
%
inhibitory
concentration
[
IC50
]
in
the
low
nanomolar
range
)
in
18
healthy
volunteers
on
a
constant
100
mmol
/
d
sodium
diet
using
a
double
-
blind
,
3
-
way
crossover
protocol
.

In
3
periods
of
8
days
,
separated
by
wash
-
outs
of
6
days
,
each
volunteer
received
2
dosage
levels
of
Aliskiren
(
low
before
high
;
40
and
80
or
160
and
640
mg
/
d
)
and
randomized
placebo
or
20
mg
enalapril
.

Aliskiren
was
well
tolerated
.

Not
surprisingly
,
blood
pressure
and
heart
rate
remained
unchanged
in
these
normotensive
subjects
.

There
was
a
dose
-
dependent
decrease
in
plasma
renin
activity
,
Ang
I
,
and
Ang
II
following
single
doses
of
Aliskiren
starting
with
40
mg
.

Inhibition
was
still
marked
and
significant
after
repeated
dosing
with
maximal
decreases
in
Ang
II
levels
by
89
%
and
75
%
on
Days
1
and
8
,
respectively
,
when
the
highest
dose
of
Aliskiren
was
compared
with
placebo
.

At
the
same
time
,
mean
plasma
active
renin
was
increased
16
-
and
34
-
fold
at
the
highest
dose
of
Aliskiren
.

Plasma
drug
levels
of
Aliskiren
were
dose
-
dependent
with
maximal
concentrations
reached
between
3
to
6
hours
after
administration
;
steady
state
was
reached
between
5
and
8
days
after
multiple
dosing
.

Less
than
1
%
of
dose
was
excreted
in
the
urine
.

Plasma
and
urinary
aldosterone
levels
were
decreased
after
doses
of
Aliskiren
>
or
=
80
mg
and
after
enalapril
.

Aliskiren
at
160
and
640
mg
enhanced
natriuresis
on
Day
1
by
+
45
%
and
+
62
%
,
respectively
,
compared
with
placebo
(
100
%
,
ie
,
87
+
/
-
11
mmol
/
24h
)
and
enalapril
(
+
54
%
)
;
kaliuresis
remained
unchanged
.

In
conclusion
,
the
renin
inhibitor
Aliskiren
dose
-
dependently
decreases
Ang
II
levels
in
humans
following
oral
administration
.

The
effect
is
long
-
lasting
and
,
at
a
dose
of
160
mg
,
is
equivalent
to
that
of
20
mg
enalapril
.

Aliskiren
has
the
potential
to
become
the
first
orally
active
renin
inhibitor
that
provides
a
true
alternative
to
ACE
-
inhibitors
and
Ang
II
receptor
antagonists
in
therapy
for
hypertension
and
other
cardiovascular
and
renal
diseases

Heterogeneity
of
persistent
hyperinsulinaemic
hypoglycaemia
.

A
series
of
175
cases
.

UNLABELLED
:
Hyperinsulinism
is
a
heterogeneous
disorder
characterised
by
severe
hypoglycaemia
due
to
an
inappropriate
oversecretion
of
insulin
.

In
a
personal
series
of
175
patients
investigated
for
hyperinsulinaemic
hypoglycaemia
over
the
last
20
years
,
we
review
clinical
presentations
,
molecular
studies
and
therapeutic
management
of
hyperinsulinism
.

There
were
98
neonatal
-
onset
patients
,
including
86
permanent
hyperinsulinism
and
12
transient
forms
,
68
with
infancy
-
onset
and
nine
with
childhood
-
onset
.

Hyperammonaemia
was
found
in
12
out
of
69
patients
tested
,
4
neonates
and
8
infants
.

Neonates
were
clinically
more
severely
affected
than
infants
.

Diagnosis
of
infancy
-
onset
hyperinsulinism
was
often
delayed
because
of
less
profound
hypoglycaemia
and
better
tolerance
to
hypoglycaemia
.

Neonates
required
higher
rates
of
i
.
v
.
glucose
than
infants
to
maintain
normal
plasma
glucose
levels
(
16
mg
/
kg
per
min
versus
12
mg
/
kg
per
min
)
.

Only
16
%
of
neonates
were
diazoxide
-
sensitive
compared
to
66
%
of
the
infants
.

Neonates
with
hyperammonaemia
or
transient
hyperinsulinism
were
diazoxide
-
sensitive
.

Most
neonates
were
pancreatectomised
whereas
65
%
of
the
infants
were
treated
medically
.

Among
surgically
-
treated
patients
,
47
%
had
a
focal
adenomatous
hyperplasia
(
31
neonates
and
13
infants
)
and
53
%
a
diffuse
form
of
hyperinsulinism
(
39
neonates
and
11
infants
)
.

Diazoxide
-
responsiveness
in
the
focal
and
diffuse
forms
did
not
differ
in
both
neonates
and
infants
;
it
depended
only
upon
the
age
of
onset
of
hypoglycaemia
.

One
or
two
mutations
,
SUR1
or
KIR6
.
2
,
were
found
in
41
of
73
neonates
who
were
investigated
and
in
13
/
38
infants
using
polymerase
chain
reaction
-
single
strand
conformational
polymorphism
analysis
of
both
genes
.

Almost
all
patients
with
SUR1
(
38
/
41
)
or
KIR6
.
2
(
5
/
7
)
mutations
were
resistant
to
diazoxide
.

Ten
patients
with
hyperinsulinism
-
hyperammonaemia
syndrome
had
a
mutation
in
the
glutamate
dehydrogenase
gene
(
three
neonates
and
seven
infants
)
after
reverse
transcriptase
-
polymerase
chain
reaction
and
sequence
analysis
of
cDNA
.

No
mutation
was
found
by
polymerase
chain
reaction
-
single
strand
conformational
polymorphism
in
the
glucokinase
gene
.

Eight
of
nine
patients
with
childhood
onset
hyperinsulinism
were
treated
surgically
and
histological
examination
confirmed
an
adenoma
in
each
case
.

CONCLUSION
:
the
clinical
severity
of
hyperinsulinism
varies
mainly
with
age
at
onset
of
hypoglycaemia
.

The
heterogeneity
of
hyperinsulinism
has
major
consequences
in
terms
of
therapeutic
outcome
and
genetic
counselling
.

Donepezil
hydrochloride
:
a
treatment
drug
for
Alzheimer
'
s
disease
.

The
role
of
the
cholinergic
system
with
respect
to
cognitive
deficits
characteristic
of
Alzheimer
'
s
disease
(
AD
)
has
led
to
a
number
of
studies
focusing
on
the
development
of
acetylcholinesterase
(
AChE
)
inhibitors
as
a
drug
for
treating
this
disease
.

The
earliest
known
AChE
inhibitors
,
namely
,
physostigmine
and
tacrine
,
performed
poorly
in
clinical
trials
(
e
.
g
.
,
poor
oral
activity
,
brain
penetration
,
and
hepatotoxic
liability
)
.

Studies
were
then
focused
on
finding
a
new
type
of
acetylcholinesterase
inhibitor
that
would
overcome
the
disadvantages
of
these
two
compounds
.

Donepezil
hydrochloride
inaugurates
a
new
class
of
AChE
inhibitors
with
longer
and
more
selective
action
and
with
manageable
adverse
effects

In

Thalidomide
in
multiple
myeloma
.

Thalidomide
-
-
removed
from
widespread
clinical
use
by
1962
because
of
severe
teratogenicity
-
-
has
anti
-
angiogenic
and
immunomodulatory
effects
,
including
the
inhibition
of
TNF
alpha
.

It
has
returned
to
practice
as
an
effective
oral
agent
in
the
management
of
various
disease
states
including
erythema
nodosum
leprosum
,
for
which
it
was
FDA
-
approved
in
1998
,
and
more
recently
certain
malignancies
,
including
multiple
myeloma
.

Whilst
the
mechanism
of
action
of
thalidomide
remains
incompletely
understood
,
considerable
insight
has
been
generated
by
extensive
preclinical
studies
in
multiple

.

Moreover
,
clinical
trials
both
as
a
single
agent
and
in
combination
have
confirmed
benefit
in
relapsed
and
refractory
disease
.

Thalidomide
'

role
in
treating
newly

patients
is
currently
under

it
is
now
established
as
an
important

[
Leflunomide
-
-
a
new
drug
for
pharmacological
immunomodulation
]
.

The
novel
immunomodulatory
agent
leflunomide
exhibits
a
strong
anti
-
inflammatory
action
.

This
isoxazole
derivative
is
chemically
unrelated
to
any
hitherto
applied
immunosuppressants
.

As
a
prodrug
leflunomide
is
completely
converted
to
its
active
metabolite
A
77
1726
(
M1
)
which
blocks
the
dihydroorotate
dehydrogenase
,
a
key
enzyme
of
the
pyrimidine
de

synthesis
.

Drug
-
related
adverse
effects
are
mild
,
dose
-
related
and
reversible
,
characterising
leflunomide
as
a
safe
immunosuppressant
.

While
up
to
now
leflunomide
has
just
been
approved
for
therapy
of
rheumatoid
arthritis
,
its
mechanism
of
action
affects
multiple
inflammatory
pathways
,
thereby
suggesting
it
to
be
a
potent
therapeutic
agent
in
autoimmune
diseases
,
graft
rejection
,
and
tumour
therapy
.

First
dermatological
experience
has
been
gained
in
psoriasis
and

Existing
and
emerging
endocrine
therapies
for
breast
cancer
.

Endocrine
therapy
is
first
-
line
therapy
for
patients
with
estrogen
receptor
-
positive
or
progesterone
receptor
-
positive
metastatic
breast
cancer
.

Commonly
used
endocrine
therapies
are
tamoxifen
,
megestrol
acetate
,
and
aromatase
inhibitors
.

Although
tamoxifen
and
megestrol
acetate
have
a
favorable
therapeutic
profile
,
there
are
risks
associated
with
these
agents
.

With
tamoxifen
,
the
partial
agonist
property
can
lead
to
thromboembolic
events
.

An
important
adverse
event
of
megestrol
acetate
is
weight
gain
and
fluid
retention
in
some
patients
.

The
aromatase
inhibitors
are
currently
used
as
second
-
line
therapy
after
tamoxifen
failure
.

A
recent
study
showed
that
anastrozole
,
an
aromatase
inhibitor
,
is
as
effective
or
even
superior
to
tamoxifen
when
used
as
a
first
-
line
therapy
.

However
,
not
all
patients
will
respond
to
currently
available
therapies
.

A
new
class
of
drug
,
the
estrogen
receptor
downregulators
,
has
been
developed
.

Fulvestrant
,
the
first
agent
in
this
new
class
,
not
only
induces
the
degradation
of
the
estrogen
receptor
but
also
is
an
estrogen
antagonist
;
further
,
its
lack
of
agonist
activity
provides
a
better
safety
profile
.

Two
phase
III
trials
have
proven
that
fulvestrant
is
at
least
as
effective
as
anastrozole
in
postmenopausal
women
with
advanced
breast
cancer
.

Fulvestrant
is
an
effective
and
safe
endocrine
therapy
for
postmenopausal

Microarray
and
biochemical
analysis
of
lovastatin

We
recently
identified
3
-
hydroxy
-
3
-
methylglutaryl
coenzyme
A
(
HMG
-
CoA
)
reductase
,
the
rate
-
limiting
enzyme
of
the
mevalonate
pathway
,
as
a
potential
therapeutic
target
of
the
head
and
neck
squamous
cell
carcinomas
(
HNSCC
)
and
cervical
carcinomas
(
CC
)
.

The
products
of
this
complex
biochemical
pathway
,
including
de
novo
cholesterol
,
are
vital
for
a
variety
of
key
cellular
functions
affecting
membrane
integrity
,
cell
signaling
,
protein
synthesis
,
and
cell
cycle
progression
.

Lovastatin
,
a
specific
inhibitor
of
HMG
-
CoA
reductase
,
induces
a
pronounced
apoptotic
response
in
a
specific
subset
of
tumor
types
,
including
HNSCC
and
CC
.

The
mediators
of
this
response
are
not
well
established
.

Identification
of
differentially
expressed
genes
represents
a
feasible
approach
to
delineate
these
mediators
as
lovastatin
has
the
potential
to
modulate
transcription
indirectly
by
perturbing
levels
of
sterols
and
other
mevalonate
metabolites
.

Expression
analysis
following
treatment
of
the
HNSCC
cell
lines
SCC9
or
SCC25
with
10
microM
lovastatin
for
1
day
showed
that
less
than
2
%
(
9
cDNAs
)
of
the
588
cDNAs
on
this
microarray
were
affected
in
both
cell
lines
.

These
included
diazepam
-
binding
inhibitor
/
acyl
-
CoA
-
binding
protein
,
the
activated
transcription
factor
4
and
rhoA
.

Because
the
biosynthesis
of
mevalonate
leads
to
its
incorporation
into
more
than
a
dozen
classes
of
end
products
,
their
role
in
lovastatin
-
induced
apoptosis
was
also
evaluated
.

Addition
of
the
metabolites
of
all
the
major
branches
of
the
mevalonate
pathway
indicated
that
only
the
nonsterol
moiety
,
geranylgeranyl
pyrophosphate
(
GGPP
)
,
significantly
inhibited
the
apoptotic
effects
of
lovastatin
in
HNSCC
and
CC
cells
.

Because
rhoA
requires
GGPP
for
its
function
,
this
links
the
microarray
and
biochemical
data
and
identifies
rhoA
as
a
potential
mediator
of
the
anticancer
properties
of
lovastatin
.

Our
data
suggest
that
the
depletion
of
nonsterol
mevalonate
metabolites
,
particularly
GGPP
,
can
be
potential
mediators
of
lovastatin
-
induced
apoptosis
of
HNSCC
and
CC
cells
.

Regulation
of
norepinephrine
transporter
abundance
by
catecholamines
and
desipramine
in
vivo
.

The
norepinephrine
transporter
(
NET
)
regulates
adrenoreceptor
signaling
by
controlling
the
availability
of
synaptic
norepinephrine
(
NE
)
,
and
it
is
a
direct
target
for
some
classes
of
antidepressant
drugs
.

NET
levels
are
normal
in
dopamine
beta
-
hydroxylase
knockout
(
Dbh
-
/
-
)
mice
that
lack
NE
,
demonstrating
that
the
NET
does
not
require
endogenous
NE
for
appropriate
regulation
under
physiological
conditions
.

In
contrast
,
tyrosine
hydroxylase
knockout
(
Th
-
/
-
)
mice
that
lack
both
NE
and
dopamine
(
DA
)
have
reduced
levels
of
NET
,
suggesting
that
it
is
down
-
regulated
by
a
complete
absence
of
catecholamines
and
not
NE
per
se
.

Chronic
treatment
with
the
NET
inhibitor
,
desipramine
(
DMI
)
,
reduced
NET
levels
in
both
control
and
Dbh
-
/
-
mice
,
demonstrating
that
NE
is
not
required
for
the
regulation
of
NET
by
antidepressant
drugs
.

There
are
some
qualitative
and
quantitative
differences
in
the
down
-
regulation
of
the
NET
by
catecholamine
depletion
and
DMI
treatment
,
suggesting
that
different
mechanisms
may
be
involved
.

Nicotinic
acetylcholine
receptor
regulation
of
spinal
norepinephrine
release
.

BACKGROUND
:
Neuronal
nicotinic
acetylcholine
receptor
(
nAChR
)
agonists
produce
antinociception
in
animals
.

nAChRs
exist
almost
exclusively
on
presynaptic
terminals
in
the
central
nervous
system
and
stimulate
neurotransmitter
release
.

This
study
tested
whether
nAChR
agonists
stimulate
spinal
release
of
the
neurotransmitter
norepinephrine
either
by
direct
actions
on
noradrenergic
terminals
or
indirectly
by
stimulating
release
of
other
neurotransmitters
to
induce
norepinephrine
release
.

METHODS
:
Adult
male
rats
were
anesthetized
and
microdialysis
probes
inserted
in
the
L2
-
L4
dermatomes
of
the
spinal
cord
.

Probes
were
perfused
with
artificial
cerebrospinal
fluid
containing
nicotine
,
the
specific
alpha
(
4
)
beta
(
2
*
)
nAChR
agonist
metanicotine
,
or
nicotine
plus
nAChR
antagonists
and
norepinephrine
measured
in
the
microdialysates
.

The
effects
of
specific
glutamate
receptor
antagonists
and
nitric
oxide
synthase
inhibitors
were
also
examined
.

To
determine
direct
effects
on
noradrenergic
terminals
,
synaptosomes
were
prepared
from
spinal
cord
and
incubated
with
nAChR
agonists
and
antagonists
.

RESULTS
:
Both
nicotine
and
metanicotine
induced
norepinephrine
release
in
spinal
microdialsyates
,
an
effect
reduced
by
nicotinic
antagonists
but
not
glutamate
antagonists
or
nitric
oxide
synthase
inhibitors
.

Both
of
the
nicotinic
agonists
stimulated
norepinephrine
release
in
synaptosomes
,
and
the
effect
of
metanicotine
was
blocked
at
lower
concentrations
of
alpha
(
4
)
beta
(
2
*
)
-
than
alpha
(
7
*
)
-
preferring
nAChR
antagonists
.

CONCLUSION
:
These
results
suggest
that
one
mechanism
by
which
nAChR
agonists
act
for
analgesia
is
to
stimulate
spinal
norepinephrine
release
.

They
do
so
by
actions
on
alpha
(
4
)
beta
(
2
*
)
nAChRs
,
and
perhaps
other
subtypes
,
most
likely
located
on
noradrenergic
terminals
,
rather
than
by
indirectly
stimulating
norepinephrine
release
through
glutamate
release
or
nitric
oxide
synthesis
.

,
the
isoform
of
PDE

there

resulting
in
changes
in
cAMP
levels
,
dependent
on
the
type
of

.

Cilostazol
inhibits
platelet

has
considerable
antithrombotic
effects
in
vivo
.

The
compound
relaxes
vascular
smooth
muscle
and
inhibits
mitogenesis
and
migration
of
vascular
smooth
muscle
cells
.

In
the
heart
,
cilostazol
causes
positive
inotropic
and
chronotropic
effects
.

Most
,
if
not
all
,
of
these
actions
are
cAMP
-
mediated
,
including
the
modification
of
cAMP
-
controlled
gene
expression
.

Cilostazol
decreases
levels
of
serum
triglycerides
and
causes
some
increase
in
HDL

cholesterol
levels
.

The
compound
has
a
number
of
additional
effects
which
might
contribute
to
its

clinical
efficacy
.

Cilostazol
undergoes
intensive

Identification

To
identify
amino

,
we
selected
eight
presumed

in

substrate

pocket
of

using
a
model
created
on
basis
of

We
changed
the
residues

alanine
using

technique
,
expressed
the
mutants
in
a
baculovirus

analyzed
the

of
the

enzymes
by

,
specific
inhibitors
of

The

displayed
differential

to
the

Mutants
Y751A

and
F1004A
had
reduced

In

,
the

showed
increased
K
(
i
)
for
cilostazol
but
no
difference
for
milrinone
from
the
recombinant

.

Molecular
models
show
that
the
PDE3
inhibitors
cilostazol
and
milrinone
share
some
of
common
residues
but
interact
with
distinct
residues
at
the
active
site
,
suggesting
that
selective
inhibitors
can
be
designed
with
flexible
size
against
PDE3
active
site
.

Our
study
implies
that
highly
conserved
residuals
Y751
,
D950
and
F1004
in
the
PDE
families
are
key
residues
for
binding
of
both
substrate
and
inhibitors
,
and
nonconserved
T844
may
be
responsible
for
the
cilostazol
selectivity
of
PDE3A

knowledge
of
the

Enzymatic
catalysis
in
crystals
of
Escherichia
coli
maltodextrin
phosphorylase
.

The
bacterial
enzyme
maltodextrin
phosphorylase
(
MalP
)
catalyses
the
phosphorolysis
of
an
alpha
-
1
,
4
-
glycosidic
bond
in
maltodextrins
,
removing
the
non
-
reducing
glucosyl
residues
of
linear
oligosaccharides
as
glucose
-
1
-
phosphate
(
Glc1P
)
.

In
contrast
to
the
well
-
studied
muscle
glycogen
phosphorylase
(
GP
)
,
MalP
exhibits
no
allosteric
properties
and
has
a
higher
affinity
for
linear
oligosaccharides
than
GP
.

We
have
used
MalP
as
a
model
system
to
study
catalysis
in
the
crystal
in
the
direction
of
maltodextrin
synthesis
.

The
2
.
0A
crystal
structure
of
the
MalP
/
Glc1P
binary
complex
shows
that
the
Glc1P
substrate
adopts
a
conformation
seen
previously
with
both
inactive
and
active
forms
of
mammalian
GP
,
with
the
phosphate
group
not
in
close
contact
with
the
5
'
-
phosphate
group
of
the
essential
pyridoxal
phosphate
(
PLP
)
cofactor
.

In
the
active
MalP
enzyme
,
the
residue
Arg569
stabilizes
the
negative
-
charged
Glc1P
,
whereas
in
the
inactive
form
of
GP
this
key
residue
is
held
away
from
the
catalytic
site
by
loop
280s
and
an
allosteric
transition
of
the
mammalian
enzyme
is
required
for
activation
.

The
comparison
between
MalP
structures
shows
that
His377
,
through
a
hydrogen
bond
with
the
6
-
hydroxyl
group
of
Glc1P
substrate
,
triggers
a
conformational
change
of
the
380s
loop
.

This
mobile
region
folds
over
the
catalytic
site
and
contributes
to
the
specific
recognition
of
the
oligosaccharide
and
to
the
synergism
between
substrates
in
promoting
the
formation
of
the
MalP
ternary
complex
.

The
structures
solved
after
the
diffusion
of
oligosaccharides
(
either
maltotetraose
,
G4
or
maltopentaose
,
G5
)
into
MalP
/
Glc1P
crystals
show
the
formation
of
phosphate
and
elongation
of
the
oligosaccharide
chain
.

These
structures
,
refined
at
1

8A
and
at
2

2A
,
confirm
that
only
when
an
oligosaccharide

bound
to
the

Glc1P
bend
its
phosphate
group
down
so
it
can
contact
the

'
phosphate
group
and
promote
catalysis
.

The
relatively
large
oligosaccharide
substrates
can
diffuse
quickly
into
the
MalP

Glc1P
crystals
and
the
enzymatic
reaction
can
occur
without
significant
crystal
damage
.

These
structures
obtained
before
and
after
catalysis
have
been
used
as
frames
of
a
molecular
movie
.

This
movie
reveals
the
relative
positions
of
substrates
in
the
catalytic
channel
and
shows
a
minimal
movement
of
the

The
pharmacokinetics
of
fondaparinux
sodium
in
healthy
volunteers
.

OBJECTIVE
:
Fondaparinux
sodium
is
the
first
in
a
new
class
of
synthetic
factor
Xa
inhibitors
that
binds
reversibly
with
high
affinity
to
antithrombin
III
.

It
has
been
investigated
for
the
prevention
and
treatment
of
arterial
and
venous
thrombotic
disorders
and
approved
for
use
at
a
dose
of
2
.
5mg
once
daily
in
the
prevention
of
venous
thromboembolism
in
major
orthopaedic
surgery
.

The
pharmacokinetics
of
fondaparinux
sodium
were
determined
in
eight
studies
in
young
and
elderly
healthy
volunteers
.

RESULTS
:
After
a
2
.
5mg
subcutaneous
dose
to
young
volunteers
,
absolute
bioavailability
was
100
%
and
absorption
was

.

Within

estimates
were
small
:
5

5
and
11

6
%
,
respectively
,
for

and
17
.
5
%
for

)
.

Steady
state
was
obtained
after
the
third
or
fourth
once
-
daily
dose
,
with
a
1
.
3
-
fold
increase
in
C
(
max
)
and
AUC
.

Distribution
volume
(
7
to
11L
)
was
limited
to
blood
volume
.

There
was
no
evidence
of
metabolism
.

Fondaparinux
sodium
was
almost
completely
excreted
in
urine
as
unchanged
compound
(
64
to
77
%
of
the
dose
was
recovered
at
72
hours
after
administration
)
.

Plasma
clearance
was
5
.
1
to
7
.
9
ml
/
min
,
renal
clearance
4
.
0
to
7
.
9
ml
/
min
,
and
the
terminal
half
-
life
was
17
hours
in
young
volunteers
and
21
hours
in
elderly
volunteers
.

Pharmacokinetics
of
fondaparinux
sodium
were
linear
in
the
range
2
to
8mg
subcutaneously
and
2
to
20mg
intravenously
.

Pharmacokinetics
observed
in
healthy
elderly
volunteers
were
consistent
with
findings
in
young
male
volunteers
.

CONCLUSION
:
The
favourable
pharmacokinetic
profile
of
fondaparinux
sodium
is
likely
to
play
an
important
role
in
the
major
advance
that
the
drug
represents
in
the
prevention
and
treatment
of
thrombotic
disorders
.

Molecular
analysis
of
PCCB
gene
in
Korean
patients
with
propionic
acidemia
.

Propionic
acidemia
(
PA
)
is
an
autosomal
recessive
inborn
error
in
the
catabolism
of
methionine
,
isoleucine
,
threonine
,
and
valine
,
odd
-
numbered
chain
length
fatty
acids
and
cholesterol
.

Clinical
symptoms
are
very
heterogeneous
and
present
as
a
severe
neonatal
-
onset
or
a
late
-
onset
form
.

It
is
caused
by
a
deficiency
of
propionyl
-
CoA
carboxylase
(
PCC
,
EC
6
.
4
.
1
.
3
)
,
a
biotin
-
dependent
enzyme
that
catalyzes
the
carboxylation
of
propionyl
-
CoA
to
D
-
methylmalonyl
-
CoA
.

PCC
is
a
heteropolymeric
enzyme
composed
of
alpha
-
and
beta
-
subunits
.

A
greater
heterogeneity
is
observed
in
the
PCCA
gene
,
while
for
the
PCCB
gene
,
a
limited
number
of
mutations
is
responsible
for
the
majority
of
the
alleles
characterized
in
both
Caucasian
and
Oriental
populations
.

We
identified
eight
Korean
patients
with
PA
by
organic
acid
analysis
confirmed
in
five
patients
by
the
PCC
enzyme
assay
in
the
lymphoblasts
.

Two
neonatal
-
onset
patients
showed
undetectable
PCC
activities
while
three
cases
with
residual
enzyme
activities
had
relatively
late
manifestations
.

In
the
molecular
analysis
,
we
identified
five
novel
mutations
,
Y439C
,
1527del3
,
1357insT
,
IVS12
-
8T
-
-
>
A
,
and
31del10
,
and
one
known
mutation
,
T428I
in
PCCB
gene
.

Alleleic
frequency
of
T428I
in
Korean
patients
with
PA
was
56
.
3
%
in
this
study
.

Two
neonatal
-
onset
patients
with
null
enzyme
activities
were
homozygotes
with
1527del3
and
T428I
,
respectively
.

This
finding
implies
that
T428I
and
1527del3
mutation
could
be
responsible
for
their
severe
clinical
courses
and
null
enzyme
activities
.

The
mRNA
of
PCCB
gene
in
T428I
and
1527del3
homozygotes
were
normal
but
in
Western
blot
analysis
,
the
betaPCC
-
subunit
was
only
absent
in
1527del3
homozygote
patient
suggesting
different
molecular
pathology
.

Atypical
antipsychotic
drugs
,
quetiapine
,
iloperidone
,
and
melperone
,
preferentially
increase
dopamine
and
acetylcholine
release
in
rat
medial

cortex
:
role
of
5

HT1A
receptor
agonism
.

Preferential
increases
in
both
cortical
dopamine
(
DA
)
and
acetylcholine
(
ACh
)
release
have
been
proposed
to
distinguish
the
atypical
antipsychotic
drugs
(
APDs
)
clozapine
,
olanzapine
,
risperidone
and
ziprasidone
from
typical
APDs
such
as
haloperidol
.

Although
only
clozapine
and
ziprasidone
are
directly
acting
5
-
HT
(
1A
)
agonists
,
WAY100635
,
a
selective
5
-
HT
(
1A
)
antagonist
,
partially
attenuates
these
atypical
APD
-
induced
increases
in
cortical
DA
release
that
may
be
due
to
combined
5
-
HT
(
2A
)
and
D
(
2
)
blockade
.

However
,
WAY100635
does
not
attenuate
clozapine
-
induced
cortical
ACh
release
.

The
present
study
determined
whether
quetiapine
,
iloperidone
and
melperone
,
5
-
HT
(
2A
)
/
D
(
2
)
antagonist
atypical
APDs
,
also
increase
cortical
DA
and
ACh
release
,
and
whether
these
effects
are
related
to
5
-
HT
(
1A
)
agonism
.

Quetiapine
(
30
mg
/
kg
)
,
iloperidone
(
1
-
10
mg
/
kg
)
,
and
melperone
(
3
-
10
mg
/
kg
)
increased
DA
and
ACh
release
in
the
medial
prefrontal
cortex
(
mPFC
)
.

Iloperidone
(
10
mg
/
kg
)
and
melperone
(
10
mg
/
kg
)
,
but
not
quetiapine
(
30
mg
/
kg
)
,
produced
an
equivalent
or
a
smaller
increase
in
DA
release
in
the
nucleus
accumbens
(
NAC
)
,
respectively
,
compared
to
the
mPFC
,
whereas
none
of
them
increased
ACh
release
in
the
NAC
.

WAY100635
(
0
.
2
mg
/
kg
)
,
which
alone
did
not
affect
DA
or
ACh
release
,
partially
attenuated
quetiapine
(
30
mg
/
kg
)
-
,
iloperidone
(
10
mg
/
kg
)
-
and
melperone
(
10
mg
/
kg
)
-
induced
DA
release
in
the
mPFC
.

WAY100635
also
partially
attenuated
quetiapine
(
30
mg
/
kg
)
-
induced
ACh
release
in
the
mPFC
,
but
not
that
induced
by
iloperidone
(
10
mg
/
kg
)
or
melperone
(
10
mg
/
kg
)
.

These
results
indicate
that
quetiapine
,
iloperidone
and
melperone
preferentially
increase
DA
release
in
the
mPFC
,
compared
to
the
NAC
via
a
5
-
HT
(
1A
)
-
related
mechanism
.

However
,
5
-
HT
(
1A
)
agonism
may
be
important
only
for
quetiapine

induced
ACh
release
.

Effects
of
age
and
sex
on
the
disposition
of
retigabine
.

BACKGROUND
:
The
novel
antiepileptic
drug
retigabine
is
the
first
selective
M
-
current
potassium
channel
opener
for
KCNQ2
/
3
and
KCNQ3
/
5
channels
.

Retigabine
undergoes
phase
II
metabolism
(
N
-
glucuronidation
,
acetylation
)
exclusively
and
renal
excretion
.

OBJECTIVE
:
Our
objective
was
to
evaluate
the
effects
of
age
and
sex
on
the
pharmacokinetics
of
retigabine
.

METHODS
:
Healthy
young
(
age
range
,
18
-
40
years
)
and
elderly
(
age
range
,
66
-
81
years
)
white
subjects
(
12
men
and
12
women
in
each
group
)
received
a
single
200
-
mg
oral
dose
of
retigabine
.

After
dosing
,
blood
was
collected
over
a
72
-
hour
period
to
determine
plasma
concentrations
of
retigabine
and
its
acetylated
metabolite
,
AWD21
-
360
.

Pharmacokinetics
was
compared
for
age
group
and
sex
by
ANOVA
.

RESULTS
:
In
young
men
,
retigabine
was
rapidly
absorbed
,
with
the
maximum
concentration
occurring
within
2
hours
,
and
was
eliminated
with
an
apparent
clearance
of
0
.
67
L
x
h
(
-
1
)
x
kg
(
-
1
)
and
a
mean
terminal
half
-
life
of
8
.
5
hours
.

Subjects
were
similarly
exposed
to
AWD21
-
360
.

Compared
with
young
men
,
young
women
had
higher
retigabine
maximum
concentration
(
56
%
)
and
exposure
(
20
%
)
but
similar
clearance
(
0
.
68
L
x
h
(
-
1
)
x
kg
(
-
1
)
)
;
these
differences
were
related
to
differences
in
body
weight
.

Although
maximum
concentration
was
similar
in
elderly
subjects
,
retigabine
elimination
was
slower
(
30
%
lower
apparent
clearance
normalized
for
weight
)
,
resulting
in
higher
exposure
(
42
%
)
and
a
longer
half
-
life
(
30
%
)
.

Because
phase
II
metabolism
is
scarcely
affected
by
age
,
these
differences
may
be
related
to
the
known
decline
of
renal
function
with
age
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
Although
there
are
no
substantial
sex
-
related
differences
in
the
disposition
of
retigabine
,
a
relevant
decrease
in
clearance
resulting
in
higher
exposure
occurs
in
elderly
patients
.

The
results
suggest
that
decline
of
renal
function
with
age
may
account
for
some
of
the
observed
changes
.

Selective
cyclooxygenase
-
2
inhibition
does
not
affect
the
healing
of
cutaneous
full
-
thickness
incisional
wounds
in
SKH
-
1
mice
.

BACKGROUND
:
The
inducible
cyclooxygenase
-
2
(
COX
-
2
)
enzyme
is
upregulated
in
inflammatory
diseases
,
as
well
as
in
epithelial
cancers
,
and
has
an
established
role
in
angiogenesis
and
tissue
repair
.

OBJECTIVE
:
Because
of
these
physiological
effects
and
the
widespread
use
of
the
selective
COX
-
2
inhibitor
,
celecoxib
,
we
wanted
to
determine
if
inhibition
of
COX
-
2
would
affect
incisional
skin
wound
healing
.

METHODS
:
Using
a
cutaneous
full
-
thickness
,
sutured
,
incisional
wound
model
in
hairless
SKH
-
1
mice
,
we
evaluated
the
role
of
COX
-
2
in
the
wound
healing
process
by
comparing
the
effects
of
a
nonselective
COX
inhibitor
,
diclofenac
,
with
a
selective
COX
-
2
inhibitor
,
SC
-
791
.

Healing
was
monitored
for
up
to
28
days
postincision
histologically
and
for
recovery
of
wound
strength
.

RESULTS
:
COX
-
2
expression
was
observed
over
the
first
week
of
healing
,
peaking
at
day
3
and
was
not
affected
by
treatment
with
the
selective
COX
-
2
or
nonselective
COX
inhibitors
.

Infiltrating
macrophages
,
as
well
as
keratinocytes
and
dermal
fibroblasts
at
the
wound
site
,
expressed
COX
-
2
.

Neither
selective
COX
-
2
,
nor
nonselective
COX
inhibition
had
a
significant
effect
on
the
macroscopic
or
microscopic
morphology
of
the
wounds
,
whereas
dexamethasone
treatment
resulted
in
epidermal
and
granulation
tissue
atrophy
.

In
addition
,
neither
selective
COX
-
2
,
nor
nonselective
COX
inhibition
altered
keratinocyte
proliferation
and
differentiation
,
dermal
angiogenesis
or
the
recovery
of
wound
tensile
strength
,
whereas
dexamethasone
reduced
the
tensile
strength
of
the
wounds
by
30
-
38
%
throughout
the
healing
period
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
These
data
indicate
that
selective
COX
-
2
inhibition
does
not
affect
the
healing
of
surgical
skin
wounds
.

Synthesis
and
in

evaluation
of
novel
radiotracers
for
the

)
have
been
radiolabelled
with
carbon

in
good
yield
and
at
high
specific
activity
.

These
radiotracers
are
close
analogues
of
reboxetine
,
a
potent
and
selective
ligand
for
the
norepinephrine

(
NET
)
.

They
were
examined
as
potential
ligands
for
imaging
NET
in

by
positron

(
PET
)
.

The
in

brain
distribution
of
both

were
evaluated
in

brain
uptake
and
washout
of
radioactivity
was
homogeneous
at
all

examined
(
5

60
min
)
.

In
contrast
,
administration
of
the
(

enantiomer
produced
a
heterogeneous
distribution
of
radioactivity
in
brain
with
highest
uptake
in
the
hypothalamus
,
a
NET
rich
region
,
and
lowest
uptake
in
the
striatum
,
a
brain
region
devoid
of
NET
.

Hypothalamus

ratios
of
2

were
achieved
at
60
min
post
injection
of

C
]
-
MeNER
.

Pre
-
injection
of
the
norepinephrine
reuptake
inhibitors
,
reboxetine
or
desipramine
,
reduced
hypothalamus
to
striatum
ratios
to
near
unity
while
reuptake
inhibitors
of
dopamine
and
serotonin
had
no
significant
effect
on
binding
.

In

(
rat

)
with
(
S

MeNER
produced
a

increases
the

In

ornithine
carbamoyltransferase
(

one
enzyme
complex
in
which
the
activity
of
OTCase
is
inhibited
whereas
arginase

.

The
mechanism
by
which
these
nonallosteric
enzymes
form
a
stable
complex
triggered
by
the
binding
of
their
respective
substrates
raises
the
question
of
how
such
a

association
is
induced
.

Analyses
of
mutations
in
both
enzymes
identify
residues
that
are
required
for
their
association
,
some
of
them
being
important
for
catalysis
.

In
arginase
,
two
cysteines
at

terminus
of
the

are
crucial
for
its

Study
on
the

of
cysteinyl

antagonist
,

,
on
adhesive
interaction

.

It
has
been
reported
that
cysteinyl
leukotriene
(
CysLT
)
antagonists
reduce
the
accumulation
of
eosinophils
in
the
asthmatic
airway
.

However
,
the
exact
mechanism
of
this
action
remains
to
be
established
.

In
the
present
study
,
we
examined
whether
a
CysLT
antagonist
modifies
the
adhesive
interaction
between
blood
eosinophils
and
endothelial
cells
.

Pranlukast
hydrate
,
a
CysLT
antagonist
,
blocked
the
chemotactic
response
and
adhesion
of
eosinophils
induced
by
LTD4
.

On
the
other
hand
,
pranlukast
did
not
modify
the
eosinophil
spontaneous
adhesion
to
the
resting

IL

TNF

.

Similarly
,
pranlukast
did
not
modulate
IL

-
or
FMLP
-
activated
eosinophil
adhesion
to
the
resting
endothelial

.

Finally
,
pranlukast
did
not
modify
the
expression
of
adhesion
molecules
on
endothelial
cells
stimulated
with
endothelial
activating
cytokines
.

These
results
suggest
that
the
inhibitory
action
of
CysLT
antagonist
on
eosinophil
accumulation
in
the
asthmatic
airways
involves
mechanisms
other
than
the
adhesive

Comparison

recommendations
for
their
use
in

discovery
.

The
ATP

dependent
drug
efflux
pump
P
-
glycoprotein
(
P

gp
)
affects
the
absorption
and
disposition
of
many
compounds
.

P
-
gp
may
also
play
role
in
clinically
significant
drug
-
drug
interactions
.

Therefore
,
it
is
important
to
find
potential
substrates
or
inhibitors
of
P
-
gp
early
in
the
drug
discovery
process
.

To
identify
compounds
that
interact
with
this
transporter
,
several
P

gp
assays
were
validated
and
compared
by
testing
a
set
of
28
reference
compounds
,
including
inhibitors
of
cytochrome

3A4
(
CYP3A4
)
.

The
assays
included
in

predictions
,
inhibition
assays
(
based
on
cellular
uptake
of
rhodamine

,
and
functional

(

and
transcellular

the
latter
for
a

)
.

In

in
an

indicator
screening
assay
and
test
systems
expressing

Our
results
suggest
that
several
P

assays
should
be
used
in
combination
to
classify
compounds
as
substrates
or
inhibitors
of
P

Recommendations
are
given
on
screening
strategies

5TFI
was
incorporated
into
a

murine

,
in
an
isoleucine
auxotrophic
Escherichia

host
strain
suspended

(

of
the

.

Amino
acid
analysis
showed
that
more
than
93
%
of
the
encoded
isoleucine
residues
were
replaced
by
5TFI
.

5TFI
was
successfully
introduced
into
the
cytokine
murine
interleukin

at
the
encoded

.

The

.

The
maximal
responses
are
equivalent
for
the
fluorinated
and
wild

cytokines
,
indicating
that
fluorinated
proteins
can
fold
into

3TFI

Analysis
of
plasmin
binding
and
urokinase
activation
of
plasminogen
bound
to
the
Heymann
nephritis
autoantigen
,
gp330
.

Previously
,
we
demonstrated
that
the
Heymann
nephritis
autoantigen
,
gp330
,
can
serve
as
a
receptor
site
for
plasminogen
.

This
binding
was
not
significantly
inhibited
by
the
lysine
analogue
epsilon
-
amino
caproic
acid
(
EACA
)
,
indicating
that
plasminogen
binding
was
not
just
through
lysine
binding
sites
as
suggested
for
other
plasminogen
binding
sites
.

We
now
report
that
once
plasminogen
is
bound
to
gp330
,
it
can
be
converted
to
its
active
form
of
plasmin
by
urokinase
.

This
conversion
of
plasminogen
to
plasmin
proceeds
at
a
faster
rate
when
plasminogen
is
first
prebound
to
gp330
.

Although
there
is
a
proportional
increase
in
the
Vmax
of
the
urokinase
-
catalyzed
reaction
with
increasing
gp330
concentrations
,
no
change
in
Km
was
observed
.

Once
activated
,
plasmin
remains
bound
to
gp330
in
an
active
state
capable
of
cleaving
the
chromogenic
tripeptide
,
S
-
2251
.

The
binding
of
plasmin
to
gp330
did
not
significantly
change
its
enzymatic
activity
;
however
,
gp330
did
have
a
stabilizing
effect
on
plasmin
activity
at
37
degrees
C
.

While
bound
to
gp330
,
plasmin
is
protected
from
inactivation
by
its
natural
inhibitor
alpha
2
-
antiplasmin
.

The
binding
of
plasmin
to
gp330
as
analyzed
by
ELISA
was
shown
to
be
time
dependent
,
reversible
,
saturable
,
and
specific
for
gp330
.

Inhibition
of
binding
of
both
plasminogen
and
plasmin
to
gp330
by
benzamidine
was
similar
,
although
EACA
inhibited
the
binding
of
plasmin
to
gp330
slightly
more
than
the
binding
of
plasminogen
to
gp330
.

These
results
indicate
that
the
binding
of
plasminogen
to
gp330
serves
as
an
effective
means
of
increasing
the
rate
of
plasmin
production
on
the
glomerular
and
tubular
epithelial
cell
surface
while
protecting
the
active
plasmin
from
natural
inhibitors
.

This

to
further

the
alpha

that

,
a

.

The
interactions
of
chi

conopeptide
MrIA
with
the
human
norepinephrine
transporter
(
hNET
)
were
investigated
by
determining
the
effects
of
hNET
point
mutations
on
the
inhibitory
potency
of
MrIA
.

The
mutants
were
produced
by
site
-
directed
mutagenesis
and
expressed
in
COS
-

cells
.

The
potency
of
MrIA
was
greater
for
inhibition
of
uptake
by
hNET
of
[
3H
]
norepinephrine
(
Ki

)
than
[

,
and
the
human
dopamine
transporter
and
serotonin
transporter
were
not
inhibited
by
MrIA
(
to

)
.

Of
18
mutations
where
hNET
amino
acid
residues
were
exchanged
with
those
of
the
human
dopamine
transporter
,
MrIA
had
increased
potency
for
inhibition
of
[
3H

norepinephrine
uptake
for
three
mutations
(
in
predicted
extracellular
loops
3
and
4
and

)
and
decreased
potency
for
one
mutation
(
in

and

)
.

Of
the
12
additional
mutations
in

,
4
,
5
,
and
11
and
IL1
,
three
mutations
(

had
reduced
MrIA
inhibitory
potency
.

All
of
the
other
mutations
tested
had
no
influence
on

A
comparison
of
the
results
with
previous
data
for
desipramine
and
cocaine
inhibition
of
norepinephrine
uptake
by
the
mutant
hNETs
reveals
that
MrIA
binding
to

occurs
at
a
site
that
is
distinct
from
but
overlaps
with
the

sites
for
tricyclic

From
sequence
analysis
of
the
cDNA
and
the
N

C

amino
acid
analyses
of
the
purified

,
it
is
deduced
that

consists
of
two
identical

(

each
of
which
consists

A

also
cloned
.

The

sequence
deduced
from
the
nucleotide
sequence
of

cDNA
from

was
identical
to
that
deduced
for

Northern

analysis
suggested
that
ACY
-
1
is
more
highly
expressed
in
kidney
than
in
liver
.

Comparison
of
the
amino
acid
sequence
of
porcine
ACY

with
those
of

showed
no
significant
homologies
in
either
the
overall
sequence
or
the
consensus
sequences
for
the
metal

.

This
indicates
that
ACY

is
a
new
type

.

OBJECTIVES
:
Marked

variability
exists
in

.

We
tested
the
hypothesis
that
2
common
polymorphisms
in
the
gene
for
beta
(
1
)
-
adrenergic
receptor
are
associated
with
antihypertensive
response
to

in
patients
with
uncomplicated
hypertension
.

METHODS
:
Forty
hypertensive
men
and
women
aged
35
to
65
years
were
studied
.

Baseline
studies
included
24

.

Patients
took
50

After
a
minimum
of
4
weeks
at

was
repeated
.

The

were
determined
by

was
performed
to
determine
the
impact
of

.

RESULTS
:

CONCLUSIONS
:
Our
data
suggest
that
beta
(

polymorphisms
are
important
determinants
of
antihypertensive
response
to

In
the
future
,
codon

Interaction
of
rofecoxib
and
celecoxib
with
warfarin
.

The
interaction
of
celecoxib
and
rofecoxib
with
warfarin
was
studied
.

Patients
stable
on
warfarin
therapy
and
concurrently
taking

(
COX

)
inhibitor
comparator
(
traditional
nonsteroidal
antiinflammatory
medications
,

)
randomly
received
celecoxib
200
mg

day
or
rofecoxib
25
mg
/

for
three
weeks
.

After
a
one

washout
period
,
the
patients
were
crossed
over
to
treatment
with
the
opposite
COX

inhibitor
for
three
more
weeks
.

The
International
Normalized

(
INR
)
was
measured
at
baseline
and
at
weeks
1
,
2
,
and
3
of
therapy
with
each
COX
-
2
inhibitor
by
testing
blood
samples
obtained
by
finger
stick
.

Data
for
16
patients
were
analyzed
.

The
INR
increased
by
13
%
,
6
%
,
and
5
%
on
average
in
patients
taking
celecoxib
at
weeks

,
respectively
,
and
by
5
%
,
9
%
,
and
5
%
in
patients
taking
rofecoxib
.

Changes
in
the
INR
were
statistically
significant
at
week
1
for
celecoxib
and
at
week
2
for
rofecoxib
.

Of
the
12
subjects
who
had
a
clinically
significant

15
%
change
in
the
INR
while
receiving
either
COX
-

inhibitor
,
4
showed
this
change
for
both
agents
.

Adverse
drug
reactions
were
similar
for
each
COX
-
2
inhibitor
,
but
the
rate
of
edema
requiring
medical
intervention
was
higher
in
the
rofecoxib
group
.

Significant
increases
in
the
INR
were
observed
in
patients
who
were
stable
on
warfarin
therapy
after
the
addition
of
therapy
with
rofecoxib
or
celecoxib
.

AT1
antagonism
by
eprosartan
lowers
heart
rate
variability
and
baroreflex
gain
.

INTRODUCTION
:
Blockade
of
the
renin
-
angiotensin
system
(
RAS
)
by
ACE
inhibitors
has
been
demonstrated
to
reduce
total
mortality
in
cardiovascular
diseases
.

This
advantage
was
attributed
in
part
to
changes
of
autonomic
cardiovascular
control
,
exemplified
by
an
increase
of
heart
rate
variability
(
HRV
)
and
baroreflex
gain
(
BRG
)
.

We
sought
to
assess
the
effects
of
the
angiotensin
type
1
(
AT1
)
receptor
blocker
eprosartan
on
HRV
and
BRG
.

MATERIALS
AND
METHODS
:
In
a
double
-
blind
randomized
cross
-
over
design
25
young
males
took
eprosartan
(
600
mg
/
day
)
and
placebo
each
for
a
period
of
7
days
with
a
wash
-
out
period
of
at
least
4
weeks
in
between
.

At
the
end
of
the
intake
phases
simultaneous
recordings
of
arterial
blood
pressure
(
AP
;
Finapres
)
and
electrocardiogram
(
ECG
)
were
taken
.

Power
spectra
of
HRV
and
arterial
blood
pressure
variability
(
APV
)
were
calculated
by
fast
Fourier
transform
(
FFT
)
and
served
to
calculate
BRG
.

Ang
-
II
levels
were
measured
by
radioimmunoassay
.

RESULTS
:
Eprosartan
tended
to
lower
mean
AP
,
it
slightly
increased
heart
rate
(
HR
)
(
p
<
0
.
05
)
,
and
markedly
increased
circulating
Ang
-
II
levels
(
p
<
0
.
01
)
.

Eprosartan
diminished
the
total
power
of
HRV
(
p
<
0
.
05
)
and
the
BRG
(
p
<
0
.
01
)
.

The
low
/
high
frequency
(
LF
/
HF
)
ratio
of
HRV
and
the
APV
were
not
altered
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
AT1
antagonism
by
eprosartan
lowers
heart
rate
variability
and
baroreflex
gain
.

We
speculate
that
these
findings
are
due
to
the
marked
increase
in
circulating
angiotensin
II
(
Ang
II
)
.

Further
studies
are
needed
to
clarify
whether
angiotensin
type
1
(
AT1
)
blockers
with
potential
actions
inside
the
blood
-
brain
barrier
(
BBB
)
may
have
different
effects
on
HRV
and
BRG
.

Picomol
doses
of
the
acetylated
derivative
of
beta
-
endorphin
-
(
1
-
31
)
,
injected
intracerebroventricularly
(
icv
)
in
mice
,
reduced
the
analgesic
activity
of
morphine
,
etorphine
and
beta
-
endorphin
-
(
1
-
31
)
,
while
the
efficiency
of
DAGO
and
DADLE
in
producing
analgesia
was
enhanced
.

The
effects
of
the
delta
agonists
DPDPE
and
[
D
-
Ala2
]
-
Deltorphin
II
were
not
altered
by
this
treatment
.

After
alpha
N
-
acetyl
beta
-
endorphin
-
(
1
-
31
)
injection
,
morphine
antagonized
the
analgesia
of
DAGO
.

The
regulatory
effect
of
alpha
N
-
acetyl
beta
-
endorphin
-
(
1
-
31
)
was
exhibited
when
giving
the
peptide
both
before
(
up
to
24
h
)
and
after
the
opioids
.

Naloxone
did
not
prevent
or
reverse
that
modulatory
activity
;
moreover
,
pretreatment
with
the
acetylated
peptide
did
not
change
the
pA2
value
displayed
by
the
antagonist
at
the
mu
receptor
.

The
antinociceptive
activity
of
the
alpha
2
-
adrenoceptor
agonist
clonidine
was
also
increased
in
mice
treated
with
alpha
N
-
acetyl
beta
-
endorphin
-
(
1
-
31
)
.

The
reducing
activity
of
alpha
N
-
acetyl
beta
-
endorphin
-
(
1
-
31
)
upon
morphine
-
and
beta
-
endorphin
-
induced
analgesia
was
not
exhibited
in
mice
undergoing
treatment
with
pertussis
toxin
or
N
-
ethylmaleimide
,
agents
known
to
impair
the
function
of
Gi
/
Go
transducer
proteins
.

However
,
the
enhancing
activity
displayed
by
this
peptide
upon
DAGO
-
DADLE
and
clonidine
-
evoked
antinociception
was
still
manifested
.

These
results
confirm
and
strengthen
the
idea
of
alpha
N
-
acetyl
beta
-
endorphin
-
(
1
-
31
)
acting
as
a
non
-
competitive
regulator
of
mu
opioid
-
and
alpha
2
-
adrenoceptor
-
mediated
supraspinal
antinociception
.

A
neural
substrate
acted
on
by
both
receptors
(
likely
Gi
/
Go
transducer
proteins
)
appears
to
be
involved
in
the
effects
of
that
neuropeptide
.

Effects
of
loperamide
on
the
human
hypothalamo

axis
in
vivo
and
in
vitro
.

Loperamide
,
an
opiate
agonist
of
high
specificity
for
mu
-
receptors
,
was
recently
reported
to
suppress
ACTH
and
cortisol
levels
in
normal
subjects
,
but
not
in
patients
with
proven
ACTH

However
,
there
is
little
information
on
the
site
of
action
of
loperamide
in
the
hypothalamo

We
investigated
the

.

In

,
neither
the
ACTH
peak

affected
by
loperamide
.

In
six
patients
with

patient
with
secondary

insufficiency
due
to

,
neither

were
influenced

In

corticotropic
adenomas
,
loperamide
was
not
able
to
reduce

In

,
loperamide
is
able
to
reduce
basal

ACTH

cortisol
levels
in
normal
subjects
,
but
not
in
patients
with

Loperamide
has
no

-
induced
ACTH

and
,
therefore
,
no

Loperamide
might
act

Effects

In
the
present
study
the
inhibition
by
nedocromil
sodium
of
the
specific
receptor
binding
of
FMLP
was
evaluated
in
human
neutrophils
(
PMNs
)
using
a
FMLP
-
(
3H
)
binding
assay
.

The
time
course
of
the
binding
was
markedly
influenced
by
nedocromil
sodium
used
at
a
concentration
of
300
microM
.

No
significant
inhibition
was
obtained
when
the
cells
were
treated
with
nedocromil
sodium
3
microM
or
with
sodium
cromoglycate
300
microM
.

FMLP
binding
is
essentially
eliminated
by
the
highest
dose
of
nedocromil
sodium
.

The
biologic
meaning
of
this
effect
in
asthmatic
patients
should
be
further
evaluated
.

Effects
of
nedocromil
sodium
and
WEB
2086
on
chemoattractant
-
stimulated
neutrophil
migration
through
cellular
and
noncellular
barriers
.

Nedocromil
sodium
(
Tilade
)
is
an
effective
therapeutic
agent
against
asthma
and
has
been
shown
to
exhibit
antiinflammatory
activity
in
vitro
;
however
,
its
mode
of
action
is
yet
to
be
described
fully
.

Using
an
in
vitro
assay
designed
to
mimic
the
extravasation
of
neutrophils
from
the
peripheral
circulation
through
cellular
barriers
to
sites
of
inflammation
,
the
effect
of
nedocromil
sodium
on
chemoattractant
-
stimulated
neutrophil
migration
was
examined
.

We
also
examined
the
effects
of
WEB
2086
,
a
platelet
-
activating
factor
(
PAF
)
receptor
antagonist
,
in
parallel
.

Neutrophils
and
the
cellular
barrier
were
pretreated
and
/
or
co
-
incubated
with
nedocromil
or
WEB
2086
and
the
effects
on
neutrophil
chemotaxis
measured
.

In
all
treatments
,
nedocromil
did
not
significantly
affect
chemotaxis
through
cellular
or
noncellular
barriers
to
N
-
formyl
-
methionyl
-
leucyl
-
phenylalanine
(
FMLP
)
,
leukotriene
B4
(
LTB4
)
,
or
PAF
.

In
contrast
,
WEB
2086
inhibited
PAF
-
induced
neutrophil
migration
through
both
naked
filters
and
endothelial
and
epithelial
monolayers
cultured
on
these
filters
.

We
conclude
that
while
nedocromil
has
been
shown
to
have
inhibitory
effects
on
neutrophils
and
is
an
effective
therapeutic
agent
for
asthma
and
inflammatory
conditions
,
its
activity
is
not
primarily
mediated
by
inhibition
of
neutrophil
chemotaxis
.

Platelet

antagonists
may
partially
be
effective
in
asthma

inhibitory

Ocular
beta
-
blockers
in
glaucoma
management
.

Clinical
pharmacological
aspects
.

Topical
beta
-
blockers
reduce
the
intraocular
pressure
(
IOP
)
by
blockade
of
sympathetic
nerve
endings
in
the
ciliary
epithelium
causing
a
fall
in
aqueous
humour
production
.

Two
types
of
topical
beta
-
blockers
are
available
for
use
in
glaucoma
:
nonselective
,
which
block
both
beta
1
-
and
beta
2
-
adrenoceptors
;
and
cardioselective
,
which
block
only
beta
1
-
receptors
.

Of
the
beta
-
Blockers
commercially
available
,
timolol
,
levobunolol
,
metipranolol
and
carteolol
are
nonselective
,
and
betaxolol
is
cardioselective
.

Twice
-
daily
timolol
is
probably
the
most
effective
agent
in
lowering
IOP
,
although
levobunolol
is
equally
effective
and
can
be
used
once
daily
with
little
difference
in
effect
.

Carteolol
is
used
twice
daily
and
any
theoretical
advantage
in
diminished
side
effects
conferred
by
its
partial
beta
-
agonist
activity
compared
with
timolol
has
not
been
fully
substantiated
.

Metipranolol
is
effective
twice
daily
and
does
not
have
partial
beta
-
agonist
activity
.

Betaxolol
has
an
effect
comparable
to
timolol
in
lowering
IOP
,
but
is
less
effective
in
some
patients
.

beta
-
Blockers
can
be
used
with
other
antiglaucoma
medications
,
but
their
combined
action
with
epinephrine
(
adrenaline
)
is
suspect
,
particularly
in
the
case
of
the
nonselective
beta
-
blockers
,
and
the
effect
should
be
assessed
in
patients
on
an
individual
basis
.

Local
stinging
can
be
a
problem
in
some
patients
with
betaxolol
.

The
most
serious
side
effects
of
beta
-
blockers
are
the
exacerbation
of
chronic
obstructive
airways
disease
with
nonselective
agents
and
the
precipitation
of
bronchospasm
in
some
patients
.

Betaxolol
seems
relatively
free
of
adverse
respiratory
effects
,
although
this
may
be
dose
-
related
and
extreme
caution
should
still
be
exercised
in
patients
with
any
history
of
respiratory
illness
.

Because
of
the
lower
risk
of
precipitating
side
effects
,
betaxolol
is
probably
the
beta
-
blocker
of
first
choice
for
use
in
glaucoma
;
timolol
or
levobunolol
are
reserved
for
patients
who
do
not
respond
satisfactorily
to
betaxolol
and
are
quite
free
of
respiratory
disease
.

5
-
Lipoxygenase
inhibitors
for
the
treatment
of
inflammatory
bowel
disease
.

The
unique
role
of
the
enzyme
5
-
lipoxygenase
(
5
-
LO
)
in
the
production
of
leukotrienes
(
LTs
)
makes
it
a
likely
target
for
biochemical
manipulation
.

The
rationale
for
using
5
-
LO
inhibitors
for
the
treatment
of
inflammatory
bowel
disease
(
IBD
)
is
based
on
the
increased
generation
of
LTs
in
the
inflamed
mucosa
,
LTB4
being
the
most
potent
chemotactic
and
chemokinetic
metabolite
of
arachidonic
acid
.

Furthermore
,
conventional
drugs
,
such
as
corticosteroids
,
sulphasalazine
,
and
5
-
aminosalicylic
acid
,
inhibit
LT
production
and
specific
5
-
LO
inhibition
accelerates
healing
in
animal
models
of
acute
colitis
.

The
compounds
identified
as
5
-
LO
inhibitors
can
be
divided
into
antioxidants
,
substrate
-
analogous
,
and
a
large
miscellaneous
group
of
inhibitors
,
where
hydroxamic
acids
are
potent
and
more
selective
inhibitors
of
5
-
LO
.

The
benzothiophene
hydroxyurea
,
zileuton
,
is
the
first
selective
5
-
LO
inhibitor
evaluated
for
the
treatment
of
patients
with
IBD
.

An
800
-
mg
oral
dose
of
zileuton
was
shown
to
reduce
LTB4
,
but
not
prostaglandin
E2
,
concentrations
by
75
-
85
%
in
rectal
dialysates
from
patients
with
active
ulcerative
colitis
.

The
clinical
efficacy
of
zileuton
800
mg
b
.
i
.
d
.
has
also
been
tested
in
a
randomized
,
double
-
blind
,
placebo
-
controlled
trial
in
similar
patients
.

Zileuton
significantly
improved
the
symptom
scores
and
the
histology
score
,
but
not
the
sigmoidoscopy
score
,
compared
to
pretreatment
conditions
and
with
response
to
placebo
,
the
beneficial
effects
being
most
pronounced
in
patients
not
receiving
concomitant
sulphasalazine
treatment
.

The
mean
inhibition
of
LTB4
in
the
target
tissue
of
inflammation
was
70
%
.

The
proof
that
any
putative
5
-
LO
inhibitor
is
blocking
LT
production
is
an
important
stage
in
assessing
any
such
drug
.

The
main
disadvantage
of
existing
new
LT
inhibitors
relates
to
the
high
potency
of
LTs
,
and
unless
a
higher
level
of
inhibition
can
be
achieved
,
endogenous
LTs
may
still
be
present
in
sufficient
amounts
to
produce
their
effects
.

Platelet
-
derived
growth
factor
(
PDGF
)
is
a
potent
mitogen
for
mesenchymal
cells
.

PDGF
AA
functions
as
a
"
competent
factor
"
that
stimulates
cell
cycle
entry
but
requires
additional
(
progression
)
factors
in
serum
to
transit
the
cell
cycle
beyond
the
G1
/
S
checkpoint
.

Unlike
PDGF
AA
,
PDGF
B
-
chain
(
c

sis
)
homodimer
(
PDGF
BB
)
and
its
viral
counterpart
v
-
sis
can
serve
as
both
competent
and
progression
factors
.

PDGF
BB
activates
alpha

and
beta

receptor
subunits
(
alpha
-
PDGFR
and
beta
-
PDGFR
)
and
induces
phenotypic
transformation
in
NIH
3T3
cells
,
whereas
PDGF
AA
activates
alpha
-
PDGFR
only
and
fails
to
induce
transformation
.

We
showed
previously
that
alpha
-
PDGFR
antagonizes
beta

PDGFR

mediated
transformation
through
activation
of
stress
-
activated
protein

NH2
-
terminal

-

,
whereas
both
alpha
-
PDGFR
and
beta
-
PDGFR
induce
mitogenic
signals
.

These
studies
revealed
a
striking
feature
of
PDGF
signaling
;
the
specificity
and
the
strength
of
the
PDGF
growth
signal
is
modulated
by
alpha
-
PDGFR
-
mediated
simultaneous
activation
of
growth
stimulatory
and
inhibitory
signals
,
whereas
beta
-
PDGFR
mainly
induces
a
growth
-
promoting
signal
.

Here
we
demonstrate
that
PDGF
BB
activation
of
beta
-
PDGFR
alone
results
in
more
efficient
cell
cycle
transition
from
G1
to
S
phase
than
PDGF
BB
activation
of
both
alpha
-
PDGFR
and
beta
-
PDGFR
.

PDGF

both

and

an

of

and
a

of
the
tumor

gene
product
p53
.

However
,
beta
-
PDGFR
activation
alone
fails
to
induce
p21WAF1
/
CIP1
expression
.

We
also
demonstrate
that
alpha
-
PDGFR
-
activated
JNK
-
1
is
a
critical
signaling
component
for
PDGF
induction
of
p21WAF1

activity
.

The
ability
of
PDGF

JNK

1
to
induce
p21WAF1

CIP1

activity
is
independent
of
p53
,
although
the
overall
p21WAF1
/
CIP1
promoter
activities
are
greatly
reduced
in
the
absence
of

These
results
provide
a

Searching

the
daily
rhythm
of
cardiovascular
risk
factors
during

Previous
studies
have
shown
that
Japanese
taxi
drivers
are
exposed
to
more
risk
factors
and
have
a
higher
mortality
rate
due
to
cardiovascular
disease
than
other
occupational
groups
.

We
investigated
the
effect
of
night
taxi
driving
with
a
view
to
preventing
acute
events
of
cardiovascular
disease
among
aged
taxi
drivers
.

Twenty

(
41

were
examined
for

day
and
in
the
following
morning
.

At
the
same
time
,
the
blood
pressure
and
blood

of
46
taxi
drivers
(
43
-
67
years
old
)
in
the
morning
after
a
night
duty
with
little
sleep
and
in
the
morning
after
daytime
work
and
subsequent
night
sleep
were
compared
.

The
results
obtained
indicate
that
the
aggravation
of
sympathetic
nervous
system
functions
with
disturbed
circadian
rhythms
,
increased
blood
coagulation
and
blood
concentration
,
endothelial
injury
and
the
elevation
of
blood
glucose
at
midnight
or
the
next
morning
were
induced
by
their
night
work
.

These
conditions
are
supposed
to
favour
acute
vascular
events
in
aged
taxi
drivers
.

Preventive
measures
considered
include
social
support
for
anticoagulant
food
and

intake
,
short

The
human
ribonucleotide
reductase
subunit
hRRM2
complements
p53R2
in
response
to
UV
-
induced
DNA
repair
in
cells
with
mutant
p53
.

Ribonucleotide
reductase
(
RR
)
is
responsible
for
the
de
novo
conversion
of
the
ribonucleoside
diphosphates
to
deoxyribonucleoside
diphosphates
,
which
are
essential
for
DNA
synthesis
and
repair
.

RR
consists
of
two
subunits
,
hRRM1
and
hRRM2
.

p53R2
is
a
new
RR
family
member
.

Because
the
majority
of
human
tumors
possess
mutant
p53
,
it
is
important
to
know
the
molecular
mechanism
by
which
mutant
p53
regulates
RR
and
to
what
extent
.

In
this
study
,
we
investigated
the
expression
and
function
of
p53R2
and
hRRM2
after
UV
treatment
in
human
prostate
cancer
PC3
cells
,
which
possess
mutant
p53
with
a
truncated
COOH
-
terminal
,
and
in
human
oropharyngeal
cancer
KB
cells
,
which
possess
wild
-
type
p53
.

p53R2
(
analyzed
by
Western
blot
and
standardized
relative
to
Coomassie
Blue
-
stained
band
)
was
down
-
regulated
in
PC3
cells
and
up
-
regulated
in
KB
cells
after
UV
exposure
.

In
contrast
,
hRRM2
was
up
-
regulated
by
UV
in
both
PC3
cells
and
KB
cells
.

hRRM2
and
p53R2
mRNA
levels
were
assessed
by
Northern
blot
,
and
the
results
paralleled
that
of
the
Western
blot
.

Coimmunoprecipitation
assays
using
agarose
-
conjugated
goat
antihuman
RRM1
antibody
confirmed
that
the
p53R2
binding
to
hRRM1
decreased
in
PC3
cells
but
increased
in
KB
cells
after
UV
treatment
.

hRRM2
binding
to
hRRM1
increased
in
both
cell
lines
under
the
same
conditions
.

These
results
suggest
that
PC3
cells
are
deficient
in
both
transcription
of
p53R2
and
binding
to
hRRM1
in
response
to
UV
irradiation
.

Confocal
microscopy
further
confirmed
that
these
findings
were
not
due
to
translocation
of
hRRM2
and
p53R2
from
the
cytoplasm
to
the
nucleus
.

RR
activity
was
measured
following
UV
treatment
and
shown
to
increase
in
PC3
cells
.

It
was
unchanged
in
proportional
of
KB
cells
.

The
RR
activity
is
consistent
with
the
expression
of
hRRM2
seen
in
the
Western
blots
.

Thus
,
we
hypothesize
that
hRRM2
complements
p53R2
to
form
RR
holoenzyme
and
maintain
RR
activity
in
PC3
cells
after
UV
treatment
.

To
further
confirm
this
hypothesis
,
we
examined
the
effect
of
RRM2
inhibitors
on
cells
exposed
to
UV
.

In
PC3
cells
,
hydroxyurea
inhibited
hRRM2
and
resulted
in
increased
sensitivity
to
UV
irradiation
.

We
also
examined
the
effect
of
UV
treatment
on
the
colony
-
forming
ability
of
cells
transfected
with
hRRM2
as
well
as
p53R2
sense
or
antisense
expression
vectors
.

Expression
of
antisense
hRRM2
in
PC3
cells
led
to
decreased
hRRM2
expression
and
resulted
in
greater
sensitivity
to
UV
than
observed
in
wild
-
type
PC3
cells
.

Taken
together
,
we
conclude
that
UV
-
induced
activation
of
p53R2
transcription
and
binding
of
p53R2
to
hRRM1
to
form
RR
holoenzyme

Minocycline
reduces
cell
death
and
improves
functional
recovery
after
traumatic
spinal
cord
injury
in
the
rat
.

We
examined
the
effects
of
minocycline
,
an
anti
-
inflammatory
drug
,
on
functional
recovery
following
spinal
cord
injury
(
SCI
)
.

Rats
received
a
mild
,
weight
-
drop
contusion
injury
to
the
spinal
cord
and
were
treated
with
the
vehicle
or
minocycline
at
a
dose
of
90
mg
/
kg
immediately
after
SCI
and
then
twice
at
a
dose
of
45
mg
/
kg
every
12
h
.

Injecting
minocycline
after

improved

function
as
determined
by
the
Basso

Beattie
-
Bresnahan
(
BBB
)
locomotor
open
field
behavioral

test
.

Twenty
four
to
38
days
after
SCI
,
BBB
scores
were
significantly
higher
in
minocycline
-
treated
rats
as
compared
with
those
in
vehicle
-
treated
rats
.

Morphological
analysis
showed
that
lesion
size
increased
progressively
in
both
vehicle
-
treated
and
minocycline
-
treated
spinal
cords
.

However
,
in
response
to
treatment
with
minocycline
,
the
lesion
size
was
significantly
reduced
at
21
-
38
days
after
SCI
when
compared
to
the
vehicle
control
.

Minocycline
treatment
significantly
reduced
the
number
of
terminal
deoxynucleotidyl

(
TdT
)
-
mediated
deoxyuridine
triphosphate
-
biotin

(
TUNEL
)
-
positive
cells
24
h
after
SCI
as
compared
to
that
of
the
vehicle
control
.

DNA
gel
electrophoresis
also
revealed
a
marked
decrease
in
DNA
laddering
in
response
to
treatment
with
minocycline
.

In
addition
,
minocycline
treatment
significantly
reduced
the
specific
caspase
-
3
activity
after
SCI
as
compared
to
that
of
vehicle
control
.

Furthermore
,
RT
-
PCR
analyses
revealed
that
minocycline
treatment
increased
expression
of
interleukin
-
10
mRNA
but
decreased
tumor
necrosis
factor
-
alpha
expression
.

These
data
suggest
that
,
after
SCI
,
minocycline
treatment
modulated
expression
of
cytokines
,
attenuated
cell
death
and
the
size
of
lesions
,
and
improved
functional
recovery
in
the
injured
rat
.

This
approach
may
provide
a
therapeutic
intervention
enabling
us
to
reduce
cell
death
and
improve
functional
recovery
after
SCI
.

Innovative
approach
for
improvement
of
an
antibiotic
-
overproducing
industrial
strain
of
Streptomyces
albus
.

Working
with
a
Streptomyces
albus
strain
that
had
previously
been
bred
to
produce
industrial
amounts
(
10
mg
/
ml
)
of
salinomycin
,
we
demonstrated
the
efficacy
of
introducing
drug
resistance
-
producing
mutations
for
further
strain
improvement
.

Mutants
with
enhanced
salinomycin
production
were
detected
at
a
high
incidence
(
7
to
12
%
)
among
spontaneous
isolates
resistant
to
streptomycin
(
Str
(
r
)
)
,
gentamicin
,
or
rifampin
(
Rif
(
r
)
)
.

Finally
,
we
successfully
demonstrated
improvement
of
the
salinomycin
productivity
of
the
industrial
strain
by
2
.
3
-
fold
by
introducing
a
triple
mutation
.

The
Str
(
r
)
mutant
was
shown
to
have
a
point
mutation
within
the
rpsL
gene
(
encoding
ribosomal
protein
S12
)
.

Likewise
,
the
Rif
(
r
)
mutant
possessed
a
mutation
in
the
rpoB
gene
(
encoding
the
RNA
polymerase
beta
subunit
)
.

Increased
productivity
of
salinomycin
in
the
Str
(
r
)
mutant
(
containing
the
K88R
mutation
in
the
S12
protein
)
may
be
a
result
of
an
aberrant
protein
synthesis
mechanism
.

This
aberration
may
manifest
itself
as
enhanced
translation
activity
in
stationary
-
phase
cells
,
as
we
have
observed
with
the
poly
(
U
)
-
directed
cell
-
free
translation
system
.

The
K88R
mutant
ribosome
was
characterized
by
increased
70S
complex
stability
in
low
Mg
(
2
+
)
concentrations
.

We
conclude
that
this
aberrant
protein
synthesis
ability
in
the
Str
(
r
)
mutant
,
which
is
a
result
of
increased
stability
of
the
70S
complex
,
is
responsible
for
the
remarkable
salinomycin
production
enhancement
obtained
.

The
effects
of
nandrolone
phenylpropionate
on
androgen
receptor
of
liver
and
sexual
glands
in
burned
rats
]
.

OBJECTIVE
:
To
assess
the
effects
of
nandrolone
phenylpropionate
(
NP
)
on
androgen
receptor
(
AR
)
of
liver
and
sexual
glands
in
burned
rats
for
supporting
the
clinical
application
of
anabolic
steroids
.

METHODS
:
Thirty
-
two
Wistar
rats
with
a
deep
second
-
degree
cutaneous
burn
of
20
%
total
body
surface
area
were
randomly
divided
into
two
groups
to
receive
either
5
mg
/
kg
NP
(
NP
group
)
or
normal
saline
as
placebo
(
control
group
)
every
other
day
.

The
mean
integrated
optical
density
(
mIOD
)
of
androgen
receptor
(
AR
)
in
liver
,
testis
,
ovary
tissues
were
measured
by
immunohistochemistry
ENVISION
and
LSAB
respectively
on
the
4th
,
7th
,
14th
and
21st
days
after
scalding
.

RESULTS
:
The
density
of
AR
in
liver
tissue
in
NP
group
was
higher
than
that
in
control
group
(
P
<
0
.
05
)
.

The
density
of
AR
in
testis
and
ovary
tissues
showed
no
significant
difference
between
NP
group
and
control
group
at
every
time
-
point
(
P
>
0
.
05
)
.

The
side
-
effect
of
NP
at
this
dose
level
on
sexual
glands
seemed
limited
.

CONCLUSION
:
Nandrolone
phenylpropionate
up
-
regulated
the
density
of
AR
in
liver
tissue
,
whereas
it
had
no
significant
effects
on
the
density
of
AR
in
testis
and
ovary
tissues
.

NP
was
used
with
safety
at
this

pulmonary
hypertension
.

OBJECTIVE
:
Appetite
-
suppressant
drug
fenfluramine
is
implicated
in
primary
pulmonary
hypertension
(
PPH
)
but
the
molecular
pathways
that
mediate
this
effect
are
unknown
.

A
mouse
model
incriminates
the
serotonin
5
-
HT
(
2B
)
receptor
but
contrasts
with
other
models
where
this
receptor
has
been
shown
to
mediate
pulmonary
arterial
relaxation
via
nitric
oxide
production
.

METHODS
:
We
analyzed
the
human
5
-
HT
(
2B
)
gene
in
10
patients
with
appetite
-
suppressant
drug
-
associated
PPH
.

RESULTS
:
A
mutation
causing
premature
truncation
of
the
protein
product
was
found
in
one
patient
.

The
mutation
was
not
found
in
80
control
subjects
and
no
5
-
HT
(
2B
)
mutation
was
found
in
18
PPH
patients
not
associated
with
appetite
-
suppressants
.

Functional
analysis
of
the
transfected
receptor
expressed
either
transiently
in
COS
cells
or
stably
in
CHO
cells
demonstrated
that
the
mutated
receptor
fails
to
activate
the
second
messenger
inositol
-
phosphates
cascade
and
subsequent
intracellular
calcium
release
,
in
spite
of
normal
expression
at
the
cell
membrane
.

The
mutated
receptor
had
no
constitutive
activity
,
and
produced
no
dominant
negative
effect
on
the
wild
-
type
receptor
.

CONCLUSION
:
Loss
of
serotonin
5
-
HT
(
2B
)
receptor
function
may
predispose
to
fenfluramine
-
associated
PPH
in

The
antileukemia
drug

antagonist
.

The
nucleoside
analog
2
-
chloro
-
2
'
-
deoxyadenosine
(
CldAdo
;
cladribine
)
is
effective
in
the
treatment
of
hairy
cell
leukemia
and
chronic
lymphocytic
leukemia
.

CldAdo
is
phosphorylated
and
incorporated
into
cellular
DNA
but
is
not
an
absolute
chain
terminator
.

We
demonstrated
by
in
vitro
gel
-
shift
assays
that
binding
interactions
of
the
human
TATA
box
-
binding
protein
(
TBP
)
were
disrupted
on
2
-
chlorodeoxyadenosine
monophosphate
(
CldAMP
)
-
substituted
TATA
box
consensus
sequences
.

We
hypothesized
that
human
RNA
polymerase
II
(
pol
II
)
transcriptional
processes
would
therefore
be
affected
by
2
-
chlorodeoxyadenosine
triphosphate
(
CldATP
)
incorporation
into
a
promoter
TATA
element
.

Double
-
stranded
DNA
templates
containing
the
adenovirus
major
late
promoter
and
coding
sequences
were
enzymatically
synthesized
as
control
or
with
site
-
specific
CldAMP
residues
,
incubated
with
HeLa
extract
,
and
the
synthesis
of
radiolabeled
44
-
base
transcripts
was
assessed
.

With
increasing
amounts
of
HeLa
extract
,
CldAMP
substitution
for
dAMP
within
the
TATA
box
decreased
in
vitro
pol
II
transcription
by
approximately
35
%
compared
with
control
substrates
.

Time
-
course
studies
showed
that
transcript
production
increased
in
a
linear
fashion
on
control
substrates
.

In
contrast
,
transcription
on
CldAMP
-
substituted
TATA
sequences
reached
a
plateau
after
20
min
.

Furthermore
,
CldAMP
-
substituted
promoter
sequences
trapped
or
sequestered
TBP
,
preventing
its
dissociation
from
DNA
and
subsequent
binding
to
additional
TATA
elements
to
reinitiate
transcription
.

CldAdo
thus
represents
the
first
example
of
a
nucleoside
analog
that
acts
as
a
transcriptional
antagonist
.

CldATP
incorporation
into
gene
regulatory
sequences
may
provide
a
novel
strategy
to
modulate
specific
protein
/
DNA
interactions
.

for
1
week
to
induce

induced
a
59
%
down

regulation
of
left

beta
(
2
)
-
adrenoceptors
compared
to

.

The
extent
of
the
isoprenaline

was
significantly
reduced
in
both
the
bisoprolol

permeable
channel
,
which
can
be
activated
by
low

It
belongs
to
the

,
and
therefore
is
related
to
vanilloid

.

We
tested
whether
substances
which
are
structurally

or
which
produce
a

could
activate
TRPM8

with
a
range
of
tranylcypromine
concentrations
in
the
presence
of
each
of
the
CYP
enzymes
at
37
degrees
C
for
a
predetermined
period
of
time
.

Product
concentrations
were
quantified
by
HPLC
with
UV
detection
.

.

The
results
demonstrated
that
tranylcypromine
is
a
competitive
inhibitor
of
CYP2C19
(
Ki
=
32
microM
)
and
CYP2D6
(
Ki
=
367
microM
)
and
a
noncompetitive
inhibitor
of
CYP2C9
(
Ki
=
56
microM
)
.

.

None
of
these
inhibitory
effects
are
considered
clinically
significant
at
usual
therapeutic
doses
.

However
,
in
certain
situations
such
as
high
dose
tranylcypromine
therapy
,
or
in
poor
metabolizers
of
CYP2C19
substrates
,
clinically
significant
interactions
might
occur
,
particularly
when
tranylcypromine
is
coadministered
with
drugs
with
a
narrow
therapeutic
index
.

Organization
and
expression
of
the
SLC36
cluster
of
amino
acid
transporter
genes
.

Three
closely
related
genes
encoding
amino
acid
transport
proteins
are
clustered
on
5q32
in
humans
,
and
Chromosome
(
Chr
)
11
in
mice
.

The
human
SLC36A1
gene
,
which
encodes
the
lysosomal
amino
acid
transporter
LYAAT1
/
PAT1
,
generates
multiple
alternative
mRNAs
,
some
of
which
encode
truncated
proteins
.

SLC36A1
is
expressed
in
numerous
tissues
,
whereas
expression
of
SLC36A2
,
which
encodes
the
glycine
transporter
tramdorinl
/
PAT2
,
is
most
abundant
in
kidney
and
muscle
.

Expression
of
a
third
gene
,
SLC36A3
,
is
restricted
to
testis
.

Mouse
Slc36a2
also
is
expressed
in
bone
and
fat
tissue
.

Polymorphisms
in
human
SLC36A2
exclude
it
as
a
candidate
locus
for
a
peripheral
neuropathy
that
has
been
mapped
to
5q31
-
33
.

SLC36A2
is
a
candidate
gene
for
5q
-
myelodysplastic
syndrome
,
on
the
basis
of
its
chromosomal
location
and
its
expression
in

ATR
regulates
a
G2

phase
cell

cycle
checkpoint
in
Arabidopsis
thaliana
.

Ataxia
telangiectasia
-
mutated
and
Rad3
-
related
(
ATR
)
plays
a
central
role
in
cell
-
cycle
regulation
,
transmitting
DNA
damage
signals
to
downstream
effectors
of
cell
-
cycle
progression
.

In
animals
,
ATR
is
an
essential
gene
.

Here
,
we
find
that
Arabidopsis
(
Arabidopsis

)
atr
-
/
-
mutants
were
viable
,
fertile
,
and
phenotypically
wild
-
type
in
the
absence
of
exogenous
DNA
damaging
agents
but
exhibit
altered
expression
of
AtRNR1
(
ribonucleotide
reductase
large
subunit
)
and
alteration
of
some
damage
-
induced
cell

cycle
checkpoints
.
atr
mutants
were
hypersensitive
to
hydroxyurea
(
HU
)
,
aphidicolin
,
and
UV
-
B
light
but
only
mildly
sensitive
to
gamma

radiation
.

G2
arrest
was
observed
in
response
to
gamma
-
irradiation
in
both
wild
-
type
and
atr
plants
,
albeit
with
slightly
different
kinetics
,
suggesting
that
ATR
plays
a
secondary
role
in
response
to
double
-
strand
breaks
.

G2
arrest
also
was
observed
in
wild
-
type
plants
in
response
to
aphidicolin
but
was
defective
in
atr
mutants
,
resulting
in
compaction
of
nuclei
and
subsequent
cell
death
.

By
contrast
,
HU
-
treated
wild
-
type
and
atr
plants
arrested
in
G1
and
showed
no
obvious
signs
of
cell
death
.

We
propose
that
,
in
plants
,
HU
invokes
a
novel
checkpoint
responsive
to
low
levels
of
deoxynucleotide
triphosphates
.

These
results
demonstrate
the
important
role
of
cell
-
cycle
checkpoints
in
the
ability
of
plant
cells
to
sense
and
cope
with
problems
associated
with
DNA
replication

Selective
activation
of
thyroid
hormone
signaling
pathways
by
GC
-
1
:
a
new
approach
to
controlling
cholesterol
and
body
weight
.

The
current
report
describes
progress
in
development
of
a
selective
thyroid
hormone
receptor
modulator
,
GC
-
1
.

This
compound
binds
selectively
to
the
beta
-
isoform
of
the
thyroid
hormone
receptor
,
and
its
uptake
into
the
heart
is
relatively
low
.

Studies
in
rats
,
mice
and
monkeys
show
that
GC
-
1
lowers
cholesterol
with
600
-
to
1400
-
fold
more
potency
and
approximately
two
-
to
threefold
more
efficacy
than
atorvastatin
,
a
compound
that
blocks
HMG
-
CoA
reductase
.

GC
-
1
also
decreases
plasma
levels
of
triglyceride
and
lipoprotein
(
a
)
,
and
induces
loss
of
fat
.

These
effects
can
be
observed
under
conditions
where
there
is
either
no
or
minimal
effect
on
heart
rate
,
and
no
detectable
loss
of
muscle
.

Although
more
study
is
required
,
compounds
of
this
class
deserve
further
investigation
for
treating
lipid
disorders
and
obesity
.

Flt3
receptor
tyrosine
kinase
as
a
drug
target
in
leukemia
.

The
hematopoietic
class
III
receptor
tyrosine
kinase
(
RTK
)
Flt3
(
Flk2
,
STK1
)
has
recently
received
much
attention
as
a
potential
drug
target
.

Activation
of
Flt3
by
different
types
of
mutations
plays
an
important
role
for
proliferation
,
resistance
to
apoptosis
,
and
prevention
of
differentiation
of
leukemic
blasts
in
acute
myeloid
leukemia
(
AML
)
.

At
least
one
type
of
such
mutations
-
an
internal
tandem
duplication
in
the
Flt3
juxtamembrane
domain
(
Flt3
-
ITD
)
-
has
been
associated
with
an
unfavorable
prognosis
.

Signal
transduction
of
Flt3
involves
activation
of
several
conserved
pathways
,
including
the
RAS
/
MAP
-
Kinase
and
the
phosphoinositide
-
3
-
kinase
/
Akt
signaling
cascades
.

Transforming
versions
of
Flt3
exhibit
altered
signaling
,
for
example
a
very
pronounced
activation
of
STAT5
,
ultimately
resulting
in
alternate
profiles
of
gene
expression
and
cell
transformation
.

Selective
inhibitors
of
Flt3
tyrosine
kinase
activity
have
the
potential
to
suppress
aberrant
Flt3
signaling
.

Although
highly
homologous
to
other
class
III
RTKs
,
Flt3
is
resistant
to
the
phenylaminopyrimidine
STI571
(
Gleevec
,
Imatinib
)
,
a
potent
inhibitor
of
other
RTKs
in
the
family
,
such
as
the
PDGFbeta
-
receptor
or
c
-
Kit
.

STI571
binding
to
Flt3
is
prevented
by
the
phenylalanine
691
side
-
chain
in
the
ATP
binding
center
and
mutating
this
site
to
threonine
renders
the
corresponding
Flt3
mutant
sensitive
to
STI571
.

Compounds
of
several
other
structural
families
,
including
the
quinoxaline
AG1296
,
the
bis
(
1H
-
2
-
indolyl
)
-

-
methanone
D
-
65476
,
the
indolinones
SU5416
and
SU11248
,
the
indolocarbazoles
PKC412
and
CEP
-
701
,
and
the
piperazonyl
quinazoline
CT53518
,
are
potent
inhibitors
of
Flt3
kinase
.

They
exhibit
different
selectivity
profiles
,
both
with
respect
to
other
kinases
and
among
wildtype
Flt3
and
its
activated
versions
.

These
compounds
hold
promise
as
novel
drugs
against
AML
and
as
probes
for
understanding
activation
mechanisms
and
signaling
pathways
in
the
class
III
RTK
family
.

Novel
mechanism
of
action
for
hydralazine
:
induction
of
hypoxia
-
inducible
factor
-
1alpha
,
vascular
endothelial
growth
factor
,
and
angiogenesis
by
inhibition
of
prolyl
hydroxylases
.

The
vasodilator
hydralazine
,
used
clinically
in
cardiovascular
therapy
,
relaxes
arterial
smooth
muscle
by
inhibiting
accumulation
of
intracellular
free
Ca2
+
via
an
unidentified
primary
target
.

Collagen
prolyl
hydroxylase
is
a
known
target
of
hydralazine
.

We
therefore
investigated
whether
inhibition
of
other
members
of
this
enzyme
family
,
namely
the
hypoxia
-
inducible
factor
(
HIF
)
-
regulating
O2
-
dependent
prolyl
hydroxylase
domain
(
PHD
)
enzymes
,
could
represent
a
novel
mechanism
of
action
.

Hydralazine
induced
rapid
and
transient
expression
of
HIF
-
1alpha
and
downstream
targets
of
HIF
(
endothelin
-
1
,
adrenomedullin
,
haem
oxygenase
1
,
and
vascular
endothelial
growth
factor
[
VEGF
]
)
in
endothelial
and
smooth
muscle
cells
and
induced
endothelial
cell
-
specific
proliferation
.

Hydralazine
dose
-
dependently
inhibited
PHD
activity
and
induced
nonhydroxylated
HIF
-
1alpha
,
evidence
for
HIF
stabilization
specifically
by
inhibition
of
PHD
enzyme
activity
.

In
vivo
,
hydralazine
induced
HIF
-
1alpha
and
VEGF
protein
in
tissue
extracts
and
elevated
plasma
VEGF
levels
.

In
sponge
angiogenesis
assays
,
hydralazine
increased
stromal
cell
infiltration
and
blood
vessel
density
versus
control
animals
.

Thus
,
hydralazine
activates
the
HIF
pathway
through
inhibition
of
PHD
activity
and
initiates
a
pro
-
angiogenic
phenotype
.

This
represents
a
novel
mechanism
of
action
for
hydralazine
and
presents
HIF
as
a
potential
target
for
treatment
of
ischemic
disease
.

Determination
of
expression
of
cyclooxygenase
-
1
and
-
2
isozymes
in
canine
tissues
and
their
differential
sensitivity
to
nonsteroidal
anti
-
inflammatory
drugs
.

OBJECTIVE
:
To
evaluate
cyclooxygenase
isozyme
distribution
in
tissues
from
dogs
and
determine
the
differential
sensitivity
of
canine
cyclooxygenase
(
COX
)
-
1
and
-
2
isozymes
to
nonsteroidal
anti
-
inflammatory
drugs
(
NSAIDs
)
.

SAMPLE
POPULATION
:
Canine
tissue
samples
(
stomach
,
duodenum
,
ileum
,
jejunum
,
colon
,
spleen
,
cerebral
cortex
,
lung
,
ovary
,
kidney
,
and
liver
)
were
obtained
from
2
dogs
for
northern
and
western
blot
analyses
,
and
blood
for
whole
blood
COX
assays
was
obtained
from
15
dogs
.

PROCEDURE
:
11
NSAIDs
were
evaluated
to
determine
their
COX
-
2
selectivity
in
whole
blood
assays
.

The
concentrations
of
the
drug
needed
to
inhibit
50
%
of
enzyme
activity
(
IC50
)
were
then
calculated
for
comparison
.

Expression
and
tissue
distribution
of
COX
isozymes
were
determined
by
northern
and
western
blot
analysis
.

RESULTS
:
Aspirin
,
diclofenac
,
indomethacin
,
ketoprofen
,
meclofenamic
acid
,
and
piroxicam
had
little
selectivity
toward
COX
isozymes
,
whereas
NS398
,
carprofen
,
tolfenamic
acid
,
nimesulide
,
and
etodolac
had
more
than
5
times
greater
preference
for
inhibiting
COX
-
2
than
COX
-
1
.

All
canine
tissues
examined
,
including
those
from
the
gastrointestinal
tract
,
coexpressed
COX
-
1
and
-
2
mRNA
,
although
protein
expression
was
observed
only
for
COX
-
1
.

CONCLUSIONS
AND
CLINICAL
RELEVANCE
:
Canine
COX
-
2
was
selectively
inhibited
by
etodolac
,
nimesulide
,
and
NS398
;
tolfenamic
acid
and
carprofen
also
appeared
to
be
preferential
COX
-
2
inhibitors
in
dogs
.

The
roles
of
COX
-
1
as
a
constitutive
housekeeping
enzyme
and
COX
-
2
as
a
proinflammatory
inducible
enzyme
(
as
determined
in
humans
)
appear
to
apply
to
dogs
;
therefore
,
COX
-
2
-
selective
inhibitors
should
prove
useful
in
reducing
the
adverse
effects
associated
with
nonselective
NSAIDs
.

Ketoconazole
binds
to
the
human
androgen
receptor
.

Ketoconazole
,
an
imidazole
anti
-
fungal
agent
,
has
often
produced
features
of
androgen
deficiency
including
decreased
libido
,
gynecomastia
,
impotence
,
oligospermia
,
and
decreased
testosterone
levels
,
in
men
being
treated
for
chronic
mycotic
infections
.

Based
on
these
potent
effects
on
gonadal
function
in
vivo
as
well
as
previous
work
in
vitro
demonstrating
affinity
of
ketoconazole
for
receptor
proteins
for
glucocorticoids
and
1
,
25
(
OH
)
2
vitamin
D3
and
for
sex
steroid
binding
globulin
(
SSBG
)
,
the
binding
of
ketoconazole
to
human
androgen
receptors
(
AR
)
in
vitro
was
also
examined
.

Ketoconazole
competition
with
[
3H
]
methyltrienolone
(
R1881
)
for
androgen
binding
sites
in
dispersed
,
intact
cultured
human
skin
fibroblasts
was
determined
at
22
degrees
C
.

Fifty
percent
displacement
of
[
3H
]
R1881
binding
to
AR
was
achieved
by
6
.
4
+
/
-
1
.
8
(
SE
)
x
10
(
-

)
M
ketoconazole
.

Additional
binding
studies
performed
with
ketoconazole
in
the
presence
of
increasing
amounts
of
[
3H
]
R1881
showed
that
the
interaction
of
ketoconazole
with
AR
was
competitive
when
the
data
were
analyzed
by
the
Scatchard
method
.

It
should
be
noted
,
however
,
that
the
dose
of
ketoconazole
required
for
50
%
occupancy
of
the
androgen
receptor
is
not
likely
to
be
achieved
in
vivo
,
at
least
in
plasma
.

Finally
,
androgen
binding
studies
performed
with
other
imidazoles
,
such
as
clotrimazole
,
miconazole
,
and
fluconozole
,
revealed
that
in
this
class
of
compounds
only
ketoconazole
appears
to
interact
with
the
androgen
receptor
.

Ketoconazole
appears
to
be
the
first
example
of
a
non
-
steroidal
compound
which
binds
competitively
to
both
SSBG
and
multiple
steroid
hormone
receptors
,
suggesting
that
the
ligand
binding
sites
of
these
proteins
share
some
features
in
common
.

P2
receptor
mRNA
expression
profiles
in
human
lymphocytes
,
monocytes
and
CD34
+
stem
and
progenitor
cells
.

BACKGROUND
:
Extracellular
nucleotides
(
ATP
,
ADP
,
UTP
and
UDP
)
exert
a
wide
range
of
biological
effects
in
blood
cells
mediated
by
multiple
ionotropic
P2X
receptors
and
G
protein
-
coupled
P2Y
receptors
.

Although
pharmacological
experiments
have
suggested
the
presence
of
several
P2
receptor
subtypes
on
monocytes
and
lymphocytes
,
some
results
are
contradictory
.

Few
physiological
functions
have
been
firmly
established
to
a
specific
receptor
subtype
,
partly
because
of
a
lack
of
truly
selective
agonists
and
antagonists
.

This
stimulated
us
to
investigate
the
expression
of
P2X
and
P2Y
receptors
in
human
lymphocytes
and
monocytes
with
a
newly
established
quantitative
mRNA
assay
for
P2
receptors
.

In
addition
,
we
describe
for
the
first
time
the
expression
of
P2
receptors
in
CD34
+
stem
and
progenitor
cells
implicating
a
potential
role
of
P2
receptors
in
hematopoietic
lineage
and
progenitor
/
stem
cell
function
.

RESULTS
:
Using
a
quantitative
mRNA
assay
,
we
assessed
the
hypothesis
that
there
are
specific
P2
receptor
profiles
in
inflammatory
cells
.

The
P2X4
receptor
had
the
highest
expression
in
lymphocytes
and
monocytes
.

Among
the
P2Y
receptors
,
P2Y12
and
P2Y2
had
highest
expression
in
lymphocytes
,
while
the
P2Y2
and
P2Y13
had
highest
expression
in
monocytes
.

Several
P2
receptors
were
expressed
(
P2Y2
,
P2Y1
,
P2Y12
,
P2Y13
,
P2Y11
,
P2X1
,
P2X4
)
in
CD34
+
stem
and
progenitor
cells
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
The
most
interesting
findings
were
the
high
mRNA
expression
of
P2Y12
receptors
in
lymphocytes
potentially
explaining
the
anti
-
inflammatory
effects
of
clopidogrel
,
P2Y13
receptors
in
monocytes
and
a
previously
unrecognised
expression
of
P2X4
in
lymphocytes
and
monocytes
.

In
addition
,
for
the
first
time
P2
receptor
mRNA
expression
patterns
was
studied
in
CD34
+
stem
and
progenitor
cells
.

Several
P2
receptors
were
expressed
(
P2Y2
,
P2Y1
,
P2Y12
,
P2Y13
,
P2Y11
,
P2X1
,
P2X4
)
,
indicating
a
role
in
differentiation
and
proliferation
.

Thus
,
it
is
possible
that
specific
antibodies
to
P2
receptors
could
be
used
to
identify
progenitors
for
monocytes
,
lymphocytes
and
megakaryocytes
.

Direct
multiplex
assay
of
lysosomal

in
dried
blood
spots
for
newborn
screening
.

BACKGROUND
:
Newborn
screening
for
deficiency
in
the
lysosomal
enzymes
that
cause
Fabry
,
Gaucher
,
Krabbe
,
Niemann
-
Pick
A
/
B
,
and
Pompe
diseases
is
warranted
because
treatment
for
these
syndromes
is
now
available
or
anticipated
in
the
near
feature
.

We
describe
a
multiplex
screening
method
for
all
five
lysosomal
enzymes
that
uses
newborn
-
screening
cards
containing
dried
blood
spots
as
the
enzyme
source
.

METHODS
:
We
used
a
cassette
of
substrates
and
internal
standards
to
directly
quantify

the

The

A
disorder
to
order
transition
accompanies
catalysis
in
retinaldehyde
dehydrogenase
type
II
.

Retinaldehyde
dehydrogenase
II
(
RalDH2
)
converts
retinal
to
the
transcriptional
regulator
retinoic
acid
in
the
developing
embryo
.

The
x
-
ray
structure
of
the
enzyme
revealed
an
important
structural
difference
between
this
protein
and
other
aldehyde
dehydrogenases
of
the
same
enzyme
superfamily
;
a
20
-
amino
acid
span
in
the
substrate
access
channel
in
retinaldehyde
dehydrogenase
II
is
disordered
,
whereas
in
other
aldehyde
dehydrogenases
this
region
forms
a
well
defined
wall
of
the
substrate
access
channel
.

We
asked
whether
this
disordered
loop
might
order
during
the
course
of
catalysis
and
provide
a
means
for
an
enzyme
that
requires
a
large
substrate
access
channel
to
restrict
access
to
the
catalytic
machinery
by
smaller
compounds
that
might
potentially
enter
the
active
site
and
be
metabolized
.

Our
experiments
,
a
combination
of
kinetic
,
spectroscopic
,
and
crystallographic
techniques
,
suggest
that
a
disorder
to
order
transition
is
linked
to
catalytic
activity
.

Psychopharmacology
of
anticonvulsants
:
levetiracetam
as
a
synaptic
vesicle
protein
modulator
.

ISSUE
:
A
novel
mechanism
of
action
has
recently
been
described
for
levetiracetam
,
a
member
of
a
new
class
of
anticonvulsants
.

Levetiracetam
binds
selectively
and
with
high
affinity
to
a
synaptic
vesicle
protein
known
as
SV2A
,
thought
to
be
involved
with
synaptic
vesicle
exocytosis
and
presynaptic
neurotransmitter
release
.

Terbinafine
:
mode
of
action
and
properties
of
the
squalene
epoxidase
inhibition
.

Terbinafine
(
Lamisil
)
has
primarily
fungicidal
action
against
many
fungi
as
a
result
of
its
specific
mechanism
of
squalene
epoxidase
inhibition
.

Treated
fungi
accumulate
squalene
while
becoming
deficient
in
ergosterol
,
an
essential
component
of
fungal
cell
membranes
.

The
cidal
action
is
closely
associated
with
the
development
of
high
intracellular
squalene
concentrations
,
which
are
believed
to
interfere
with
fungal
membrane
function
and
cell
wall
synthesis
.

In
the
case
of
Candida
albicans
,
growth
inhibition
with
terbinafine
appears
to
result
from
the
ergosterol
deficiency
.

The
filamentous
form
of
this
fungus
is
more
susceptible
than
the
yeast
form
.

Measurement
of
ergosterol
biosynthesis
by
incorporation
of
radiolabelled
precursors
indicates
a
correlation
between
inhibition
of
growth
and
ergosterol
biosynthesis
in
a
range
of
pathogenic
fungi
.

Terbinafine
is
a
potent
non
-
competitive
inhibitor
of
squalene
epoxidase
from
Candida
(
Ki
=
30
nM
)
.

In
contrast
,
inhibition
of
rat
liver
squalene
epoxidase
only
occurs
at
higher
drug
concentrations
(
Ki
=
77
microM
)
,
and
is
competitive
with
squalene
.

Thus
,
terbinafine
has
no
effect
on
cholesterol
biosynthesis
in
vivo
.

Squalene
epoxidase
is
not
an
enzyme
of
the
cytochrome
P
-
450
type
,
thereby
avoiding
potential
inhibition
of
this
class
of
enzymes
.

[
A
case
report
of
metastatic
pancreatic
cancer
that
responded
remarkably
to
the
combination
of
thalidomide
,
celecoxib
and
irinotecan
]
.

The
prognosis
of
pancreatic
cancer
with
metastases
or
recurrence
is
quite
poor
.

Chemotherapy
has
not
resulted
in
a
significant
survival
benefit
;
median
survival
is
3
-
6
months
.

Various
chemotherapeutic
agents
have
been
evaluated
and
the
standard
chemotherapy
of
pancreatic
cancer
is
gemcitabine
.

The
response
rate
,
however
,
is
low
at
13
%
.

Thalidomide
and
celecoxib
have
different
mechanisms
of
action
and
activity
in
various
malignant
tumors
.

Both
have
been
evaluated
and
shown
to
demonstrate
activity
against
solid
tumors
.

Thalidomide
decreased
the
stability
of
TNF
-
mRNA
and
COX
-
2
mRNA
.

COX
-
2
is
a
bifunctional
enzyme
possessing
both
cyclooxygenase
and
peroxidase
activities
.

Although
celecoxib
inhibits
PG
biosynthesis
,
most
do
not
affect
the
peroxidase
activity
of
COX
,
which
can
generate
proximate
carcinogens
.

Because
thalidomide
does
not
completely
inhibit
COX
-
2
expression
or
PG
biosynthesis
,
a
therapeutic
strategy
combining
celecoxib
with
thalidomide
might
be
more
effective
than
using
either
agent
alone
.

Differences
in
the
mechanism
of
action
of
gemcitabine
and
irinotecan
suggest
that
a
change
of
gemcitabine
to
irinotecan
could
provide
clinically
efficacious
outcomes
.

In
order
to
accomplish
new
treatment
strategies
,
we
have
been
using
thalidomide
,
celecoxib
and
irinotecan
in
low
-
doses
.

We
believe
this
combination
represents
a
viable
treatment
for
patients
of
pancreatic
cancer
with
recurrence
or
metastases
.

Effect
of
pitavastatin
on
apolipoprotein
A
-
I
production
in
HepG2
cell
.

There
are
few
reports
describing
the
mechanism
of
HDL
-
elevating
action
of
HMG
-
CoA
reductase
inhibitors
(
statins
)
.

As
it
is
considered
that
the
key
step
of
HDL
production
is
the
secretion
of
apolipoprotein
A
-
I
(
apoA
-
I
)
,
we
investigated
the
effect
of
statins
on
apoA
-
I
synthesis
and
secretion
by
HepG2
cell
to
elucidate
the
mechanism
of
the
action
.

Each
statin
induced
apoA
-
I
expression
(
mRNA
and
protein
)
dose
-
dependently
:
the
rank
order
of
the
apoA
-
I
induction
pitavastatin
(
3
microM
)
>
simvastatin
(
10
microM
)
>
atorvastatin
(
30
microM
)
.

The
induction
of
apoA
-
I
by
statins
disappeared
with
addition
of
mevalonate
,
which
indicates
that
the
effect
is
HMG
-
CoA
reductase
inhibition
-
dependent
.

Based
on
HMG
-
CoA
reductase
inhibition
,
pitavastatin
-
induced
apoA
-
I
more
efficiently
than
simvastatin
and
atorvastatin
.

Further
study
revealed
that
pitavastatin
increased
ABCA1
mRNA
in
HMG
-
CoA
reductase
-
dependent
manner
and
that
Rho
and
Rho
kinase
inhibitor
(
C3T
and
Y27632
)
increased
apoA
-
I
production
in
the
HepG2
cells
.

These
results
suggest
that
pitavastatin
efficiently
increases
apoA
-
I
in
the
culture
medium
of
HepG2
cells
by
promoting
apoA
-
I
production
through
inhibition
of
HMG
-
CoA
reductase
and
suppression
of
Rho
activity
and
by
protecting
apoA
-
I
from
catabolism
through
ABCA1
induction
and
lipidation
of
apoA
-
I
.

"
regimen
is
antiangiogenic
,
producing
objective
responses
and
survival
benefit
in
a
mouse
model
of
cancer
.

PURPOSE
:
A
transgenic
mouse
model
has
revealed
parameters
of
the
angiogenic
switch
during
multistep
tumorigenesis
of
pancreatic
islets
,
and
demonstrated
efficacy
of
antiangiogenic
therapies
.

Pericytes
have
been
revealed
as
functionally
important
for
tumor
neovasculature
,
using
kinase
inhibitors
targeting
their
platelet
-
derived
growth
factor
receptors
(
PDGFRs
)
.

Additionally
,
vascular
endothelial
growth
factor
receptor
(
VEGFR
)
inhibitors
and
metronomic
chemotherapy
show
modest
benefit
against
early
-
but
not
late
-
stage
disease
.

MATERIALS
AND
METHODS
:
Seeking
to
improve
efficacy
against
otherwise
intractable
end
-
stage
pancreatic
islet
tumors
,
two
receptor
tyrosine
kinase
inhibitors
,
imatinib
and
SU11248
,
were
used
to
disrupt
PDGFR
-
mediated
pericyte
support
of
tumor
endothelial
cells
in
concert
with
maximum
-
tolerated
dose
(
MTD
)
or
metronomic
chemotherapy
and
/
or
VEGFR
inhibition
.

RESULTS
:
Imatinib
,
despite
equivocal
efficacy
as
monotherapy
,
reduced
pericyte
coverage
of
tumor
vessels
and
enhanced
efficacy
in
combination
with
metronomic
chemotherapy
or
VEGFR
inhibition
.

A
regimen
involving
all
three
was
even
better
.

MTD
using
cyclophosphamide
caused
transitory
regression
,
but
then
rapid
regrowth
,
in
contrast
to
metronomic
cyclophosphamide
plus
imatinib
,
which
produced
stable
disease
.

The
MTD
regimen
elicited
apoptosis
of
tumor
cells
but
not
endothelial
cells
,
whereas
the
other
regimens
increased
endothelial
cell
apoptosis
concordant
with
efficacy
.

A
"
chemo
-
switch
"
protocol
,
involving
sequential
MTD
and
then
metronomic
chemotherapy
,
overlaid
with
multitargeted
inhibition
of
PDGFR
and
VEGFR
,
gave
complete
responses
and
unprecedented
survival
advantage
in
this
model
.

CONCLUSION
:
This
study
demonstrates
a
potentially
tractable
clinical
strategy
in
a
stringent
preclinical
model
,
wherein
standard
-
of
-
care
chemotherapy
is
followed
by
a
novel
maintenance
regimen
:
PDFGR
is
targeted
to
disrupt
pericyte
support
,
while
metronomic
chemotherapy
and
/
or
VEGFR
inhibitors
target
consequently
sensitized
endothelial
cells
,
collectively
destabilizing
pre
-
existing
tumor
vasculature
and
inhibiting
ongoing
angiogenesis

Preferential
and
non
-
selective
cyclooxygenase
inhibitors
reduce
inflammation
during
lipopolysaccharide
-
induced
synovitis
.

Synovitis
in
horses
is
frequently
treated
by
administration
of
non
-
steroidal
anti
-
inflammatory
drugs
(
NSAIDs
)
,
which
inhibit
cyclooxygenase
isoforms
(
COX
-
1
and
COX
-
2
)
.

Constitutively
expressed
COX
-
1
is
involved
in
physiologic
functions
such
as
maintenance
of
gastric
mucosal
integrity
,
whereas
COX
-
2
is
up
-
regulated
at
sites
of
inflammation
.

Thus
,
COX
-
2
inhibitors
reduce
inflammation
with
reduced
gastrointestinal
side
effects
as
compared
to
non
-
selective
COX
inhibitors
.

The
objective
of
the
present
study
was
to
compare
the
anti
-
inflammatory
effects
of
the
preferential
COX
-
2
inhibitor
etodolac
with
the
non
-
selective
COX
inhibitor
phenylbutazone
in
horses
with
lipopolysaccharide
(
LPS
)
-
induced
synovitis
.

Three
groups
of
horses
(
n
=
6
)
received
no
treatment
,
phenylbutazone
(
4
.
4
mg
/
kg
,
IV
,
q12h
)
,
or
etodolac
(
23
mg
/
kg
,
IV
,
q12h
)
,
respectively
,
2
-
h
following
injection
of
LPS
into
one
middle
carpal
joint
.

Synovial
fluid
was
analyzed
for
white
blood
cell
(
WBC
)
count
,
and
TXB2
and
PGE2
levels
.

Phenylbutazone
and
etodolac
significantly
reduced
WBC
count
6
and
24
-
h
following
injection
of
LPS
compared
to
untreated
horses
.

In
addition
,
both
drugs
significantly
reduced
PGE2
levels
(
P
<
0
.
05
)
6
-
h
following
LPS
injection
,
whereas
the
probable
COX
-
1
prostanoid
TXB2
was
significantly
reduced
by
phenylbutazone
(
P
<
0
.
05
)
,
but
not
etodolac
.

Etodolac
may
serve
as
a
more
selective
anti
-
inflammatory
agent
than
phenylbutazone
for
treatment
of
equine
synovitis
.

Genetic
polymorphisms
predisposing
to
hyperhomocysteinemia
in
cardiac
transplant
patients
.

Genetic
determinants
for
high
homocysteine
(
Hcy
)
levels
are
now
well
known
.

We
studied
several
single
nucleotide
polymorphisms
(
SNP
)
in
Hcy
-
regulating
genes
[
methylenetetrahydrofolate
reductase
(
MTHFR
)
C677T

A1298C
;
methionine

(
MS
)
A2756G
;
methionine

(

)
A66G
]
in
relation
to
total
plasma
Hcy
levels
,
transplant
coronary
artery
disease
and
thromboembolic
episodes
in
84
heart
transplant
patients
,
and
we
compared
the
incidence
of
these
polymorphisms
with
those
in
a
healthy
adult
controls
.

At
least
one
copy
of
the
G
allele
of
the
MTRR
A66G
SNP
was
found
in
a
significantly
greater
proportion
of
cardiac
transplant
(
CTX
)
recipients
compared
with
controls
(
94
.
0

%
respectively
)
.

None
of
the
SNP
analyzed
were
correlated
with
total
Hcy
plasma
levels
or
the
presence
of
transplant
coronary
artery
disease
.

However
,
MS

In

there

Differences
in

were
noted
.

Thus
,

be
important
determinants
of

in

raising
the

Effect
of
bosentan
(
ETA
/
ETB
receptor
antagonist
)
on
metabolic
changes
during
stress
and
diabetes
.

Elevated
plasma
ET
-
1
levels
have
been
reported
in
several
conditions
such
as
stress
and
diabetes
.

ET
-
1
is
found
to
cause
insulin
resistance
and
to
stimulate
liver
glycogenolysis
.

The
question
arises
whether
ET
-
1
has
a
role
in
the
metabolic
changes
occurring
in
such
conditions
.

To
test
this
,
we
studied
the
possible
effect
of
the
endothelin
receptor
antagonist
,
bosentan
(
50
and
100
mg
kg
(
-

)
)
on
serum
glucose
and
insulin
levels
as
well
as
on
liver
glycogen
contents
in
normoglycemic
stressed
animals
.

In
addition
,
the
effect
of
bosentan
on
serum
glucose
and
insulin
levels
in
both
mild
and
severely
diabetic
rats
and
its
effect
on
insulin
-
induced
hypoglycemia
were
also
determined
.

Restraining
water
immersion
stress
was
used
as
a
model
for
severe
stress
reported
to
elevate
plasma
ET
-
1
level
.

Mild
diabetes
was
induced
in
rats
by
intraperitoneal
injection
of
a
low
dose
of
streptozotocin
(
38
mg
kg
(
-
1
)
)
while
severe
diabetes
was
induced
by
intraperitoneal
injection
of
a
higher
dose
of
streptozotocin
(
45
mg
kg
(
-
1
)
)
.

Bosentan
partially
prevented
stress
-
induced
both
hyperglycemia
and
decrease
in
glycogen
content
while
it
completely
blocked
the
stress
-
induced
decrease
in
insulin
level
in
normoglycemic
stressed
rats
.

Bosentan
also
decreased
serum
glucose
level
without
any
effect
on
insulin
secretion
in
mild
diabetic
rats
and
potentiated
the
hypoglycemic
action
of
insulin
.

Minocycline
has
anti

effects
on
cartilage
,

and
periodontal
tissues
,
and
both
properties
are
central
to
the

.

We
investigated
the
effects
of

hepatitis
in
C57BL

mice
induced
by
lethal
challenge
of

resisted
this

minocycline
efficiently
suppressed
the

suggest
that
easing

may
involve
a

Role
of
hydrogen
sulfide
in
acute
pancreatitis
and
associated
lung
injury
.

Hydrogen
sulfide
(
H2S
)
is
a
naturally
occurring
gas
with
potent
vasodilator
activity
.

Cystathionine
-
gamma
-
lyase
(
CSE
)
and
cystathionine
-
beta
-
synthase
(
CBS
)
utilize
L
-
cysteine
as
substrate
to
form
H2S
.

Of
these
two
enzymes
,
cystathionine
-
gamma
-
lyase
(
CSE
)
is
believed
to
be
the
key
enzyme
that
forms
H2S
in
the
cardiovascular
system
.

Whilst
H2S
has
been
reported
to
relax
precontracted
rat
arteries
in

and
to
lower
blood
pressure
in
the
rat
,
its

Atypical
and
typical
antipsychotic
drug
interactions
with
the
dopamine
D2
receptor
.

A
model
of
the
dopamine
D2
receptor
was
used
to
study
the
receptor
interactions
of
dopamine
,
the
typical
antipsychotics
haloperidol
and
loxapine
,
and
the
atypical
antipsychotics
clozapine
and
melperone
.

The
atypical
antipsychotics
interacted
with
the
halogen
atom
of
the
ring
system
in
the
direction
of
the
transmembrane
helices
(
TMHs
)
2
,
3
and
7
,
while
the
typical
had
the
corresponding
halogen
atom
in
the
direction
of
TMH5
.

Molecular
dynamics
simulations
indicated
that
the
average
helical
displacement
upon
binding
increased
in
the
order
:
typical
<
atypical
<
dopamine
.

Upon
binding
,
the
atypical
induced
larger
displacements
into
TMH5
than
did
the
typical
.

The
typical
had
stronger
non
-
bonded
interactions
with
the
receptor
than
had
the
atypical
,
which
is
in
agreement
with
the
experimental
observation
that
the
atypical
antipsychotic
drugs
dissociate
faster
from
the
receptor
than
the
typical
antipsychotic
drugs
.

processes

The
identification
of
defective
structures
in
the
ABCG5
or
ABCG8
transporters
in
patients
with
the
rare
disease
of
sitosterolemia
elucidated
their
role
as
sterol
efflux
pumps
regulating
at
least
in
parts
the
intestinal
sterol
absorption
and
the
hepatic
sterol
output
.

ABCG5
and
ABCG8
themselves
are
regulated
by
cholesterol
via
liver
X
receptors
(
LXRs
)
,
which
are
also
activated
by
oxysterols
and
some
derivatives
of
plant
sterols
.

NPC1L1
could
recently
be
identified
as
a
major
sterol
transporter
for
the
intestinal
uptake
of
cholesterol
as
well
as
plant
sterols
.

Studies
in
NPC1L1
knockout
mice
indicate
that
this
transporter
is
essential
for
the
intestinal
uptake
of
sterols
and
that
NPC1L1
might
also
be
involved
in
the
mechanism
of
action
of
ezetimibe
.

However
,
studies
with
photoreactive
cholesterol
as
well
as
with
photoreactive
ezetimibe
analogues
suggest
that
other
processes
might
also
be
involved
in
the
mechanism
of
action
of
ezetimibe
.

upregulated
both

To
determine
whether
this

could
be
recapitulated
in

,
we
treated
14
patients
with

with
escalating
doses
of
bexarotene
(
75

and
denileukin

in

.

Modulation

Our

demonstrate
that
the

is
well
tolerated
and
that
even
low

capable

Crystal

Prostate
-
specific
membrane
antigen
(
PSMA
)
is
highly
expressed
in
prostate
cancer
cells
and
nonprostatic
solid
tumor
neovasculature
and
is
a
target
for
anticancer
imaging
and
therapeutic
agents
.

PSMA
acts
as
a
glutamate
carboxypeptidase
(
GCPII
)
on
small
molecule
substrates
,
including
folate
,
the
anticancer
drug
methotrexate
,
and
the
neuropeptide

Here
we
present
the

-
A
crystal
structure
of
the
PSMA
ectodomain
,
which
reveals
a
homodimer
with
structural
similarity
to
transferrin
receptor
,
a
receptor
for
iron
-
loaded
transferrin
that
lacks
protease
activity
.

Unlike
transferrin
receptor
,
the
protease
domain
of
PSMA
contains
a
binuclear
zinc
site
,
catalytic
residues
,
and
a
proposed
substrate
-
binding
arginine
patch
.

Elucidation
of
the
PSMA
structure
combined
with
docking
studies
and
a
proposed
catalytic

provides
insight
into
the
recognition
of
inhibitors
and
the
natural
substrate
N

The
PSMA

will
facilitate

Conversion
of
5
-
aminolevulinate
synthase
into
a
more
active
enzyme
by
linking
the
two
subunits
:
spectroscopic
and
kinetic
properties
.

The
two
active
sites
of
dimeric
5
-
aminolevulinate
synthase
(
ALAS
)
,
a
pyridoxal
5
'
-
phosphate
(
PLP
)
-
dependent
enzyme
,
are
located
on
the
subunit
interface
with
contribution
of
essential
amino
acids
from
each
subunit
.

Linking
the
two
subunits
into
a
single
polypeptide
chain
dimer
(
2XALAS
)
yielded
an
enzyme
with
an
approximate
sevenfold
greater
turnover
number
than
that
of
wild
-
type
ALAS
.

Spectroscopic
and
kinetic
properties
of
2XALAS
were
investigated
to
explore
the
differences
in
the
coenzyme
structure
and
kinetic
mechanism
relative
to
those
of
wild
-
type
ALAS
that
confer
a
more
active
enzyme
.

The
absorption
spectra
of
both
ALAS
and
2XALAS
had
maxima
at
410
and
330
nm
,
with
a
greater
A
(
410
)
/
A
(
330
)
ratio
at
pH
approximately
7
.
5
for
2XALAS
.

The
330
nm
absorption
band
showed
an
intense
fluorescence
at
385
nm
but
not
at
510
nm
,
indicating
that
the
330
nm
absorption
species
is
the
substituted
aldamine
rather
than
the
enolimine
form
of
the
Schiff
base
.

The
385
nm
emission
intensity
increased
with
increasing
pH
with
a
single
pK
of
approximately
8
.
5
for
both
enzymes
,
and
thus
the
410
and
330
nm
absorption
species
were
attributed
to
the
ketoenamine
and
substituted
aldamine
,
respectively
.

Transient
kinetic
analysis
of
the
formation
and
decay
of
the
quinonoid
intermediate
EQ
(
2
)
indicated
that
,
although
their
rates
were
similar
in
ALAS
and
2XALAS
,
accumulation
of
this
intermediate
was
greater
in
the
2XALAS
-
catalyzed
reaction
.

Collectively
,
these
results
suggest
that
ketoenamine
is
the
active
form
of
the
coenzyme
and
forms
a
more
prominent
coenzyme
structure
in
2XALAS
than
in
ALAS
at
pH
approximately
7
.

.

Regulation
of
the
expression
of
peptidylarginine
deiminase
type
II
gene
(
PADI2
)
in
human
keratinocytes
involves
Sp1
and
Sp3
transcription
factors
.

Peptidylarginine
deiminases
(
PAD
)
convert
protein
-
bound
arginine
residues
into
citrulline
residues
in
a
Ca
(
2

)
ion
-
dependent
manner
.

Among
the
five
isoforms
(
PAD1
,
2
,
3
,
4
,
and
6
)
existing
in
rodents
and
humans
,
PAD2
is
the
most
widely
expressed
in
both
species
,
tissues
,
and
organs
.

In
order
to
study
the
mechanisms
regulating
the
expression
of
the
human
PAD2
gene
,
PADI2
,
we
characterized
its
promoter
region
using
transfected
human
keratinocytes
.

A
series
of
reporter
gene
constructions
derived
from
the
2
kb
region
upstream
of
the
transcription
initiation
site
defined
a
minimal
promoter
sequence
from
nucleotides
-
132
to
-
41
.

This
PADI2
region
is
GC
-
rich
and
lacks
canonical
TATA
and
CAAT
boxes
.

Investigation
of
cis
-
acting
elements
in
the
region
,
further
deletion
analyses
and
electrophoretic
mobility
shift
assays
using
specific
antibodies
revealed
four
Sp1
-
binding
sites
and
identified
Sp1
and
Sp3
as
binding
factors
important
for
the
promoter
activity
.

These
results
suggest
that
Sp1
/
Sp3
cooperation
may
provide
a
mechanism
to
control
the
transcription
of
PADI2
.

Activator
of
G
protein
signaling
3
regulates
opiate
activation
of
protein
kinase
A
signaling
and
relapse
of
heroin
-
seeking
behavior
.

The
nucleus
accumbens
(
NAc
)
is
central
to
heroin
addiction
.

Activation
of
opiate
receptors
in
the
NAc
dissociates
G
(
i
/
o
)
into
alpha
and
betagamma
subunits
.

Galpha
(
i
)
inhibits
cAMP
production
,
but
betagamma
regulates
several
molecular
pathways
,
including
protein
kinase
A
(
PKA
)
.

We
show
in
NAc
/
striatal
neurons
that
opiates
paradoxically
activate
PKA
signaling
by
means
of
betagamma
dimers
.

Activation
requires
Galpha
(
i3
)
and
an
activator
of
G
protein
signaling
3
(
AGS3
)
.

AGS3
competes
with
betagamma
for
binding
to
Galpha
(
i3
)
-
GDP
and
enhances
the
action
of
unbound
betagamma
.

AGS3
and
Galpha
(
i3
)
knockdown
prevents
opiate
activation
of
PKA
signaling
.

In
rats
self
-
administering
heroin
,
AGS3
antisense
in
the
NAc
core
,
but
not
shell
,
eliminates
reinstatement
of
heroin
-
seeking
behavior
,
a
model
of
human
relapse
.

Thus
,
Galpha
(
i3
)
/
betagamma
/
AGS3
appears
to
mediate
mu
opiate
receptor
activation
of
PKA
signaling
as
well
as
heroin
-
seeking
behavior
.

Review
article
:
5
-
hydroxytryptamine
agonists
and
antagonists
in
the
modulation
of
gastrointestinal
motility
and
sensation
:
clinical
implications
.

Serotonin
(
5
-
hydroxytryptamine
;
5
-
HT
)
is
found
in
the
enteric
nervous
system
where
it
has
been
implicated
in
controlling
gastrointestinal
motor
function
.

A
number
of
receptor
or
recognition
sites
have
been
identified
in
the
gut
,
but
recently
most
attention
has
focused
on
the
5
-
HT3
and
5
-
HT4
receptors
.

The
functional
role
of
the
5
-
HT3
receptor
remains
incompletely
understood
,
but
it
is
probably
involved
in
the
modulation
of
colonic
motility
and
visceral
pain
in
the
gut
.

A
number
of
selective
5
-
HT3
antagonists
have
been
developed
including
ondansetron
,
granisetron
,
tropisetron
renzapride
and
zacopride
.

While
the
substituted
benzamide
prokinetics
(
for
example
,
metoclopramide
,
cisapride
)
also
block
5
-
HT3
receptors
in
high
concentrations
,
their
prokinetic
action
is
believed
to
be
on
the
basis
of
their
agonist
effects
on
the
putative
5
-
HT4
receptor
.

Some
5
-
HT3
antagonists
have
5
-
HT4
agonist
activity
(
for
example
,
renzapride
,
zacopride
)
and
others
do
not
(
for
example
,
ondansetron
,
granisetron
)
,
while
tropisetron
in
high
concentrations
is
a
5
-
HT4
antagonist
.

Based
on
the
pharmacological
data
,
it
has
been
suggested
that
specific
5
-
HT
antagonists
and
agonists
may
prove
to
be
beneficial
in
a
number
of
gastrointestinal
disorders
including
the
irritable
bowel
syndrome
,
functional
dyspepsia
,
non
-
cardiac
chest
pain
,
gastrooesophageal
reflux
and
refractory
nausea
.

In
this
review
,
the
rationale
for
the
use
of
these
compounds
is
discussed
,
and
the
available
experimental
evidence
is
summarized
.

Niacin
mediates
lipolysis
in
adipose
tissue
through
its
G
-
protein
coupled
receptor
HM74A
.

A
G
-
protein
coupled
receptor
to
niacin
(
nicotinic
acid
)
was
identified
recently
but
the
physiological
/
pharmacological
role
of
the
receptor
remains
poorly
defined
.

We
present
our
studies
to
demonstrate
that
HM74A
,
but
not
HM74
,
binds
niacin
at
high
affinities
and
effectively
mediates
Gi
signaling
events
in
human
embryonic
kidney
HEK293
cells
as
well
as
in
3T3L1
adipocytes
expressing
HM74A
.

Furthermore
,
HM74A
,
but
not
HM74
,
expressed
in
differentiated
3T3L1
adipocytes
effectively
mediated
inhibition
of
lipolysis
by
niacin
.

Our
results
provided
direct
evidence
indicating
that
HM74A
,
but
not
HM74
,
was
sufficient
to
mediate
anti
-
lipolytic
effect
of
niacin
in
adipose
tissue
.

Effect
of
gene
disruptions
of
the
TCA
cycle
on
production
of
succinic
acid
in
Saccharomyces

.

Succinate
is
the
main
taste
component
produced
by
yeasts
during
sake
(

fermentation
.

The
pathway
leading
to
accumulation
of
succinate
was
examined
in
liquid
culture
in
the
presence
of
a
high

(
15

of
glucose
under
aerobic

using
a

of
Saccharomyces

strains
in
which
various

that
encode
the

were
disrupted
.

When

)
gene
disrupted
mutant
produced
a
lower
level
of
succinate
than
the
wild
-
type
strain
,
while
the
SDH1
(
succinate
dehydrogenase
)
gene
-
disrupted
mutant
produced
an
increased
level
of
succinate
.

On
the
other
hand
,
the
FUM1
(
fumarase
)
gene
disrupted
mutant
produced
significantly
higher
levels
of
fumarate
but
did
not
form
malate
at
all
.

These
results
indicate
that
succinate
,
fumarate
and
malate
are
mainly
synthesized
through
the
TCA
cycle
(
oxidative
direction
)
even
in
the
presence
of
glucose
at
a
concentration
as
high
as
15
%
.

When
the
growth
condition
was
shifted
from
aerobic
to
anaerobic
,
the
increased
level
of
succinate
in
SDH1
disruptants
was
no
longer
observed
,
whereas
the
decreased
level
of
succinate
in
the
KGD1
diruptant
was
still
observed
.

A
double
mutant
of
the
two
fumarate
reductase
isozyme
genes
(
OSM1
and
FRDS
)
showed
a
succinate
productivity
of
50
%
as
compared
to
the
parent
when
cells
were
incubated
in
glucose
-
buffered
solution
.

These
results
indicate
that
succinate
could
be
synthesized
through
two
pathways
,
namely
,
alpha
-
ketoglutarate
oxidation
via
the
TCA
cycle
and
fumarate
reduction
under
anaerobic
conditions
.

The
unexpected

of

drugs
.

Conventional
nonselective
NSAIDs
are
classically
associated
with
a
risk
of
gastrointestinal

.

These
drugs
have
a
broad
range
of
relative
selectivity
towards
the
COX
family
,
mainly
towards
two
isoforms
of
these
enzymes
:
COX
-
1
and
-
2
.

As
examples
,
ketorolac
,
flurbiprofen
,
ketoprofen
and
indomethacin
have
increased
COX
-
1
selectivity
when
compared
with
naproxen
and
ibuprofen
.

The
objective
was
to
evaluate
the

The

of

,
such
as

(

.

To
do
this
we

compared
the

the

was
shown
to
be
a
high

A
novel
function
of
differentiation
revealed
by
cDNA
microarray
profiling
of
p75NTR
-
regulated
gene
expression
.

The
expression
of
the
p75
neurotrophin
receptor
(
p75NTR
)
is
diminished
in
epithelial
cells
during
progression
of
prostate
cancer
in
vivo
and
in
vitro
.

Previous
studies
have
demonstrated
a
role
for
p75NTR
as
a
tumor
suppressor
in
prostate
growth
.

To
better
understand
the
molecular
mechanism
of
p75
(
NTR
)
on
tumor
suppression
,
we
utilized
a
complementary
deoxyribonucleic
acid
microarray
composed
of
approximately
6
,
000
human
cancer
-
related
genes
to
determine
the
gene
expression
pattern
altered
by
re
-
introduction
of
p75NTR
into
PC
-
3
prostate
tumor
cells
.

Comparison
of
the
transcripts
in
the
neo
and
p75NTR
-
transfected
cells
revealed
52
differentially
expressed
genes
,
of
which
21
were
up
-
regulated
and
31
were
down
-
regulated
in
the
presence
of
p75NTR
.

Based
on
the
known
biological
functions
of
the
p75NTR
-
regulated
genes
,
we
observed
that
p75NTR
modulated
the
expression
of
genes
that
are
critically
involved
in
the
regulation
of
differentiation
as
well
as
cell
adhesion
,
signal
transduction
,
apoptosis
,
tumor
cell
invasion
,
and
metastasis
.

Several
differentially
expressed
genes
identified
by
microarray
were
selected
for
confirmation
using
quantitative
real
-
time
polymerase
chain
reaction
.

Immunoblot
analysis
further
confirmed
increased
cellular
retinoic
acid
-
binding
protein
I
(
CRABPI
)
and
IGFBP5
protein
levels
and
decreased
level
of
PLAUR
protein
with
increasing
p75NTR
protein
expression
.

As
CRABPI
was
elevated
far
more
than
any
other
genes
,
we
observed
that
the
retinoids
,
all
-
trans
retinoic
acid
and
9
-
cis
retinoic
acid
,
that
bind
CRABPI
,
promoted
nitroblue
tetrazolium
-
associated
functional
cell
differentiation
in
p75NTR
PC
-
3
cells
,
but
not
in
neo
control
PC
-
3
cells
.

Subsequent
examination
of
the
retinoic
acid
receptors
(
RARs
)
expression
levels
demonstrated
an
absence
of
RAR
-
beta
in
the
neo
control
cells
and
re
-
expression
in
the
p75NTR
expressing
cells
,
consistent
with
previous
findings
where
RAR
-
beta
is
believed
to
play
a
critical
role
as
a
tumor
suppressor
gene
that
is
lost
during
de
-
differentiation
of
prostate
epithelial
cells
.

Whereas
the
RAR
-
alpha
and
-
gamma
protein
levels
remained
unchanged
,
retinoid
X
receptor
(
RXR
)
-
alpha
and
-
beta
also
exhibited
increasing
protein
levels
with
re
-
expression
of
the
p75NTR
protein
.

Moreover
,
the
ability
of
p75NTR
siRNA
to
knockdown
levels
of
RAR
-
beta
,
RXR
-
alpha
,
and
RXR
-
beta
supports
the
specificity
of
the
functional
involvement
of
p75NTR
in
differentiation
.

Hence
,
re
-
expression
of
the
p75NTR
appears
to
partially
reverse
de
-
differentiation
of
prostate
cancer
cells
by
up
-
regulating
the
expression
of
CRABPI
for
localized
sequestration
of
retinoids
that
are
available
to
newly
up
-
regulated
RAR
-
beta
,
RXR
-
alpha
,
and
RXR

GPR109A
(
PUMA
-
G
/
HM74A
)
mediates
nicotinic
acid
-
induced
flushing
.

Nicotinic
acid
(
niacin
)
has
long
been
used
as
an
antidyslipidemic
drug
.

Its
special
profile
of
actions
,
especially
the
rise
in
HDL
-
cholesterol
levels
induced
by
nicotinic
acid
,
is
unique
among
the
currently
available
pharmacological
tools
to
treat
lipid
disorders
.

Recently
,
a
G
-
protein
-
coupled
receptor
,
termed
GPR109A
(
HM74A
in
humans
,
PUMA
-
G
in
mice
)
,
was
described
and
shown
to
mediate
the
nicotinic
acid
-
induced
antilipolytic
effects
in
adipocytes
.

One
of
the
major
problems
of
the
pharmacotherapeutical
use
of
nicotinic
acid
is
a
strong
flushing
response
.

This
side
effect
,
although
harmless
,
strongly
affects
patient
compliance
.

In
the
present
study
,
we
show
that
mice
lacking
PUMA
-
G
did
not
show
nicotinic
acid
-
induced
flushing
.

In
addition
,
flushing
in
response
to
nicotinic
acid
was
also
abrogated
in
the
absence
of
cyclooxygenase
type
1
,
and
mice
lacking
prostaglandin
D
(
2
)
(
PGD
(
2
)
)
and
prostaglandin
E
(
2
)
(
PGE
(
2
)
)
receptors
had
reduced
flushing
responses
.

The
mouse
orthologue
of
GPR109A
,
PUMA
-
G
,
is
highly
expressed
in
macrophages
and
other
immune
cells
,
and
transplantation
of
wild
-
type
bone
marrow
into
irradiated
PUMA
-
G
-
deficient
mice
restored
the
nicotinic
acid
-
induced
flushing
response
.

Our
data
clearly
indicate
that
GPR109A
mediates
nicotinic
acid
-
induced
flushing
and
that
this
effect
involves
release
of
PGE
(
2
)
and
PGD
(
2
)
,
most
likely
from
immune
cells
of
the
skin
.

The
Arg389Gly
beta1
-
adrenoceptor
polymorphism
and
catecholamine
effects
on
plasma

activity
.

OBJECTIVES
:
The
purpose
of
this
research
was
to
find
out
whether
,
in
humans
,
dobutamine
-
induced
hemodynamic
effects
and
increase
in
plasma
-
renin
activity
(
PRA
)
might
be
beta1
-
adrenoceptor
(
beta1AR
)
genotype
-
dependent
.

BACKGROUND
:
In
vitro
Arg389Gly
-
beta1AR
polymorphism
exhibits
decreased
receptor
signaling
.

METHODS
:
We
studied
10
male
homozygous
Arg389
-
beta1AR
subjects
and
8
male
homozygous
Gly389beta1AR
subjects
;
to
avoid
influences
of
codon
49
polymorphism
,
all
were
homozygous
Ser49
-
beta1AR
.

Subjects
were
infused
with
dobutamine
(
1
to
6
microg
/
kg
/
min
)
with
or
without
bisoprolol
(
10
mg
orally
)
pretreatment
,
and
PRA
,
heart
rate
,
contractility
,
and
blood
pressure
were
assessed
.

RESULTS
:
With
regard
to
PRA
,
dobutamine
increased
PRA
more
potently
in
Arg389
-
beta1AR
versus
Gly389
-
beta1AR
subjects
.

Bisoprolol
markedly
suppressed
the
dobutamine
-
induced
PRA
increase
in
Arg389
-
but
only
marginally
in
Gly389
-
beta1AR
subjects
.

With
regard
to
hemodynamics
,
dobutamine
caused
larger
heart
rate
and
contractility
increases
and
diastolic
blood
pressure
decreases
in
Arg389
-
versus
Gly389
-
beta1AR
subjects
.

Bisoprolol
reduced
dobutamine
-
induced
heart
rate
and
contractility
increases
and
diastolic
blood
pressure
decreases
more
potently
in
Arg389
-
versus
Gly389
-
beta1AR
subjects
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
Codon
389
beta1AR
polymorphism
is
a
determinant
not
only
of
hemodynamic
effects
but
also
of
PRA
.

Thus
,
beta1AR
polymorphisms
may
be
useful
for
predicting
therapeutic
responses
to
betaAR

blocker
treatment
.

,
in
brain
phospholipids
by
decreasing
the
activity
of
an
arachidonic
acid
-
selective
phospholipase
A
(
2
)
.

Although
chronic
valproic
acid
produces
similar
effects
on
brain
arachidonic
acid
and
docosahexaenoic
acid
turnover
,
it
does
not
alter
phospholipase
A
(
2
)
activity
,
suggesting
that
it
targets
a
different
enzyme
in
the
turnover
pathway
.

MATERIALS
AND
METHODS
/
RESULTS
:
By
isolating
rat
brain
microsomal
long
-
chain
fatty
acyl
-
CoA
synthetases
(
Acsl
)
,
we
show
in
vitro
that
valproic
acid
is
a
non
-
competitive
inhibitor
of
Acsl
,
as
it
reduces
the
maximal
velocity
of
the
reaction
without
changing
the
affinity
of
the
substrate
for
the
enzyme
.

While
valproic
acid
inhibited
the
synthesis
of
arachidonoyl
-
CoA
,
palmitoyl
-
CoA
,
and
docosahexaenoyl
-
CoA
,
the
K
(
i
)
for
inhibition
of
arachidonoyl
-
CoA
synthesis
(
14
.
1
mM
)
was
approximately
one
fifth
the
K
(
i
)
for
inhibiting
palmitoyl

CoA
(
85
.
4
mM
)
and
docosahexaenoyl
-
CoA
(
78
.
2
mM
)
synthesis
.

As
chronic
administration
of
valproic
acid
in
bipolar
disorder
achieves
whole
-
brain
levels
of
1
.
0
to
1
.
5
mM
,
inhibition
of
arachidonoyl
-
CoA
formation
can
occur
at
brain
concentrations
that
are
therapeutically
relevant
to
this
disease
.

Furthermore
,
brain
microsomal
Acsl
did
not
produce
valproyl
-
CoA
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
This
study
shows
that
valproic
acid
acts
as
a
non
-
competitive
inhibitor
of
brain
microsomal
Acsl
,
and
that
inhibition
is
substrate
-
selective
.

The
study
supports
the
hypothesis
that
valproic
acid
acts
in
bipolar
disorder
by
reducing
the
brain
arachidonic
acid
cascade
,
by
inhibiting
arachidonoyl
-
CoA
formation
.

From
an
inborn
error
patient
to
a
search
for
regulatory
meaning
:
a
biotin
conducted
voyage
.

This
article
summarizes
some
findings
of
a
research
that
I
have
pursued
for
the
past
25
years
,
whose
roots
are
immersed
in
the
field
of
inherited
metabolic
disorders
,
and
deal
with
different
aspects
of
the
vitamin
biotin
,
starting
with
a
patient
with
multiple
carboxylase
deficiency
(
MCD
)
.

Several
of
MCD
clinical
manifestations
resemble
those
of
infant
malnutrition
;
we
demonstrated
that
about
one
-
third
of
infants
with
this
common
nutritional
disorder
were
indeed
biotin
-
deficient
,
and
that
this
deficiency
is
metabolically
significant
,
by
studying
urine
instead
of
blood
,
studying
urinary
organic
acids
by
gas
chromatography
-
mass
spectrometry
.

Remarkably
,
the
metabolic
abnormalities
became
apparent
only
after
protein
feeding
was
started
,
suggesting
that
this
phenomenon
may
contribute
to
the
worsening
of
malnourished
individuals
when
they
are
abruptly
fed
.

Afterwards
,
we
studied
biotin
deficiency
at
the
tissue
level
.

Carboxylase
activities
and
masses
were
significantly
reduced
in
liver
,
kidney
,
muscle
,
adipose
tissue
,
intestine
,
and
spleen
,
but
brain
and
heart
were
spared
;
their
mRNAs
remained
unchanged
.

On
the
other
hand
,
holocarboxylase
synthetase
(
HCS
)
mRNA
levels
were
markedly
low
in
the
deficient
animals
,
and
increased
upon
biotin
injection
.

Over
2000
human
genes
have
been
identified
that
depend
on
biotin
for
expression
.

To
probe
into
the
"
logic
"
of
this
enigma
,
we
have
started
comparative
studies
among
evolutionarily
distant
organisms
,
such
as
mouse
and
Saccharomyces
cerevisiae
,
and
we
are
now
looking
for
biotin
effects
on
specific
genes
and
proteins
,
such
as
HCS
and
hexokinases
,
and
on
their
proteomes
.

Involvement
of
COX
-
1
and
up
-
regulated
prostaglandin
E
synthases
in
phosphatidylserine
liposome
-
induced
prostaglandin
E2
production
by
microglia
.

After
engulfment
of
apoptotic
cells
through
phosphatidylserine
(
PS
)
-
mediated
recognition
,
microglia
secrete
prostaglandin
E2
(
PGE2
)
,
a
potent
anti
-
inflammatory
molecule
in
the
central
nervous
system
.

Despite
the
clinical
significance
,
the
mechanism
underlying
PGE2
production
by
phagocytosis
of
apoptotic
cells
is
poorly
understood
.

In
the
present
study
,
we
used
PS
liposomes
to
elucidate
the
phagocytic
pathway
for
PGE2
production
in
microglia
,
because
PS
liposomes
mimic
the
effects
of
apoptotic
cells
on
microglia
/
macrophages
.

The
level
of
PGE2
in
the
culture
medium
of
primary
cultured
rat
microglia
was
significantly
increased
by
PS
liposomes
treatment
but
not
by
phosphatidylcholine
liposomes
treatment
.

The
specific
ligand
for
class
B
scavenger
receptor
(
SR
-
B
)
,
high
density
lipoprotein
,
significantly
suppressed
PS
liposome
-
induced
PGE2
production
.

PS
liposomes
were
immediately
phagocytosed
by
microglia
and
sorted
to
endosomes
/
lysosomes
.

Cyclooxygenase
(
COX
)
-
2
and
membrane
-
bound
prostaglandin
E
synthase
-
1
(
mPGES
-
1
)
were
induced
by
treatment
with
lipopolysaccharide
(
LPS
)
but
not
with
PS
liposomes
.

On
the
other
hand
,
mPGES
-
2
and
cytosolic
PGES
(
cPGES
)
that
are
functionally
coupled
with
COX
-
1
were
upregulated
after
treatment
with
PS
liposomes
or
LPS
.

Furthermore
,
PS
liposome
-
induced
PGE2
production
was
significantly
suppressed
by
indomethacin
,
a
preferential
COX
-
1
inhibitor
,
but
not
by
NS
-
398
,
a
selective
COX
-
2
inhibitor
.

PS
liposomes
induced
activation
of
p44
/
p42
extracellular
signal
-
regulated
kinase
(
ERK
)
but
not
p38
mitogen
-
activated
protein
kinase
in
SR
-
BI
independent
manner
.

These
observations
strongly
suggest
that
the
up
-
regulation
of
terminal
PGESs
that
are
preferentially
coupled
with
COX
-
1
,
especially
mPGES
-
2
,
plays
the
pivotal
role
in
PS
liposome
-
induced
PGE2
production
by
microglia
.

Although
SR
-
BI
plays
an
essential
role
in
PS
liposome
-
induced
PGE2
production
,
other
PS
-
recognizing
receptors
,
possibly
PS
-
specific
receptor
,
could
also
promote
PGE2
production
by
transducing
intracellular
signals
including
p44
/
p42
ERK
after
PS
liposomes
treatment
.

Clear

(
RCC
)
is
characterized
by
the

of

resultant
dysregulation
of
the

Significant
advances
in
the
treatment
of
clear

have
been
derived
from
agents
that
target
these

,
including
the
multiple

(

sorafenib
,
sunitinib
,
and
AG013736
,
which
target
multiple
VEGFRs
as
well
as
PDGFR
-
beta
.

Sorafenib
has
the
added
advantage
of
inhibiting
multiple
different
Raf
isoforms
,
which
enables
it
to
target
TGF

alpha
/

signaling
and
may
also
enhance
its
inhibition
of
VEGFR

This
review
will
examine
the
recent
advances
in
our
understanding
of
the
biology
of

and
show
how
those

have
helped
delineate

A

type
II
citrullinemia
-
-
deterioration
of
clinical
course
after
infusion
of
hyperosmotic
and

solutions
.

BACKGROUND
:
Adult
-
onset
type
II
citrullinemia
(
CTLN2
)
is
an
autosomal
recessive
disorder
caused
by
mutations
of
SLC25A13
gene
encoding
citrin
and
is
characterized
by
recurrent
encephalopathy
with
hyperammonemia
.

Factors
affecting
disease
progression
remain
unknown
.

We
report
a
case
with
CTLN2
,
whose
clinical
course
was
rapidly
worsened
by
the
administration
of
Glyceol
,
a
hyperosmotic
diuretic
solution
consisting
of
10
%
glycerol
and
5
%
fructose
in
saline
.

CASE
REPORT
:
A
34
-
year
-
old
man
was
admitted
in
coma
after
repeated
episodes
of
altered
consciousness
.

His
plasma
ammonia
level
was
markedly
elevated
without
any
evidence
of
liver
diseases
.

Brain
MRI
revealed
high
signal
intensities
at
the
bilateral
cingulate
gyri
and
insular
cortices
,
suggesting
hepatic
encephalopathy
.

We
administered
Glyceol
.
intravenously
to
alleviate
brain
edema
,
however
,
he
developed
intractable
seizures
along
with
steep
increase
in
plasma
ammonia
levels
(
from
808
to
2210
microg
/
dL
)
and
died
.

The
diagnosis
of
CTLN2
was
confirmed
by
elevations
of
plasma
citrulline
level
(

.

CONCLUSIONS
:
Physicians
should
take
CTLN2
into
consideration
as
a
differential
diagnosis
in
Asian
patients
with
a
history
of
repeated
unconsciousness

Inhibition
of
gentamicin
binding
to
rat
renal
brush
-
border
membrane
by
megalin
ligands
and
basic
peptides
.

Our
previous
studies
showed
that
coadministration
of
cytochrome
c
and
a
20
-
residue
basic
peptide
,
N
-
WASP181
-
200
(
NISHTKEKKKGKAKKKRLTK
,
pI
=
10
.
87
)
inhibits
renal
accumulation
of
gentamicin
.

In
this
study
,
we
examined
effects
of
ligands
of
megalin
,
an
endocytic
receptor
involved
in
renal
uptake
of
gentamicin
,
and
basic
peptides
including
N
-
WASP180
-
200
and
its
mutant
peptides
on
gentamicin
binding
to
isolated
rat
renal
brush
-
border
membrane
(
BBM
)
.

Gentamicin
binding
to
BBM
was
inhibited
by
megalin
ligands
,
basic
peptide
fragments
of
cytochrome
c
,
and
N
-
WASP181
-
200
in
a
concentration
-
dependent
manner
.

Klotz
plot
analysis
showed
that
N
-
WASP181
-
200
inhibited
the
binding
of
gentamicin
in
a
competitive
manner
.

By
substituting
glycines
for
lysines
in
N
-
WASP181
-
200
at
positions
9
and
15
,
the
inhibitory
effect
on
gentamicin
binding
to
BBM
was
reduced
,
which
may
be
related
to
a
decrease
in
the
alpha
-
helix
content
in
the
peptide
.

Gentamicin
binding
to
BBM
treated
with
trypsin
,
in
which
megalin
completely
disappeared
,
was
significantly
but
not
completely
decreased
compared
with
the
native
BBM
.

In
addition
,
treatment
of
BBM
with
trypsin
led
to
a
decrease
in
the
inhibitory
effect
of
N
-
WASP181
-
200
on
gentamicin
binding
.

These
observations
support
that
megalin
ligands
and
basic
peptides
including
N
-
WASP181
-
200
decrease
renal
accumulation
of
gentamicin
by
inhibiting
its
binding
to
BBM
of
proximal
tubule
cells
,
partly
interacting
with
megalin
.

In
addition
,
the
alpha
-
helix
conformation
may
play
an
important
role
in
the
inhibitory
effect
of
N
-
WASP181
-
200
on
the
binding
of
gentamicin
to
BBM
.

Thymidylate
synthase
expression
pattern
,
expression
level
and
single
nucleotide
polymorphism
are
predictors
for
disease
-
free
survival
in
patients
of
colorectal
cancer
treated
with
5
-
fluorouracil
.

Several
variables
associated
to
thymidylate
synthase
(
TS
)
,
the
biological
target
of
5
-
fluorouracil
(
5FU
)
have
been
studied
for
their
possible
role
as
predictors
of
the
clinical
outcome
and
response
to
chemotherapy
in
colorectal
cancer
(
CRC
)
patients
.

The
level
of
protein
expression
and
the
number
of
variable
tandem
-
repeats
of
a
28
-
bp
sequence
within
the
gene
promoter
have
been
proposed
as
predictive
and
/
or
prognostic
factors
with
variable
agreement
,
while
consensus
seems
to
be
achieved
with
respect
to
the
value
of
a
single
nucleotide
polymorphism
(
SNP
)
described
within
this
same
region
.

More
recently
,
an
association
between
TS
expression
pattern
and
survival
has
been
disclosed
.

Paraffin
-
embedded
sections
from
140
CRC
patients
were
analyzed
by
immuno
-
histochemistry
(
Mab
TS106
)
for
TS
levels
and
expression
pattern
.

Also
,
VNTR
and
SNP
were
determined
by
polymerase
-
chain
reaction
(
PCR
)
and
restriction
-
length
-
fragment
polymorphism
(
RFLP
)
in
123
and
112
patients
,
respectively
.

Cytoplasmic
expression
pattern
tended
to
be
associated
to
C
SNP
(
p
=
0
.
06
)
.

Low
TS
expression
levels
,
cytoplasmic
expression
pattern
and
C
SNP
arose
as
variables
associated
to
longer
progression
-
free
survival
(
PFS
)
in
patients
treated
with
5FU
.

Accordingly
,
patients
having
at
least
two
favourable
or
unfavourable
variables
were
classified
respectively
as
'
low
risk
'
and
'
high
risk
'
,
the
former
showing
significantly
longer
PFS
(
p
=
0
.
0299
)
.

The
possibility
for
designing
a
selection
method
for
subsequent
therapies
is
suggested
on
the
basis
of
a
probable
combined
effect
of
the
above
mentioned
parameters
but
further
studies
in
larger
populations
are
needed
to
confirm
these
results
.

Leishmania
donovani
singly
deficient
in
HGPRT
,
APRT
or
XPRT
are
viable
in
vitro
and
within
mammalian
macrophages
.

Leishmania
species
express
three
phosphoribosyltransferase
enzymes
,
hypoxanthine
-
guanine
phosphoribosyltransferase
(
HGPRT
)
,
adenine
phosphoribosyltransferase
(
APRT
)
,
and
xanthine
phosphoribosyltransferase
(
XPRT
)
,
which
enable
this
genus
to
acquire
purine
nutrients
from
their
hosts
.

To
test
whether
any
of
these
enzymes
is
essential
for
viability
,
transformation
into
amastigotes
,
and
infectivity
and
proliferation
within
mammalian
macrophages
,
Deltahgprt
,
Deltaaprt
,
and
Deltaxprt
null
mutants
were
created
by
targeted
gene
replacement
within
a
virulent
background
of
Leishmania
donovani
.

Each
of
the
three
knockout
strains
was
viable
as
promastigotes
and
axenic
amastigotes
and
capable
of
maintaining
an
infection
in
bone
marrow
-
derived
murine
macrophages
.

These
data
support
the
hypothesis
that
none
of
the
three
phosphoribosyltransferases
is
essential
for
purine
salvage
or
viability
by
itself
and
that
purine
salvage
occurs
through
multiple
anabolic
routes
in
both
parasite
life
cycle
stages
.

In
addition
these
studies
revealed
the
presence
of
an
adenine
aminohydrolase
enzyme
in
L
.
donovani
axenic
amastigotes
,
an
activity
previously
thought
to
be
restricted
to
promastigotes
.

,
and
absence
of
residues
forming
classical
tertiary
interactions
,
whereas
synthetases
appear
typical
.

This
raises
questions
about
identity
elements
in
mt
-
tRNAs
and
adaptation
of
their
cognate
mt
-
aaRSs
.

We
have
explored
here
the
human
mt
-
aspartate
system
in
which
a
prokaryotic
-
type
AspRS
,
highly
similar
to
the
Escherichia
coli
enzyme
,
recognizes
a
bizarre
tRNA
(
Asp
)
.

Analysis
of
human
mt
-
tRNA
(
Asp
)
transcripts
confirms
the
identity
role
of
the
GUC
anticodon
as
in
other
aspartylation
systems
but
reveals
the
non
-
involvement
of
position
73
.

This
position
is
otherwise
known
as
the
site
of
a
universally
conserved
major
aspartate
identity
element
,
G73
,
also
known
as
a
primordial
identity
signal
.

In
mt
-
tRNA
(
Asp
)
,
position
73
can
be
occupied
by
any
of
the
four
nucleotides
without
affecting
aspartylation
.

Sequence

of
various
AspRSs
allowed

coli
AspRS

)
complex
.

Replacing
this
glycine
by
an
aspartate
renders
human
mt
-
AspRS
more
discriminative
to
G73
.

Restriction
in
the
aspartylation
identity
set
,
driven
by
a
rapid
mutagenic
rate
of
the
mt
-
genome
,
suggests
a
reverse
evolution
of
the

identity
elements
in
regard
to
its
bacterial
ancestor

Metabolic
syndrome
:
adenosine
monophosphate
-
activated
protein
kinase
and
malonyl
coenzyme
A
.

The
metabolic
syndrome
can
be
defined
as
a
state
of
metabolic
dysregulation
characterized
by
insulin
resistance
,
central
obesity
,
and
a
predisposition
to
type
2
diabetes
,
dyslipidemia
,
premature
atherosclerosis
,
and
other
diseases
.

An
increasing
body
of
evidence
has
linked
the
metabolic
syndrome
to
abnormalities
in
lipid
metabolism
that
ultimately
lead
to
cellular
dysfunction
.

We
review
here
the
hypothesis
that
,
in
many
instances
,
the
cause
of
these
lipid
abnormalities
could
be
a
dysregulation
of
the
adenosine
monophosphate
-
activated
protein
kinase
(
AMPK
)
/
malonyl
coenzyme
A
(
CoA
)
fuel
-
sensing
and
signaling
mechanism
.

Such
dysregulation
could
be
reflected
by
isolated
increases
in
malonyl
CoA
or
by
concurrent
changes
in
malonyl
CoA
and
AMPK
,
both
of
which
would
alter
intracellular
fatty
acid
partitioning
.

The
possibility
is
also
raised
that
pharmacological
agents
and
other
factors
that
activate
AMPK
and
/
or
decrease
malonyl
CoA
could
be
therapeutic
targets
.

Chronic
effect
of
[

Pen2
,
D
-

enkephalin
on
rat
brain
opioid
receptors
.

In
previous
studies
,
we
have
demonstrated
that
chronic
etorphine
or
[
D
-
Ala2
,
D
-
Leu5
]
enkephalin
(
DADLE
)
treatment
of
rats
results
in
the
reduction
of
mu
-
and
delta
-
opioid
receptor
binding
activities
as
tolerance
develops
.

As
both
etorphine
and
DADLE
are
relatively
non
-
specific
opioid
ligands
,
interacting
with
both
mu
-
and
delta
-
receptors
,
these
studies
could
not
determine
whether
down
-
regulation
of
a
specific
receptor
type
occurs
.

Therefore
,
in
the
present
studies
,
animals
were
rendered
tolerant
to
the
delta
-
opioid
receptor
-
selective
agonist
[
D

,
D

enkephalin
(
DPDPE
)
,
and
receptor
binding
activities
were
measured
.

Treating
Sprague

Dawley
rats
with
increasing
doses
of

-
320
micrograms

)
i

c

v
.
for
1
to
4
days
resulted
in
a
time
-
dependent
increase
in
the
AD50
of
DPDPE
to
elicit
an
antinociceptive
response
.

When
delta
-
receptor
binding
was
determined
by
using
[
3H
]
DPDPE
,
a
40
-
50
%
decrease
in
binding
in
the
midbrain
and
cortex
,
and
25
-
35
%
decrease
in
binding
in
the
striatum
were
observed
after
3
or
4
days
of
DPDPE
treatment
.

Scatchard
analysis
of
the
[
3H
]
DPDPE
saturation
binding
data
revealed
a
decrease
in
Bmax
values
and
no
significant
change
in
Kd
values
.

To
our
surprise
,
when
mu
-
receptor
binding
was
determined
by
using
[
3H
]
Tyr
-
D
-
Ala
-
Gly
-
MePhe
-
Gly

ol
(

,
a
10

15
%
decrease
in
binding
was
also
observed
in
the
midbrain
and
cortex
after
4
days
of
DPDPE
treatment
.

Our
conclusion
is
that
chronic
DPDPE
treatment
preferentially
reduces
delta
-
opioid
receptor
binding
activity
.

Its
minor
effect
on
the
mu
-
opioid
receptor
maybe
due
to
an
interaction
between
delta

and
mu

binding
sites
.

Implications
of
serotoninergic

systems
in
their
central

in
rats
]
.

The
effects
of
two
antidepressant
drugs
,
amoxapine
and
amitriptyline
,
that
belong
to
distinct
chemical
classes
,
have
been
examined
on
various
biochemical
parameters
related
to
serotoninergic
and
opioidergic
neurotransmission
in
the
rat
brain
and
spinal
cord
.

In

binding
studies
showed
that
both
amoxapine
and
amitriptyline
interact
in
the
nanomolar
range
with
5
-
HT2
receptors
labelled
by
[
3H
]
ketanserin
in
cortical
membranes
.

By
contrast
,
neither
amoxapine
nor
amitriptyline
can
be
considered
as
possible
ligands
of
5
-
HT1A
and
5
-
HT1B
receptors
because
their
affinities
for
these
sites
are
in
the
micromolar
range
(
or
even
worse
)
.

Interestingly
,
amoxapine
binds
with
a
good
affinity
(
IC50
=
0
.
30
microM
)
to
5
-
HT3
receptors
labelled
by
[

]
zacopride
in
cortical
membranes
.

Complementary
experiments
using
the
5
-
HT3
-

Jarisch
reflex
confirmed
that
amoxapine
really
acts
in
vivo
as
a
5
-
HT3
antagonist
(
IC50
=
50
micrograms
/

i
.
v
.
)
,
whereas
amitriptyline
is
essentially
inactive
on
5
-
HT3
receptors
.

The
second
part
of
this
study
consisted
of
looking
for
possible
changes
in
central
5
-
HT
receptors
24
h
after
either
a
single
or
a
repeated
(
for
14
days
)
treatment
with
amoxapine
(

p
.
each
day
)
or
amitriptyline
(
10
mg
/
kg
i
.
p
.
)
.

A
marked
decrease
in
the
density
of
5
-
HT2
receptors
was
found
in
the
cerebral
cortex
in
both
treatment
groups
.

By
contrast
,
neither
5
-
HT1A
nor
5
-
HT1B
receptors
were
significantly
affected
in
any
brain
region
studied
.

Finally
we
explored
whether
acute
and
/
or
chronic
administration
of
amoxapine
or
amitriptyline
affected
the
levels
of
opioid
peptides
and
the
mu

of
opioid

in
various
regions
of
the

and
the

The

of
this

was
to
characterize
a

How
may
anticancer
chemotherapy
with
fluorouracil
be
individualised
?

Fluorouracil
is
used
clinically
against
various
solid
tumours
.

Both
fluorouracil
toxicity
and
pharmacokinetics
vary
highly
within
and
between
individuals
.

The
reasons
why
doses
are
not
individualised
routinely
are
difficulties
in
defining
,
predicting
and
achieving
an
optimal
fluorouracil
exposure
or
dose
because
of
a
narrow
therapeutic
index
,
nonlinear
pharmacokinetics
,
variabilities
in
administration
rates
and
metabolism
,
and
in
targets
like
thymidylate
synthase
.

To
individualise
fluorouracil
administration
before
the
first
dose
,
assessment
of
the
individual
dihydropyrimidine
dehydrogenase
(
DPD
)
activity
may
be
useful
,
because
this
genetically
highly
polymorphic
enzyme
controls
approximately
80
%
of
fluorouracil
elimination
.

A
complete
or
partial
loss
of
DPD
activity
in
0
.
1
and
3
-
5
%
of
Caucasians
,
respectively
,
leads
to
increased
fluorouracil
exposure
and
toxicity
.

Several
methods
to
assess
DPD
activity
in
patients
have
been
proposed
(
genotyping
,
various
phenotyping
methods
)
,
but
each
of
them
has
limitations
,
as
has
the
fluorouracil
test
dose
approach
.

To
adapt
exposure
towards
fluorouracil
a
priori
,
a
combination
of
genotyping
and
phenotyping
may
yield
better
prediction
of
toxicity
than
one
method
alone
.

A
prerequisite
for
dose
adaptation
is
the
definition
of
fluorouracil
exposure
ranges
with
sufficient
therapeutic
activity
,
but
without
serious
toxicity
.

While
an
increased
risk
of
leukopenia
,
diarrhoea
,
stomatitis
,
and
hand
-
foot
syndrome
during
continuous
5
-
day
infusions
was
related
to
fluorouracil
exposures
above
an
area
under
the
plasma
concentration
-
time
curve
(
AUC
)
threshold
of
25
-
30
mg
.
h
/
L
,
tumour
response
was
higher
when
an
AUC
of
approximately
30
mg
.
h
/
L
was
achieved
,
illustrating
the
extremely
narrow
therapeutic
window
of
fluorouracil
.

Pharmacokinetic
target
values
are
less
clear
for
other
regimens
,
including
chronomodulated
regimens
,
which
yielded
a
superior
clinically
efficacy
and
tolerability
in
several
trials
.

However
,
the
monitoring
of
fluorouracil
plasma
concentrations
seems
principally
useful
for
individual
a
posteriori
dose
adjustment
.

Whether
an
adaptation
of
the
fluorouracil
starting
dose
to
the
results
of
two
DPD
activity
tests
before
fluorouracil
administration
a
priori
,
and
the
adaptation
of
doses
to
fluorouracil
exposure
a
posteriori
is
a
reasonable
approach
to
better
prevent
toxicity
and
increase
efficacy
,
remains
to
be
evaluated
in
randomised
clinical
studies
comparing
these
strategies
to
routine
clinical
safety
monitoring
.

Expression
of
basic
fibroblast
growth
factor
correlates
with
resistance
to
paclitaxel
in
human
patient
tumors
.

BACKGROUND
:
Preclinical
results
indicate
acidic
fibroblast
growth
factor
(
aFGF
)
and
basic
FGF
(
bFGF
)
present
in
solid
tumors
as
a
cause
of
broad
-
spectrum
chemoresistance
,
whereas
earlier
clinical
studies
suggest
that
bFGF
expression
is
associated
with
opposing
outcomes
in
patients
.

We
investigated
the
relationship
between
FGF
expression
and
paclitaxel
activity
in
tumors
from
bladder
,
breast
,
head
and
neck
,
ovarian
,
and
prostate
cancer
patients
.

MATERIALS
AND
METHODS
:
Tumors
(
n
=
96
)
were
maintained
in
three
-
dimensional
histocultures
,
retaining
tumor
-
stromal
interaction
.

Bladder
tumors
were
treated
with
paclitaxel
for
2
h
,
and
the
other
tumors
for
24
h
.

Antiproliferative
and
proapoptotic
effects
of
paclitaxel
were
quantified
and
correlated
with
expression
of
aFGF
,
bFGF
,
P
-
glycoprotein
(
Pgp
)
,
p53
,
and
bcl
-

.

RESULTS
:
Fifty
-
one
percent
(
49
/
96
)
and
63
%
(
61
/
96
)
of
tumors
showed
aFGF
and
bFGF
staining
,
respectively
.

aFGF
expression
was
positively
correlated
with
tumor
stage
(
p
<
0
.
01
)
,
and
bFGF
expression
with
tumor
grade
and
Pgp
expression
(
p
<
0
.
05
)
.

Paclitaxel
inhibited
antiproliferation
in
86
%
of
tumors
(
83
/
96
)
,
with
an
average
inhibition
of
46
+
/
-
19
%
(
mean
+
/
-
SD
)
in
the
responding
tumors
.

Paclitaxel
also
induced
apoptosis
in
96
%
of
tumors
(
92
/
96
)
,
with
an
average
apoptotic
index
of
12
+
/
-
7
%
in
the
responding
tumors
.

aFGF
expression
did
not
correlate
with
tumor
sensitivity
to
paclitaxel
,
whereas
bFGF
expression
showed
an
inverse
correlation
(
p
<
0
.
01
)
.

bFGF
expression
was
a
stronger
predictor
of
paclitaxel
resistance
compared
to
Pgp
,
p53
,
or
Bcl
-
2
.

CONCLUSION
:
These
results
support
a
role
of
bFGF
in
paclitaxel
resistance
in
human
patient
tumors
.

Thyroid
hormone
receptor
expression
in
the
obligatory
paedomorphic
salamander
Necturus
maculosus
.

Amphibian
metamorphosis
is
under
the
strict
control
of
thyroid
hormones
(
TH
)
.

These
hormones
induce
metamorphosis
by
controlling
gene
expression
through
binding
to
thyroid
hormone
receptors
(
TRs
)
.

Necturus
maculosus
is
considered
to
be
an
obligatory
paedomorphic
Amphibian
since
metamorphosis
never
occurs
spontaneously
and
cannot
be
induced
by
pharmacological
means
.

Since
metamorphosis
depends
on
the
acquisition
of
response
of
tadpole
tissues
to
thyroid
hormone
,
we
aimed
to
determine
TR
gene
expression
patterns
in
Necturus
maculosus
as
well
as
the
expression
of
two
TH
-
related
genes
:
Cytosolic
Thyroid
Hormone
-
Binding
Protein
(
CTHBP
)
-
M2
-
pyruvate
kinase
,
a
gene
encoding
a
cytosolic
TH
binding
protein
and
stromelysin
3
,
a
direct
TH
target
gene
in
Xenopus
laevis
.

Tissue
samples
were
obtained
from
specimens
of
Necturus
maculosus
.

We
performed
in
situ
hybridization
using
non
-
cross
-
hybridizing
RNA
probes
obtained
from
the
cloned
Necturus
TRalpha
and
TRbeta
genes
.

We
found
clear
expression
of
Necturus
TRalpha
gene
in
several
tissues
including
the
central
nervous
system
,
epithelial
cells
of
digestive
and
urinary
organs
,
as
well
as
myocardium
and
skeletal
muscle
.

TRbeta
was
also
expressed
in
the
brain
.

In
other
tissues
,
hybridization
signals
were
too
low
to
draw
reliable
conclusions
about
their
precise
distribution
.

In
addition
,
we
observed
that
the
expression
of
CTHBP
and
ST3
is
largely
distinct
from
that
of
TRs
.

The
fact
that
we
observed
a
clear
expression
of
TRalpha
and
TRbeta
which
are
evolutionary
conserved
,
suggests
that
Necturus
tissues
express
TRs
.

Our
results
thus
indicate
that
,
in
contrast
to
previously
held
hypotheses
,
Necturus
tissues
are
TH
responsive
.

Regulation
of
retinal
dehydrogenases
and
retinoic
acid
synthesis
by
cholesterol
metabolites
.

Retinoic
acid
(
RA
)
constitutes
the
major
active
ingredient
of
vitamin
A
and
is
required
for
various
biological
processes
.

The
tissue
RA
level
is
maintained
through
a
cascade
of
metabolic
reactions
where
retinal
dehydrogenases
(
RALDHs
)
catalyze
the
terminal
reaction
of
RA
biosynthesis
from
retinal
,
a
rate
-
limiting
step
.

We
showed
that
dietary
supplement
of
cholesterol
enhanced
the
expression
of
RALDH1
and
2
genes
and
the
cellular
RA
content
in
vital
organs
such
as
brain
,
kidney
,
liver
and
heart
.

Consistently
,
the
cholesterol
-
lowering
agent
(
pravastatin
sodium
)
downregulated
the
expression
of
RALDH1
and
2
genes
in
several
organs
especially
the
liver
and
in
cultured
liver
cells
.

Further
,
cholesterol
metabolites
,
predominantly
the
oxysterols
,
the
natural
ligands
for
liver
X
receptor
(
LXR
)
,
induced
these
genes
via
upregulation
of
sterol
regulatory
element
binding
protein
-
1c
(
SREBP
-
1c
)
that
bound
to
the
regulatory
regions
of
these
genes
.

Knockdown
of
LXRalpha
/
beta
or
SREBP
-
1c
downregulated
the
expression
of
RALDH
genes
,
which
could
be
rescued
by
re
-
expressing
SREBP
-
1c
,
suggesting
SREBP
-
1c
as
a
direct
positive
regulator
for
these
genes
.

This
study
uncovered
a
novel
crosstalk
between
cholesterol
and
RA
biosynthesis
.

Reelin
down
-
regulation
in
mice
and
psychosis
endophenotypes
.

Reelin
,
a
large
glycoprotein
secreted
by
telencephalic
GABAergic
neurons
,
plays
an
important
role
in
neuronal
guidance
embryonically
and
in
synaptic
plasticity
postnatally
.

The
reeler
heterozygous
mouse
(
+
/
rl
)
appears
superficially
normal
but
has
been
of
interest
as
an
animal
model
for
psychosis
since
the
discovery
that
reelin
is
50
%
down
-
regulated
in
postmortem
psychotic
brain
.

Brain
abnormalities
in
+
/
rl
are
similar
to
psychotic
brain
and
include
a
reduction
in
glutamic
acid
de
carboxylase
67
(
GAD67
)
,
dendritic
arbors
and
spine
density
in
cortex
and
hippocampus
,
and
abnormalities
in
synaptic
function
including
long
-
term
potentiation
(
LTP
)
.

In
spite
of
these
abnormalities
,
behavioral
abnormalities
in
+
/
rl
are
subtle
and
controversial
.

Recent
findings
indicate
that
the
reelin
(
RELN
)
and
GAD67
promoters
are
hypermethylated
in
GABAergic
neurons
of
psychotic
postmortem
brain
and
that
DNA
methyltransferase
1
(
DNMT1
)
is
up
-
regulated
.

Hypermethlyation
of
RELN
and
GAD67
promoters
can
be
induced
by
treating
mice
with
methionine
,
and
these
mice
display
brain
and
behavioral
abnormalities
similar
to
+
/
rl
.

Thus
,
an
animal
model
that
combines
genetic
heterozygocity
with
epigenesis
holds
promise
for
understanding
the
role
of
Reelin
down
-
regulation
in
psychosis
.

Functional
and
bioenergetic
consequences
of
AT1
antagonist
olmesartan
medoxomil
in
hearts
with
postinfarction
LV
remodeling
.

The
structural
left
ventricular
(
LV
)
remodeling
and
contractile
dysfunction
of
hearts
with
postinfarction
LV
remodeling
are
benefited
by
angiotensin

type
1
receptor
(
AT1
)
blocker
.

However
,
the
myocardial
bioenergetic
consequences
of
AT1
blocker
in
these
hearts
are
not
known
.

To
investigate
,
we
used
a
porcine
model
of
postinfarction
LV
remodeling
produced
by
ligation
of
the
left
circumflex
coronary
artery
.

After
infarction
,
7
pigs
received
olmesartan
medoxomil
(
2
mg
/
kg
)
for
comparison
against
9
untreated
and
10
normal
pigs
.

Measurements
of
hemodynamics
,
myocardial
perfusion
,
and
myocardial
bioenergetics
were
taken
7
weeks
postinfarction
.

The
treated
group
had
an
LV

body

ratio
significantly
lower
than
the
untreated
group
(

and

respectively
)
.

The
untreated
group
had
a
mean
aortic
pressure
significantly
higher
than
the
control
(

and

respectively
)
.

The
subendocardial
phosphocreatine
-
to
-
ATP
ratios
of
the
treated
group
were
significantly
higher
than
that
of
the
untreated
group
.

The
untreated
group
,
but
not
the
treated
group
,
had
significant
reductions
in
mitochondrial
F0F1
-
ATPase
subunits
compared
with
controls
.

Congestive
heart
failure
as
evidenced
by
significant
ascites
(
100
to
2000
mL
)
developed
in
4
of
the
9
untreated
animals
,
but
was
absent
in
the

.

Animals
with
heart
failure
demonstrated
reductions
in
both
mitochondrial
F0F1
-
ATPase
expression
and
myocardial
high
-
energy
phosphate
levels
.

Thus
,
severe
LV
dysfunction
and
accompanying
abnormal
myocardial
bioenergetic
phenotype
were
prevented
by
the
AT1
antagonist
olmesartan
medoxomil
.

Regulation
of
retinoic
acid
receptors
alpha
,
beta
and
retinoid
X
receptor
alpha
after
sciatic
nerve
injury
.

Cell
culture
experiments
indicated
that
activation
of
the
retinoic
acid
signaling
system
is
involved
in
axonal
regeneration
.

This
hypothesis
was
tested
with
sciatic
nerve
injury
in
the
rat
.

Since
the
effect
of
retinoic
acid
is
mediated
via
retinoic
acid
receptors
and
retinoid
X
receptors
,
we
investigated
mRNA
and
protein
expression
of
these
receptors
during
injury
-
induced
degeneration
and
regeneration
.

Seven
days
after
crush
injury
,
transcript
concentrations
of
all
retinoic
acid
receptors
and
of
retinoid
X
receptor
alpha
were
significantly
higher
than
in
non
-
lesioned
nerves
.

Protein
levels
of
retinoic
acid
receptor
alpha
,
retinoic
acid
receptor
beta
and
retinoid
X
receptor
alpha
were
upregulated
4
,
7
and
14
days
after
injury
.

In
degenerating
nerves
a
significant
increase
of
retinoic
acid
receptor
alpha
was
detected
7
and
14
days
,
and
of
retinoic
acid
receptor
beta
14
and
21
days
after
complete
transection
.

Immunohistochemical
staining
of
retinoid
receptors
revealed
their
expression
in
Schwann
cells
and
macrophages
.

In
addition
,
we
observed
that
retinoic
acid
receptor
alpha
and
retinoid
X
receptor
alpha
appeared
in
the
cell
nuclei
of
macrophages
during
the
lesion
-
induced
inflammatory
reaction
,
and
that
retinoid
X
receptor
alpha
-
staining
co
-
localized
with
some
regenerating
axons
.

Experiments
with
Schwann
cell
primary
cultures
revealed
an
effect
of
retinoic
acid
on
the
expression
of
the
neuregulin
receptor
ErbB3
,
suggesting
that
one
function
of
retinoic
acid
consists
in
the
regulation
of
neuroglial
interactions
after
peripheral
nerve
injury
.

Cellular
effects
of
imatinib
on
medullary
thyroid
cancer
cells
harboring
multiple
endocrine
neoplasia
Type
2A
and
2B
associated
RET
mutations
.

BACKGROUND
:
Activating
mutations
in
the
RET
gene
,
which
encodes
a
tyrosine
kinase
receptor
,
often
cause
medullary
thyroid
carcinoma
(
MTC
)
.

Surgical
resection
is
the
only
curative
treatment
;
no
effective
systemic
treatment
is
available
.

We
evaluated
imatinib
,
a
tyrosine
kinase
inhibitor
currently
used
to
treat
chronic
myelogenous
leukemia
and
gastrointestinal
stromal
tumors
,
as
a
potential
drug
for
systemic
treatment
of
MTC
,
in
2
MTC
-
derived
cell
lines
expressing
multiple
endocrine
neoplasia
-
associated

.

METHODS
:
We
determined
RET
expression
and
Y1062
phosphorylation
using
Western
blot
analysis
and
quantitative
polymerase
chain
reaction
.

We
determined
the
effects
on
cell
proliferation
by
a

-
dimethylthiazol

,
and
we
used

with
annexin
V
/
propidium
iodide
staining
to
study
imatinib
-
induced
cell

,
apoptosis
,
and
cell
death
.

RESULTS
:
Imatinib
inhibited
RET
Y1062
phosphorylation
in
a
dose

dependent
manner
after
1
.
5
hours
of
exposure
.

After
16
hours
both
RET
Y1062
phosphorylation
and
protein
expression
levels
were
affected
.

Dose
-
dependent
decreases
in
cell
proliferation
of
both
cell
lines
after
exposure
to
imatinib
with
inhibitory
concentration
of
50
%
levels
of
23
+
/
-
2
micromol
/
L
and
25
+

-
4
micromol

were
seen
.

These
values
are
high
,
compared
with
those
for
chronic
myelogenous
leukemia
and
gastrointestinal
stromal
tumors
.

We
further
could
show
that
imatinib
induced
cell
-
cycle

,
and
apoptotic
and
nonapoptotic
cell
death
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
Imatinib
inhibits
RET
-
mediated
MTC
cell
growth
affecting
RET
protein
levels
in
vitro
in
a
dose
-
dependent
manner
.

The
concentration
of
imatinib
necessary
to
inhibit
RET
in
vitro
,
however
,
makes
it
impossible
to
conclude
that
imatinib
monotherapy
will
be
a
good
option
for
systemic
therapy
of
MTC
.

Cell
biology
of
molybdenum
.

The
transition
element
molybdenum
(
Mo
)
is
of
essential
importance
for
(
nearly
)
all
biological
systems
as
it
is
required
by
enzymes
catalyzing
diverse
key
reactions
in
the
global
carbon
,
sulfur
and
nitrogen
metabolism
.

The
metal
itself
is
biologically
inactive
unless
it
is
complexed
by
a
special
cofactor
.

With
the
exception
of
bacterial
nitrogenase
,
where
Mo
is
a
constituent
of
the
FeMo
-
cofactor
,
Mo
is
bound
to
a
pterin
,
thus
forming
the
molybdenum
cofactor
(
Moco
)
which
is
the
active
compound
at
the
catalytic
site
of
all
other
Mo
-
enzymes
.

In
eukaryotes
,
the
most
prominent
Mo
-
enzymes
are
(
1
)
sulfite
oxidase
,
which
catalyzes
the
final
step
in
the
degradation
of
sulfur
-
containing
amino
acids
and
is
involved
in
detoxifying
excess
sulfite
,
(
2
)
xanthine
dehydrogenase
,
which
is
involved
in
purine
catabolism
and
reactive
oxygen
production
,
(
3
)
aldehyde
oxidase
,
which
oxidizes
a
variety
of
aldehydes
and
is
essential
for
the
biosynthesis
of
the
phytohormone
abscisic
acid
,
and
in
autotrophic
organisms
also
(
4
)
nitrate
reductase
,
which
catalyzes
the
key
step
in
inorganic
nitrogen
assimilation
.

All
Mo
-
enzymes
,
except
plant
sulfite
oxidase
,
need
at
least
one
more
redox
active
center
,
many
of
them
involving
iron
in
electron
transfer
.

The
biosynthesis
of
Moco
involves
the
complex
interaction
of
six
proteins
and
is
a
process
of
four
steps
,
which
also
includes
iron
as
well
as
copper
in
an
indispensable
way
.

Moco
as
released
after
synthesis
is
likely
to
be
distributed
to
the
apoproteins
of
Mo
-
enzymes
by
putative
Moco
-
carrier
proteins
.

Xanthine
dehydrogenase
and
aldehyde
oxidase
,
but
not
sulfite
oxidase
and
nitrate
reductase
,
require
the
post
-
translational
sulfuration
of
their
Mo
-
site
for
becoming
active
.

This
final
maturation
step
is
catalyzed
by
a
Moco
-
sulfurase
enzyme
,
which
mobilizes
sulfur
from
l
-
cysteine
in
a
pyridoxal
phosphate
-
dependent
manner
as
typical
for
cysteine
desulfurases
.

[
Retinoid
therapy
for
autoimmune
diseases
]
.

Retinoid
is
a
collective
term
for
compounds
which
bind
to
and
activate
retinoic
acid
receptors
(
RARalpha
,
beta
,
gamma
and
RXRalpha
,
beta
,
gamma
)
,
members
of
nuclear
hormone
receptor
superfamily
.

The
most
important
endogeneous
retinoid
is
all
-
trans
-
retinoic
acid
(
ATRA
)
which
is
an
RARalpha
,
beta
and
gamma
ligand
.

ATRA
and
its
mimics
have
been
in
clinical
use
for
treatment
of
acute
promyelocytic
leukemia
(
APL
)
and
some
skin
diseases
.

Many
synthetic
retinoids
have
been
developed
and
attempts
to
improve
their
medicinal
properties
have
been
made
.

Among
them
,
tamibarotene
(
Am80
)
is
an
RARalpha
-
and
RARbeta
-
specific
(
but
RARgamma
-
and
RXRs
-
nonbinding
)
synthetic
retinoid
that
is
effective
in
the
treatment
of
psoriasis
patients
and
relapsed
APL
.

Experimentally
,
this
compound
is
also
active
in
animal
models
of
rheumatoid
arthritis
and
experimental
autoimmune
encephalomyelitis
.

On
this
background
,
possible
application
of
retinoids
for
the
treatment
of
autoimmune
diseases
was
discussed
.

In
particular
,
Th1
dominant
autoimmune
diseases
may
be
the
targets
of
the
retinoids
.

Simvastatin
regulates
non
-
neuronal
cholinergic
activity
in
T
lymphocytes
via
CD11a
-
mediated
pathways
.

Lymphocyte
function
associated
antigen
-
1
(
LFA
-
1
;
CD11a
/
CD18
)
is
an
important
mediator
of
leukocyte
migration
and
T
cell
activation
.

We
previously
showed
that
antithymocyte
globulin
stimulates
an
independent
,
non
-
neuronal
cholinergic
system
in
T
cells
via
LFA
-
1
-
mediated
pathways
,
as
evidenced
by
increases
in
acetylcholine
(
ACh
)
synthesis
and
choline
acetyltransferase
(
ChAT
)
mRNA
expression
.

The
cholesterol
-
lowering
drug
simvastatin
inhibits
LFA
-
1
signaling
by
binding
to
an
allosteric
site
on
CD11a
(
LFA
-
1
alpha
chain
)
,
which
leads
to
immunomodulation
.

In
the
present
study
,
we
investigated
whether
simvastatin
modulates
lymphocytic
cholinergic
activity
in
T
cells
.

We
found
that
anti
-
CD11a
monoclonal
antibody
(
mAb
)
increased
ChAT
activity
,
ACh
synthesis
and
release
,
and
expression
of
ChAT
and
M5
muscarinic
ACh
receptor
mRNA
in
MOLT
-
3
cells
,
a
human
leukemic
T
cell
line
.

Simvastatin
abolished
these
anti
-
CD11a
mAb
-
induced
increases
in
lymphocytic
cholinergic
activity
in
a
manner
independent
of
its
cholesterol
-
lowering
activity
.

These
results
indicate
that
LFA
-
1
contributes
to
the
regulation
of
lymphocytic
cholinergic
activity
via
CD11a
-
mediated
pathways
,
and
suggest
that
simvastatin
exerts
its
immunosuppressive
effects
in
part
via
modification
of
lymphocytic
cholinergic
activity
.

More
than
cool
:
promiscuous
relationships
of
menthol
and
other
sensory
compounds
.

Several
temperature
-
activated
transient
receptor
potential
(
thermoTRP
)
ion
channels
are
the
molecular
receptors
of
natural
compounds
that
evoke
thermal
and
pain
sensations
.

Menthol
,
popularly
known
for
its
cooling
effect
,
activates
TRPM8
-
-
a
cold
-
activated
thermoTRP
ion
channel
.

However
,
human
physiological
studies
demonstrate
a
paradoxical
role
of
menthol
in
modulation
of
warm
sensation
,
and
here
,
we
show
that
menthol
also
activates
heat
-
activated
TRPV3
.

We
further
show
that
menthol
inhibits
TRPA1
,
potentially
explaining
the
use
of
menthol
as
an
analgesic
.

Similar
to
menthol
,
both
camphor
and
cinnamaldehyde
(
initially
reported
to
be
specific
activators
of
TRPV3
and
TRPA1
,
respectively
)
also
modulate
other
thermoTRPs
.

Therefore
,
we
find
that
many
"
sensory
compounds
"
presumed
to
be
specific
have
a
promiscuous
relationship
with
thermoTRPs
.

Effect
of

,
also
known
as

as
well
as
stromal
cells
.

Since
KGF
expressed
in
epithelial
cells
of
benign
prostatic
hyperplasia
(
BPH
)
and
in
prostate
cancer
,
it
has
been
suggested
that
KGF
might
act
as
an
autocrine
factor
in
BPH
and
prostate
cancer
.

To
investigate
the
roles
of
KGF
in
cancerous
stroma
,
primary
cultured
human
prostate
cancer
stromal
cells
(
PCSCs
)
were
isolated
and
evaluated
.

These
PCSCs
possessed
estrogen
receptors
and
KGFR
,
but
not
androgen
receptor
as
determined
by
RT
-
PCR
and
Western
blot
,
respectively
.

KGF
exhibited
mitogenic
and
anti
-
apoptotic
effects
that
correlated
with
induction
of
cyclin
-
D1
,
Bcl
-
2
,
Bcl
-
xL
and
phospho
-
Akt
expression
in
PCSCs
,
where
treatment
with
KGF
antiserum
abolished
cell
proliferation
and
anti
-
apoptotic
protein
expression
.

PCSCs
exposed
to
KGF
for
various
time
periods
resulted
in
phosphorylation
of
Akt
and
subsequent
up
-
regulation
of
Bcl
-
2
.

KGF
modulated
dynamic
protein
expression
indicated
that
KGF
triggered
cell
cycle
machinery
and
then
activated
anti
-
apoptotic
actions
in
PCSCs
.

Cell
proliferation
analysis
indicated
that
tamoxifen
or
ICI
182
,
780
reduced
cell
viability
in
a
dose
-
dependent
manner
;
however
,
KGF
prevented
this
inhibition
,
which
further
demonstrated
KGF
triggered
anti
-
apoptotic
machinery
through
activating
Bcl
-
2
and
phospho
-
Akt
expression
.

In
summary
,
KGF
has
an
autocrine
effect
and
serves
as
a
survival
factor
in
primary
cultured
human
prostate
cancer
stromal
cells
.

The
glutamate
-
aspartate
transporter
GLAST
mediates
glutamate
uptake
at
inner
hair
cell
afferent
synapses
in
the
mammalian
cochlea
.

Ribbon
synapses
formed
between
inner
hair
cells
(
IHCs
)
and
afferent
dendrites
in
the
mammalian
cochlea
can
sustain
high
rates
of
release
,
placing
strong
demands
on
glutamate
clearance
mechanisms
.

To
investigate
the
role
of
transporters
in
glutamate
removal
at
these
synapses
,
we
made
whole
-
cell
recordings
from
IHCs
,
afferent
dendrites
,
and
glial
cells
adjacent
to
IHCs
[
inner
phalangeal
cells
(
IPCs
)
]
in
whole
-
mount
preparations
of
rat
organ
of
Corti
.

Focal
application
of
the
transporter
substrate
D
-
aspartate
elicited
inward
currents
in
IPCs
,
which
were
larger
in
the
presence
of
anions
that
permeate
the
transporter
-
associated
anion
channel
and
blocked
by
the
transporter
antagonist
D
,
L
-
threo
-
beta
-
benzyloxyaspartate
.

These
currents
were
produced
by
glutamate
-
aspartate
transporters
(
GLAST
)
(
excitatory
amino
acid
transporter
1
)
because
they
were
weakly
inhibited
by
dihydrokainate
,
an
antagonist
of
glutamate
transporter
-
1
(
excitatory
amino
acid
transporter
2
)
and
were
absent
from
IPCs
in
GLAST
-
/
-
cochleas
.

Furthermore
,
D
-
aspartate
-
induced
currents
in
outside
-
out
patches
from
IPCs
exhibited
larger
steady
-
state
currents
than
responses
elicited
by
L
-
glutamate
,
a
prominent
feature
of
GLAST
,
and
examination
of
cochlea
from
GLAST
-
Discosoma
red
(
DsRed
)
promoter
reporter
mice
revealed
that
DsRed
expression
was
restricted
to
IPCs
and
other
supporting
cells
surrounding
IHCs
.

Saturation
of
transporters
by
photolysis
of
caged
D
-
aspartate
failed
to
elicit
transporter
currents
in
IHCs
,
as
did
local
application
of
D
-
aspartate
to
afferent
terminals
,
indicating
that
neither
presynaptic
nor
postsynaptic
membranes
are
major
sites
for
glutamate
removal
.

These
data
indicate
that
GLAST
in
supporting
cells
is
responsible
for
transmitter
uptake
at
IHC
afferent
synapses
.

In
pithed
rats
,
labetalol
and

combination
were
given
orally
either
at
doses

were

respectively
.

Effects
were

administration
of
either
phenylephrine
(
at
doses
which
increased
the
mean

)
or

(
at
doses
that
increased

.

.

In
pithed
rats
,
labetalol
and
the
RR

combination
antagonized
,
in
a

manner
,
the
pressor
effect
of
phenylephrine
(
P

)
and
the
chronotropic
effect
of
isoprenaline
(
P
less
than

)
.

Following
both
oral
and
intravenous
dosing
,
the
RR
-
SR
combination
was
twice
potent
as
labetalol
in
terms
of
alpha
1
-
and
beta
1
-
adrenoceptor
antagonism
at
equivalent
doses
.

.

Labetalol
and
the
enantiomers
lacked
affinity
at
alpha
2
-
adrenoceptors
while
at
alpha
1
-
adrenoceptors
the
order
of
potency
was
prazosin
much
greater
than
RR
-
SR
greater
than
labetalol
.

At
beta
1
-
adrenoceptors
,
the
affinity
of
the
compound
RR
-
SR
was
about
3
times
that
of
labetalol
.
5
.

As
labetalol
is
a
mixture
of
active
(
RR
and
SR
)
and
inactive
(
SS
and
SR
)
enantiomers
(
in
terms
of
alpha
and
beta
receptor
actions
)
,
the
combination
of
RR
and
SR
may
be
a
valuable
substitute
for
labetalol
in
the
treatment
of
systemic
hypertension
.

Although
the
potential
for
non
-
specific
side
effects
(
common
to
all
four
enantiomers
)
could
be
expected
to
be
diminished
,
recent
reports
by
postmarketing
surveillance
indicate
that
the
RR
isomer
(
dilevalol
)
can
induce
liver
toxicity
.

Interestingly
,
labetalol
is
devoid
of
this
effect
;
whether
the
combination
of
RR
and
SR
enantiomers
could
be
of
clinical
importance
warrants
further
investigation
.

Overexpression
of
proline
oxidase
induces
proline
-
dependent
and
mitochondria
-
mediated
apoptosis
.

Proline
oxidase
(
POX
)
,
a
mitochondrial
inner
-
membrane
protein
,
catalyzes
the
rate
-
limiting
oxidation
of
proline
to
pyrroline
-
5
-
carboxylate
(
P5C
)
.

Previously
we
showed
that
overexpression
of
POX
is
associated
with
generation
of
reactive
oxygen
species
(
ROS
)
and
apoptosis
in
POX
-
inducible
colorectal
cancer
cells
,
DLD
-
1
.
POX
.

We
also
showed
expression
of
mitochondrial
MnSOD
partially
blunts
POX
-
induced
ROS
generation
and
apoptosis
.

To
further
investigate
the
molecular
basis
of
POX
-
induced
apoptosis
,
we
utilized
the
DLD
-
1
.
POX
cells
to
show
that
cells
overproducing
POX
exhibit
an
L
-
proline
-
dependent
apoptotic
response
.

The
apoptotic
effect
is
specific
for
L
-
proline
,
detectable
at
0
.
2
mM
,
maximal
at
1
mM
,
and
occurs
during
48
-
72
h
following
the
addition
of
L
-
proline
to
cells
with
maximally
induced
POX
.

The
apoptotic
response
is
mitochondria
-
mediated
with
release
of
cytochrome
c
,
activation
of
caspase
-
9
,
chromatin
condensation
/
DNA
fragmentation
,
and
cell
shrinkage
.

We
conclude
that
in
the
presence
of
proline
,
high
POX
activity
is
sufficient
to
induce
mitochondria
-
mediated
apoptosis
.

The
effects
of
norepinephrine
transporter
inactivation
on
locomotor
activity
in
mice
.

BACKGROUND
:
Acute
administration
of
different
classes
of
antidepressants
can
enhance
or
reduce
spontaneous
locomotor
activity
in
a
novel
environment
,
but
the
effects
of
chronic
antidepressant
treatment
on
spontaneous
locomotor
activity
in
novel
and
familiar
environments
are
less
well
characterized
.

Because
norepinephrine
is
an
important
regulator
of
spontaneous
locomotor
activity
,
we
speculated
that
norepinephrine
transporter
blockade
contributes
to
the
effects
of
some
antidepressants
on
spontaneous
locomotor
activity
.

METHODS
:
Antidepressant
drugs
(
reboxetine
,
desipramine
,
imipramine
,
venlafaxine
,
bupropion
)
were
administered
acutely
(
intraperitoneal
)
or
chronically
(
via
osmotic
minipump
)
to
control
and
norepinephrine
transporter
knockout
mice
,
and
spontaneous
locomotor
activity
in
novel
or
familiar
environments
was
recorded
.

RESULTS
:
Acute
treatment
with
most
norepinephrine
transporter
-
blocking
antidepressants
decreased
spontaneous
locomotor
activity
in
a
novel
environment
,
whereas
chronic
treatment
decreased
spontaneous
locomotor
activity
in
both
novel
and
familiar
environments
.

The
exception
was
bupropion
,
a
dual
norepinephrine
transporter
/
dopamine
transporter
blocker
,
which
tended
to
increase
spontaneous
locomotor
activity
.

Coadministration
of
reboxetine
and
the
dopamine
transporter
blocker
GBR
12909
also
increased
spontaneous
locomotor
activity
.

Norepinephrine
transporter
knockout
mice
had
low
basal
spontaneous
locomotor
activity
,
which
was
increased
by
bupropion
,
whereas
reboxetine
had
no
effect
in
norepinephrine
transporter
knockout
mice
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
Acute
or
chronic
inactivation
of
the
norepinephrine
transporter
decreases
spontaneous
locomotor
activity
in
novel
and
familiar
environments
unless
coupled
with
dopamine
transporter
blockade
.

Treatment
of
Postmenopausal
Breast
Cancer
with
Selective
Estrogen
Receptor
Modulators
(
SERMs
)
.

Endocrine
therapy
that
targets
the
estrogen
receptor
(
ER
)
is
a
standard
of
care
for
the
treatment
of
postmenopausal
women
with
ER
-
positive
breast
cancer
.

The
selective
ER
modulator
(
SERM
)
tamoxifen
has
been
in
use
for
the
treatment
of
advanced
breast
cancer
for
more
than
30
years
and
is
currently
a
treatment
option
for
all
stages
of
ER
-
positive
disease
.

Tamoxifen
blocks
the
action
of
estrogen
by
binding
to
the
ER
,
and
possesses
both
ER
-
agonist
and
antagonist
properties
.

Unfortunately
,
long
-
term
use
of
tamoxifen
is
associated
with
several
important
concerns
including
an
increased
risk
of
endometrial
cancer
and
thromboembolic
complications
.

In
addition
,
many
patients
who
initially
respond
to
tamoxifen
eventually
relapse
with
resistant
disease
.

New
treatment
approaches
are
therefore
required
.

A
number
of
alternative
SERMs
have
been
tested
as
substitutes
for
tamoxifen
.

These
include
;
toremifene
,
droloxifene
,
idoxifene
,
and
keoxifene
.

Unfortunately
,
the
SERMs
have
not
proved
to
be
more
effective
than
tamoxifen
for
the
treatment
of
advanced
breast
cancer
and
have
shown
a
high
level
of
cross
-
resistance
with
tamoxifen
.

The
subsequent
development
of
the
aromatase
inhibitors
(
AIs
)
is
an
important
therapeutic
advance
by
creating
a
"
no
estrogen
"
environment
.

Another
approach
is
the
development
of
pure
antiestrogens
.

Fulvestrant
is
a
novel
ER
antagonist
that
destroys
the
ER
and
its
signaling
pathway
and
is
not
associated
with
tamoxifen
-
like
agonist
effects
.

It
produces
high
response
rates
compared
with
other
SERMs
and
is
not
cross
-
resistant
to
tamoxifen
or
aromatase
inhibitors
and
is
equally
as
effective
as
the
AI
anastrozole
in
the
treatment
of
postmenopausal
women
with
advanced
breast
cancer
who
have
progressed
on
prior
adjuvant
tamoxifen
therapy
.

This
review
article
discusses
the
significant
and
continuing
value
of
SERMs
for
the
treatment
of
postmenopausal
ER
-
positive
breast
cancer
.

A

segment
in
phosphodiesterase
-

provides
for
high
vardenafil
potency
over
sildenafil
and
tadalafil
and
is
involved
in
phosphodiesterase
-

dimerization
.

Phosphodiesterase
-
5
(
PDE5
)
contains
a
catalytic
domain
(
C
domain
)
that
hydrolyzes
cGMP
and
a
regulatory
domain
(
R
domain
)
that
contains
two

binding
phosphodiesterase
,
Anabaena
adenylyl
cyclases
,
Escherichia

FhlAs
(
GAFs
)
(
A
and
B
)
and
a
phosphorylation
site
for
cyclic
nucleotide
-
dependent
protein
kinases
(
cNPKs
)
.

Binding
of
cGMP
to
GAF
-
A
increases
cNPK
phosphorylation
of
PDE5
and
improves
catalytic
site
affinity
for
cGMP
or
inhibitors
.

GAF

contributes
to
dimerization
of
PDE5
,
inhibition
of
cGMP
binding
to
GAF

A
,
and
sequestration
of
the
phosphorylation
site
.

To
probe
potential
PDE5
R
domain
effects
on
catalytic
site
affinity
for
certain
inhibitors
,
four
N
-
terminal
truncation
mutants
were
generated
:
PDE5Delta1
-
321
contained
GAF
-
B
domain
,
C
domain
,
and
the
sequence
between
GAF
-
A
and
-
B
;
PDE5Delta1
-
419
contained
GAF
-
B
and
C
domain
;
PDE5Delta1
-
465
contained
the
C
domain
and
the
C
-
terminal
portion
of
GAF
-
B
;
and
PDE5Delta1
-
534
contained
only
C
domain
.

Truncated
proteins
with
a
complete
GAF
-
B
were
dimers
,
but
those
lacking
the
N
-
terminal
46
amino
acids
of
GAF
-
B
were
monomers
,
indicating
that
these
residues
are
vital
for
GAF
-
B
-
mediated
PDE5
dimerization
.

K
(
m
)
values
of
the
mutants
for
cGMP
were
similar
to
that
of
full
-
length
PDE5
.

All
PDE5
constructs
had
similar
affinities
for
3
-
isobutyl
-
1
-
methylxanthine
,
sildenafil
,
tadalafil
,
and
UK
-
122764
,
but
mutants
containing
a
complete
GAF
-
B
had
7
-
to
18
-
fold
higher
affinity
for
vardenafil
-
based
compounds
compared
with
those
lacking
a
complete
GAF
-
B
.

This
indicated
that
the
N
-
terminal
46
amino
acids
in
GAF
-
B
are
required
for
high
vardenafil
potency
.

This
is
the
first
evidence
that
PDE5
R
domain
,
and
GAF
-
B
in
particular
,
influences
affinity
and
selectivity
of
the
catalytic
site
for
certain
classes
of
inhibitors
.

Telmisartan
downregulates
angiotensin
II
type
1
receptor
through
activation
of
peroxisome
proliferator
-
activated
receptor
gamma
.

OBJECTIVE
:
Telmisartan
,
an
angiotensin
II
type
1
receptor
(
AT1R
)
antagonist
,
was
found
to
have
a
unique
property
:
it
is
a
partial
agonist
of
peroxisome
proliferator
-
activated
receptor
gamma
(
PPARgamma
)
.

Since
previous
studies
have
demonstrated
that
PPARgamma
activators
suppressed
AT1R
expression
,
we
examined
whether
telmisartan
affects
AT1R
expression
in
vascular
smooth
muscle
cells
.

METHODS
:
Vascular
smooth
muscle
cells
were
derived
from
the
thoracic
aorta
of
Wistar
-
Kyoto
rat
.

Northern
and
Western
blotting
analysis
were
used
to
examine
AT1R
mRNA
and
protein
expression
,
respectively
.

The
DEAE
-
dextran
method
was
used
for
transfection
,
and
the
promoter
activity
of
AT1R
was
examined
by
luciferase
assay
.

RESULTS
:
Telmisartan
decreased
the
expression
of
AT1R
at
the
mRNA
and
protein
levels
in
a
dose
-
and
time
-
dependent
manner
.

Decreased
AT1R
promoter
activity
with
unchanged
mRNA
stability
suggested
that
telmisartan
suppressed
AT1R
gene
expression
at
the
transcriptional
level
.

However
,
the
expression
of
AT1R
was
not
suppressed
by
other
AT1R
antagonists
such
as
candesartan
or
olmesartan
.

Since
the
suppression
of
AT1R
expression
was
prevented
by
pretreatment
with
GW9662
,
a
PPARgamma
antagonist
,
PPARgamma
should
have
participated
in
the
process
.

The
deletion
and
mutation
analysis
of
the
AT1R
gene
promoter
indicated
that
a
GC
box
located
in
the
proximal
promoter
region
is
responsible
for
the
telmisartan
-
induced
downregulation
.

CONCLUSION
:
Our
data
provides
a
novel
insight
into
an
effect
of

:
telmisartan
inhibits

gene
expression
through
PPARgamma
activation
.

The
dual
inhibition
of
angiotensin
II
function
by
telmisartan

AT1R
blockade
and
downregulation
-
would
contribute
to
more
complete
inhibition
of
the
renin

system
.

Secretion
of
L
-
glutamate
from
osteoclasts
through
transcytosis
.

Osteoclasts
are
involved
in
the
catabolism
of
the
bone
matrix
and
eliminate
the
resulting
degradation
products
through
transcytosis
,
but
the
molecular
mechanism
and
regulation
of
transcytosis
remain
poorly
understood
.

Upon
differentiation
,
osteoclasts
express
vesicular
glutamate
transporter
1
(
VGLUT1
)
,
which
is
essential
for
vesicular
storage
and
subsequent
exocytosis
of
glutamate
in
neurons
.

VGLUT1
is
localized
in
transcytotic
vesicles
and
accumulates
L
-
glutamate
.

Osteoclasts
secrete
L
-
glutamate
and
the
bone
degradation
products
upon
stimulation
with
KCl
or
ATP
in
a
Ca2
+
-
dependent
manner
.

KCl
-
and
ATP
-
dependent
secretion
of
L
-
glutamate
was
absent
in
osteoclasts
prepared
from
VGLUT1
-
/
-
knockout
mice
.

Osteoclasts
express
mGluR8
,
a
class
III
metabotropic
glutamate
receptor
.

Its
stimulation
by
a
specific
agonist
inhibits
secretion
of
L
-
glutamate
and
bone
degradation
products
,
whereas
its
suppression
by
a
specific
antagonist
stimulates
bone
resorption
.

Finally
,
it
was
found
that
VGLUT1
-
/
-
mice
develop
osteoporosis
.

Thus
,
in
bone
-
resorbing
osteoclasts
,
L
-
glutamate
and
bone
degradation
products
are
secreted
through
transcytosis
and
the
released
L
-
glutamate
is
involved
in
autoregulation
of
transcytosis
.

Glutamate
signaling
may
play
an
important
role
in

analogs
.

In
order
to
produce
potent
new
leads
for
anticancer
drugs
,
a
new
series
of
quinazoline
analogs
was
designed
to
resemble
methotrexate

MTX
,

)
structure
features
and
fitted
with
functional
groups
believed
to
enhance
inhibition
of
mammalian
DHFR
activity
.

Molecular
modeling
studies
were
used
to
assess
the
fit
of
these
compounds
within
the
active
site
of
human
DHFR
.

The
synthesized
compounds
were
evaluated
for
their
ability
to
inhibit
mammalian
DHFR
in
vitro
and
for
their
antitumor
activity
in
a
standard
in

tissue
culture
assay
panel
.

Compounds
28
,
30
,
and
31
were
the
most
active
DHFR
inhibitors
with
IC
(
50
)
values
of
0
.
5
,
0
.
4
,
and
0
.
4microM
,
respectively
.

The
most
active
antitumor
agents
in
this
study
were
compounds
19
,
31
,
41
,
and
47
with
median
growth
inhibitory
concentrations
(

.
1
,
23
.
5
,
26
.
7
,
and
9
.
1microM
,
respectively
.

Of
this
series
of
compounds
,
only
compound
31
combined
antitumor
potency
with
potent
DHFR
inhibition
;
the
other
active
antitumor
compounds
(
19
,
41
,
and
47
)
all
had
DHFR
IC
(
50
)
values
above
15microM
,
suggesting
that
they
might
exert
their
antitumor
potency
through
some
other
mode
of
action
.

Alternatively
,
the
compounds
could
differ
significantly
in
uptake
or
concentration
within
mammalian
cells

The

is
suggested
to
mediate

,
develop

Here
,
we
report
that
5

consumed
more
food
in
association
with
decreases
in
levels
of
plasma

expression
compared
with

.

These
alterations
were
also
observed
in
8

.

Restricted

significantly
decreased
hypothalamic

of
the

Moreover
,
restricted

hyperinsulinemia
,
and
hyperglycemia
in
association
with
increases
in

,
suppressed

,
whereas
the

These
findings
suggest
that
the

down
-
regulates
hypothalamic

Gonadotropin
-
releasing
hormone
antagonist
in
the
management
of
prostate
cancer
.

Luteinizing
hormone
-
releasing
hormone
(
LHRH
)
agonist
therapy
to
induce
medical
castration
has
become
the
most
common
form
of
hormonal
therapy
for
advanced
and
metastatic
prostate
cancer
.

When
treatment
is
started
,
LHRH
agonists
initially
stimulate
the
release
of
LH
,
causing
a
surge
in
serum
testosterone
that
can
precipitate
a
"
flare
"
phenomenon
or
worsening
of
disease
,
particularly
in
patients
with
bone
metastatic
disease
.

Gonadotropin
-
releasing
hormone
(
GnRH
)
receptor
antagonism
represents
a
newer
approach
to
medical
castration
.

Abarelix
is
a
pure
GnRH
receptor
antagonist
that
is
devoid
of
any
LHRH
agonist
activity
.

Results
from
1
phase
II
and
3
phase
III
clinical
trials
demonstrate
that
abarelix
produces
medical
castration
more
quickly
and
without
causing
testosterone
surge
,
as
compared
with
LHRH
agonists
with
or
without
a
nonsteroidal
antagonist
.

The
safety
profile
in
terms
of
adverse
events
is
comparable
between
the
2
types
of
treatment
,
but
the
lack
of
testosterone
surge
with
abarelix
might
confer
a
safety
advantage
by
abolishing
the
risk
of
a
disease
flare
.

Diet
and
gene
expression
:
delta
-

and
delta
-
6
desaturases
in
healthy
Chinese
and
European
subjects
.

AIM
:
To
compare
the
composition
of
fatty
acids
(
FAs
)
in
diet
,
and
the
expression
of
delta
-
6
desaturase
(
D6D
)
and
delta
-
5
desaturase
(
D5D
)
genes
in
peripheral
blood
mononuclear
cells
(
PBMCs
)
between
Chinese
and
Europeans
.

METHODS
:
Three
-
day
dietary
records
from
20
subjects
from
Beijing
,
China
(
n
=
10
)
and
Kent
,
UK
(
n
=
10
)
were
analysed
.

Expression
of
PBMC
D6D
and
D5D
genes
of
the
subjects
was
determined
using
RT
-
PCR
.

RESULTS
:
The
dietary
intake
of
Chinese
subjects
contained
less
saturated
fatty
acids
(
SFAs
)
and
monounsaturated
fatty
acids
(
MUFAs
)
,
but
more
essential
fatty
acids
(
EFAs
)
than
that
of
Europeans
.

Levels
of
expression
of
PBMC
D6D
and
D5D
genes
of
Chinese
subjects
were
significantly
lower
than
those
of
Europeans
.

A
significant
positive
correlation
was
found
between
dietary
intake
of
total
SFAs
and
total
MUFAs
and
expression
of
PBMC
D6D
and
D5D
genes
,
but
a
significant
negative
correlation
between
dietary
intake
of
linoleic
acid
(
LA
)
and
alpha
-
linolenic
acid
(
LNA
)
and
the
expression
of
PBMC
D6D
and
D5D
genes
.

CONCLUSION
:
Intake
of
high
SFAs
and
MUFAs
appears
to
increase
expression
of
PBMC
D6D
and
D5D
genes
,
whilst
high
EFAs
intake
appears
to
decrease
expression
of
PBMC
D6D
and
D5D
genes
.

A
follow
-
up
study
of
the
expression
of
D6D
and
D5D
genes
in
Chinese
who
live
in
European
countries
with
high
SFA
and
MUFA
diets
would
be
of
interest
.

The
evolution
of
progesterone
receptor
ligands
.

Progesterone
is
one
of
the
first
nuclear
receptor
hormones
to
be
described
functionally
and
subsequently
approached
as
a
drug
target
.

Because
progesterone
(
1
)
affects
both
menstruation
and
gestation
via
the
progesterone
receptor
(
PR
)
,
research
aimed
at
modulating
its
activity
is
usually
surrounded
by
controversy
.

However
,
ligands
for
PR
were
developed
into
drugs
,
and
their
evolution
can
be
crudely
divided
into
three
periods
:
(
1
)
drug
-
like
steroids
that
mimic
the
gestational
properties
of
progesterone
;
(
2
)
drug
-
like
steroids
with
different
properties
from
progesterone
and
expanded
therapeutic
applications
;
and
(
3
)
non
-
steroidal
PR
ligands
with
improved
selectivity
and
modulator
properties
and
further
expanded
therapeutic
applications
.

Although
the
latter
have
yet
to
see
widespread
clinical
applications
,
their
development
is
founded
on
a
half
century
of
research
,
and
they
represent
the
future
for
this
drug
target
.

Decitabine
-

bedside
to
bench
.

PURPOSE
OF
THE
REVIEW
:
Epigenetic
changes
marked
by
DNA
methylation
are
known
to
contribute
to
the
malignant
transformation
of
cells
by
silencing
critical
genes
.

Decitabine
inhibits
DNA
methyltransferase
and
has
shown
therapeutic
effects
in
patients
with
hematologic
malignancies
.

However
,
the
connection
between
the
clinical
activity
of
decitabine
and
its
demethylating
activity
is
not
clear
.

Herein
,
we
summarize
the
results
of
recent
clinical
trials
of
decitabine
in
hematologic
malignancies
,
and
review
the
translational
research
into
decitabine
'
s
mechanism
of
clinical
activity
.

RECENT
FINDINGS
:
Low
-
dose
decitabine
has
been
studied
recently
in
multiple
clinical
trials
and
has
been
shown
to
be
effective
for
treatment
of
myelodysplastic
syndromes
.

Correlative
laboratory
studies
of
clinical
trials
have
shown
that
decitabine
induces
global
hypomethylation
as
well
as
hypomethylation
of
gene
-
specific
promoters
and
activation
of
gene
expression
.

Past
a
given
threshold
,
induction
of
higher
degrees
of
hypomethylation
is
not
directly
associated
with
a
better
clinical
outcome
.

Moreover
,
studies
have
suggested
that
patients
with
promoter
hypermethylation
of
p15
(
INK4B
)
at
baseline
have
paradoxically
a
lower
chance
of
achieving
response
than
those
without
hypermethylation
.

Furthermore
,
several
other
genes
activated
by
decitabine
were
independent
of
hypomethylation
in
the
promoter
regions
.

CONCLUSION
:
While
at
least
part
of
decitabine
'
s
activity
is
through
induction
of
hypomethylation
and
reactivation
of
critical
genes
,
mechanisms
independent
from
hypomethylation
are
also
important
for
decitabine
'
s
antitumor
activity
.

[
Efalizumab
]
.

Efalizumab
(
Raptiva
,
Serono
)
is
a
humanised
monoclonal
antibody
(
IgG1
)
produced
by
biotechnology
.

This
antibody
has
a
novel
place
among
biotherapies
for
psoriasis
.

It
is
bound
to
the
CD11a
subunit
of
a
surface
molecule
of
the
T
lymphocyte
LFA
-
1
(
Leucocyte
Function
-
associated
Antigen
-
1
)
.

This
molecule
is
essential
for
binding
of
T
lymphocytes
to
the
ICAM
-
1
molecule
(
Intercellular
Adhesion
Molecule
-
1
)
found
on
antigen
-
presenting
cells
,
endothelial
cells
and
keratinocytes
.

Binding
of
efalizumab
to
CD11a
prevents
binding
of
LFA
-
1
to
ICAM
-
1
,
thus
inhibiting
several
steps
in
the
immunological
process
responsible
for
formation
of
psoriatic
plaque
(
activation
of
naive
T
lymphocytes
to
memory
T
lymphocytes
,
lymphocyte
migration
and
reactivation
of
T
lymphocytes
in
skin
)
.

Efalizumab
was
approved
in
the
United
States
by
the
FDA
(
Food
and
Drug
Administration
)
in
2003
for
the
treatment
of
moderate
-
to
-
severe
psoriasis
requiring
systemic
therapy
.

It
may
be
used
as
first
-
line
therapy
in
the
United
States
in
this
indication
.

In
France
,
marketing
authorisation
(
MA
)
was
granted
more
recently
in
September
2005
.

The
indications
are
moderate
-
to
-
severe
cutaneous
plaque
psoriasis
in
adults
in
cases
of
failure
,
intolerance
or
contraindication
of
at
least
two
systemic
treatments
including
phototherapy
,
methotrexate
and
cyclosporine
.

Current
clinical
trial
data
is
available
for
3500
patients
with
plaque
psoriasis
.

A
75
%
improvement
in
PASI
score
was
seen
in
between
22
and
39
%
of
patients
treated
with
efalizumab
(
vs
.
2
to
5
%
for
patients
on
placebo
)
in
a
single
weekly
subcutaneous
injection
(
1
mg
/
kg
)
.

A
study
in
good
responders
confirms
the
continuing
long
-
term
efficacy
of
prescription
of
the
drug
up
to
36
months
(
with
at
least
a
75
%
improvement
in
PASI
score
in
53
%
of
patients
)
.

However
,
it
is
not
effective
against
joint
involvement
in
psoriasis
.

The
most
common
side
-
effects
(
incidence
>
1
/
100
)
are
influenza
-
like
syndrome
,
risk
of
outbreak
of
cutaneous
psoriasis
during
or
after
discontinuation
of
treatment
,
worsening
of
arthralgia
,
minor
hypersensitivity
reactions
,
reversible
changes
in
laboratory
values
(
hyperlymphocytosis
,
elevated
alkaline
phosphatases
and
transaminases
)
.

Because
of
rare
cases
of
thrombocytopenia
(
incidence
<
1
/
100
)
,
reversible
on
discontinuation
of
treatment
,
monthly
monitoring
of
platelet
counts
is
required
over
the
first
3
months
of
therapy
.

There
are
currently
no
randomised
studies
comparing
the
various
systemic
treatments
(
standard
therapy
and
biotherapy
)
for
psoriasis
.

However
,
on
extrapolation
of
the
available
results
concerning
efficacy
(
PASI
-
75
after
12
weeks
of
treatment
)
,
efalizumab
appears
to
be
less
efficacious
than
anti
-
TNF
alpha
agents
.

This
drug
constitutes
an
additional
treatment
option
and
its
position
in
the
therapeutic
arsenal
will
depend
upon
its
long
-
term
benefit
/
risk
ratio
in
relation
to
other
biotherapies
.

Multiple
pathways
for
cationic
amino

transport
in
rat
seminiferous
tubule
cells
.

Arginine
and
ornithine
are
known
to
be
important
for
various
biological
processes
in
the
testis
,
but
the
delivery
of
extracellular
cationic
amino
acids
to
the
seminiferous
tubule
cells
remains
poorly
understood
.

We
investigated
the
activity
and
expression
of
cationic
amino
acid
transporters
in
isolated
rat
Sertoli
cells
,
peritubular
cells
,
pachytene
spermatocytes
,
and
early
spermatids
.

We
assessed
the
l
-
arginine
uptake
kinetics
,
Na
(
+
)
dependence
of
transport
,
profiles
of
cis
inhibition
of
uptake
by
cationic
and
neutral
amino
acids
,
and
sensitivity
to
trans
stimulation
of
cationic
amino
acid
transporters
,
and
studied
the
expression
of
the
genes
encoding
them
by
RT
-
PCR
.

Our
data
suggest
that
l

arginine
is
taken
up
by
Sertoli
cells
and
peritubular
cells
,
principally
via
system
y
(

,
with

By

Sertoli
cells
had
higher
rates
of
l

arginine
transport
than
the
other
seminiferous
tubule
cells
.

This
high
efficiency
of
arginine
transport
in
Sertoli
cells
and
the
properties
of
the
y

)
L
system
predominating
in
these
cells
strongly
suggest
that
Sertoli
cells
play
a
key
role
in
supplying
germ
cells
with
l

and
other
cationic
amino
acids
.

Furthermore
,
whereas
cytokines
induce
nitric
oxide
(
NO

production
in
peritubular
and
Sertoli
cells
,
little
or
no
upregulation
of
arginine
transport
by
cytokines
was
observed
in
these
cells
.

Thus
,
NO
synthesis
does
not
depend
on
the
stimulation
of

Sequestration
of
retinyl
esters
is
essential
for
retinoid
signaling
in
the
zebrafish
embryo
.

For
vertebrate
development
,
vitamin
A
(
all
-
trans
retinol
)
is
required
in
quantitative
different
amounts
and
spatiotemporal
distribution
for
the
production
of
retinoic
acid
,
a
nuclear
hormone
receptor
ligand
,
and
11
-
cis
retinal
,
the
chromophore
of
visual
pigments
.

We
show
here
for
zebrafish
that
embryonic
retinoid
homeostasis
essentially
depends
on
the
activity
of
a
leci
-
thin
:
retinol
acyltransferase
(
Lratb
)
.

During
embryogenesis
,
lratb
is
expressed
in
mostly
non
-
overlapping
domains
opposite
to
retinal
dehydrogenase
2
(
raldh2
)
,
the
key
enzyme
for
retinoic
acid
synthesis
.

Blocking
retinyl
ester
formation
by
a
targeted
knock
down
of
Lratb
results
in
significantly
increased
retinoic
acid
levels
,
which
lead
to
severe
embryonic
patterning
defects
.

Thus
,
we
provide
evidence
that
a
balanced
competition
between
Lratb
and
Raldh2
for
yolk
vitamin
A
defines
embryonic
compartments
either
for
retinyl
ester
or
retinoic
acid
synthesis
.

This
homeostatic
mechanism
dynamically
adjusts
embryonic
retinoic
acid
levels
for
gene
regulation
,
concomitantly
sequestering
excess
yolk
vitamin
A
in
the
form
of
retinyl

for
the
establishment
of

vision
later
during

Ehlers

is
a

disease
involving
primarily
the
skin

.

The
main
feature
of

is

are

.

A

with
a
typical
clinical
presentation
and
molecular
diagnosis
of

Sequencing
of

revealed
a

Molecular
modeling
of
purinergic
receptor
P2Y12
and
interaction
with
its
antagonists
.

Purinergic
receptors
are
a
class
of
cell
surface
receptors
for
purines
that
prefer
ATP
or
ADP
over
adenosine
.

The
surface
receptors
for
extracellular
nucleotides
are
called
P2
receptors
.

They
are
activated
by
both
pyrimidine
and
purine
nucleotides
.

ADP
initiates
platelet
aggregation
by
'
simultaneous
activation
of
two
G
protein
-
coupled
receptors
,
P2Y1
and
P2Y12
.

P2Y12
has
been
shown
to
be
the
target
of
the
thienopyridine
drugs
,
ticlopidine
and
clopidogrel
.

Here
,
the
active
sites
of
P2Y12
for
ATP
as
well
as
ADP
are
predicted
by
bioinformatics
and
molecular
modeling
.

First
,
the
three
-
dimensional
(
3D
)
structure
of
P2Y12
was
constructed
by
InsightII
/
Homology
module
using
the
corresponding
bovine
rhodopsin
(
PDB
code
:
1HZX
)
as
the
template
.

Then
the
primary
structures
were
optimized
by
energy
minimization
that
has
been
successfully
accepted
by
the
Protein
Data
Bank
(
PDB
code
:
1VZ1
)
.

Second
,
a
simple
scoring
matrix
was
built
up
based
on
the
analysis
of
13
known
ATP
-
binding
proteins
.

And
the
most
probable
active
sites
of
P2Y12
were
predicted
using
the
scoring
matrix
,
which
include
three
distant
areas
:
"
head
area
"
(
LGTGPLRTFV
,
87
-
96
)
,
"
middle
area
"
(
VGLITNGLAM
,
38
-
47
,
and
LGAKILSVVI
,
139
-
148
)
,
and
"
bottom
area
"
(
RTRGVGKVPR
,
222
-
231
)
.

Subsequently
the
structural
model
of
P2Y12
was
docked
with
ATP
/
ADP
in
comparison
with
P2Y1
(
PDB
code
1ddd
)
.

As
a
comparison
,
we
docked
its
antagonists
,
such
as
ticlopidine
and
clopidogrel
,
to
the
most
probable
sites
and
calculated
their
intermolecular
energy
.

Our
results
imply
that
P2Y12
has
the
potential
to
be
inhibited
by
ADP
/
ATP
analogs
,
and
it
suggests
that
P2Y12
acts
as
a
target
of
new
drugs
that
inhibit
platelet
aggregation
.

Cadmium
induces
mitogenic
signaling
in
breast
cancer
cell
by
an
ERalpha
-
dependent
mechanism
.

Breast
cancer
(
BC
)
is
linked
to
estrogen
exposure
.

Estradiol
(
E2
)
stimulates
BC
cells
proliferation
by
binding
the
estrogen
receptor
(
ER
)
.

Hormone
-

cancers
have
been
linked
to

environmental
contaminants
.

Cadmium
(
Cd
)

toxic
pollutant
,
acts
as
estrogens
in
BC
cells
.

Purpose
of
our
study
was
to
evaluate
whether
Cd
regulates
MCF
-
7
cell
proliferation
by
activating
ERK1
/
2
,
Akt
and
PDGFRalpha
kinases
.

Cd
increased
cell
proliferation
and
the
ER
-
antagonist
ICI
182
,
780
blunted
it
.

To
characterize
an
ER
-
dependent
mechanism
,
ERalpha
/
beta
expression
was
evaluated
.

Cd
decreased
ERalpha
expression
,
but
not
ERbeta
.

Cd
also
increased
ERK1
/
2
,
Akt
and
PDGFRalpha
phosphorylation
while
ICI
blocked
it
.

Since
stimulation
of
phosphorylation
was
slower
than
expected
,
c
-
fos
and
c
-
jun
proto
-
oncogenes
,
and
PDGFA
were
analyzed
.

Cd
rapidly
increased
c

jun
,
c
-
fos
and
PDGFA
expression
.

Cells
were
also
co
-
incubated
with
the
Cd
and
specific
kinases
inhibitors
,
which
blocked
the
Cd
-
stimulated
proliferation
.

In
conclusion
,
our
results
indicate
that
Cd
increases
BC
cell
proliferation
in
vitro
by
stimulating
Akt
,
ERK1
/
2
and
PDGFRalpha
kinases
activity
likely
by
activating
c

and
PDGFA
by
an

Gonadotropin
-
releasing
hormone
functionally
antagonizes
testosterone
activation
of
the
human
androgen
receptor
in
prostate
cells
through
focal
adhesion
complexes
involving
Hic
-
5
.

Gonadotropin
-
releasing
hormone
(
GnRH
)
analogs
constitute
the
most
widely
employed
medical
treatment
for
prostatic
cancer
.

The
predominant
mechanism
of
action
is
presumed
to
be
via
the
inhibition
of
gonadotropins
and
resultant
decrease
in
androgen
.

However
,
GnRH
analogs
have
also
been
shown
to
directly
inhibit
prostate
cancer
cells
both
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
through
antiproliferative
cell
cycle
arrest
and
stimulation
of
apoptosis
.

Since
the
GnRH
receptor
has
been
shown
to
affect
sex
steroid
hormone
receptor
function
,
we
considered
that
part
of
GnRH
analog
actions
on
prostate
cells
may
be
mediated
through
modulation
of
the
human
androgen
receptor
.

Using
a
model
HEK293
cell
line
expressing
the
GnRH
receptor
,
we
demonstrated
a
novel
signalling
pathway
of
the
GnRH
receptor
that
induces
nuclear
translocation
of
the
androgen
receptor
that
renders
it
transcriptionally
inactive
.

This
mechanism
involves
the
calcium
-
dependent
tyrosine
kinase
Pyk2
,
the
non
-
receptor
tyrosine
kinase
c
-
Src
and
the
focal
adhesion
protein
/
steroid
receptor
co
-
factor
,
Hic
-
5
.

In
this
setting
there
is
a
GnRH
-
induced
association
and
nuclear
translocation
of
the
androgen
receptor
with
Hic
-
5
.

GnRH
-
induced
Pyk2
activation
opposed
the
association
of
Hic
-
5
with
androgen
receptor
as
overexpression
of
a
dominant
negative
Pyk2
enhanced
the
GnRH
-
induced
nuclear
translocation
of
a
green
fluorescent
protein
-
tagged
human
androgen
receptor
.

GnRH
-
induced
c
-
Src
activation
resulted
in
the
phosphorylation
of
expressed
Hic
-
5
and
promoted
its
association
with
the
human
androgen
receptor
.

In
contrast
to
testosterone
,
GnRH
-
induced
nuclear
translocation
did
not
transcriptionally
activate
the
androgen
receptor
.

We
then
demonstrated
that
GnRH
can
also
stimulate
androgen
receptor
mobilization
in
human
prostate
PC3
,
BPH
-
1
and
LNCaP
cells
,
and
in
cultured
rat
ventral
prostate
cells
through
the
same
mechanism
.

To
determine
if
GnRH
could
antagonize
androgen
effects
in
normal
tissue
,
we
examined
the
effect
of
GnRH
on
rat
ventral
prostate
organ
cultures
and
demonstrated
that
GnRH
can
functionally
antagonize
the
actions
of
testosterone
on
prostate
cell
proliferation
and
tissue
growth
.

This
antagonism
of
testosterone
action
by
GnRH
may
underlie
in
part
the
capacity
of
GnRH
receptor
activation
to
inhibit
prostate
tumor
growth
.

Trace

displays
species

dependent
stereoselectivity
for
isomers
of

,

,
and

.

The
synthetic
amines
methamphetamine
(
METH
)
,
amphetamine
(
AMPH
)
,
and
their
metabolite
para
-
hydroxyamphetamine
(
POHA
)
are
chemically
and
structurally
related
to
the
catecholamine
neurotransmitters
and
a
small
group
of
endogenous
biogenic
amines
collectively
referred
to
as
the
trace
amines
(
TAs
)
.

Recently
,
it
was
reported
that
METH
,
AMPH
,
POHA
,
and
the
TAs
para
-
tyramine
(
TYR
)
and
beta
-
phenylethylamine
(
PEA
)
stimulate
cAMP
production
in

kidney
(
HEK
)
-
293
cells
expressing
rat
trace
amine
-
associated
receptor
1
(
rTAAR1
)
.

The
discovery
that
METH
and
AMPH
activate
the
rTAAR1
motivated
us
to
study
the
effect
of
these
drugs
on
the
mouse
TAAR1
(
mTAAR1
)
and
a
human
-
rat
chimera
(
hrChTAAR1
)
.

Furthermore
,
because
S
-
(
+
)
-
isomers
of
METH
and
AMPH
are
reported
to
be
more
potent
and
efficacious
in
vivo
than
R
-
(
-
)
,
we
determined
the
enantiomeric
selectivity
of
all
three
species
of
TAAR1
.

In
response
to
METH
,
AMPH
,
or
POHA
exposure
,
the
accumulation
of
cAMP
by
HEK
-
293
cells
stably
expressing
different
species
of
TAAR1
was
concentration
-
and
isomer
-
dependent
.

EC50
values
for
S

)
-
METH
were
0
.
89
,
0

92
,
and
4
.
44
microM
for
rTAAR1
,
mTAAR1
,
and
h
-
rChTAAR1
,
respectively
.

PEA
was
a
potent
and
full
agonist
at
each
species
of
TAAR1
,
whereas
TYR
was
a
full
agonist
for
the
rodent
TAAR1s
but
was
a
partial
agonist
at
h
-
rChTAAR1
.

Interestingly
,
both
isomers
of
METH
were
full
agonists
at
mTAAR1
and
h
-
rChTAAR1
,
whereas
both
were
partial
agonists
at
rTAAR1
.

Taken
together
,
these
in

results
suggest
that
,
in
vivo
,
TAAR1
could
be
a
novel
mediator
of
the
effects
of
these
drugs
.

:
Epithelium

interactions
play
a
major
role
in
pancreas
development
.

Recently
,
we
demonstrated
that
embryonic
pancreatic
mesenchyme
enhanced
progenitor
cell
proliferation
but
inhibited
endocrine
cell
differentiation
.

Here
,
we
investigated
the
role
played
by
sulphated
proteoglycans
,
which
are
known
to
be
essential
to
embryonic
development
,
in
this
inhibitory
effect
.

MATERIALS
AND
METHODS
:
We
first
determined
the
expression
of
the
genes
encoding
glypicans
,

and
the
main

rat

.

Next
,
using
an
in

model
of
pancreas
development
,
we
blocked
the
action
of
endogenous
sulphated
proteoglycans
by
treating
embryonic
pancreases
in
culture
with
chlorate
,
an
inhibitor
of
proteoglycan
sulphation
,
and
examined
the
effects
on
pancreatic
endocrine
cell
differentiation
.

RESULTS
:
We
first
showed
that
expression
of
the
genes
encoding
glypicans
1
,
2
,
3
and
5
and
heparan
sulphate

decreased
between
E13

and
E17

.

We
next
found
that
alteration
of
proteoglycan
action
by
chlorate
blocked
the
inhibitory
effect
of
the
mesenchyme
on
endocrine
differentiation
.

We

could
be
useful
in
the

The

a

order
of

as
the
ubiquitous
isoform
CA

or
the

CA

.

A
series
of
sulfonamides
and
one
sulfamate
have
been
tested
for
their
interaction
with
this
isozyme
.

Simple
benzenesulfonamides
were
rather
ineffective
hCA
VI
inhibitors
,
with
inhibition
constants
in
the
range
of
1090
-
6680
nM
.

Better
inhibitors
were
detected
among
such
derivatives
bearing
2

4
-
aminomethyl

-
hydroxymethyl

or
among
halogenated

(

nM
)
.

Some
clinically
used
compounds
,
such
as
acetazolamide
,
methazolamide
,
ethoxzolamide
,
dichlorophenamide
,
dorzolamide
,

showed
effective

,
with

The
best
inhibitors
were
brinzolamide
and
sulpiride
(

9
nM
)
,
the
latter

being
also
a

inhibitor
.

The
metallic
taste
reported
as
a
side
effect
after
the
treatment
with
systemic
sulfonamides
may
be
due
to
the
inhibition
of
the

.

Some
of
the
compounds
investigated
in
this
study
might
be
used
as
additives
in
toothpastes
for
reducing
the
acidification
produced
by
the
relevant
CO2
hydrase
activity
of
enamel

,
which
leads
to
the

Role
of
the
calcium
modulated
cyclases
in
the
development
of
the
retinal
projections
.

Transmembrane
isoforms
of
adenylate
cyclases
(
AC
)
integrate
a
wide
variety
of
extracellular
signals
from
neurotransmitters
to
morphogens
and
can
also
regulate
cAMP
production
in
response
to
calcium
entry
.

Based
on
observations
in
the
barrelless
mouse
strain
,
the
Adcy1
gene
(
AC1
)
was
involved
in
the
segregation
of
binocular
retinal
inputs
.

To
determine
the
potential
role
of
other
AC
isoforms
we
localized
the
Adcy
genes
in
the
visual
centres
during
development
,
using
in
situ
hybridization
.

Six
different
AC
subtypes
were
found
in
the
developing
retinal
ganglion
cell
layer
(
RGC
;
AC1
,
AC2
,
AC3
,
AC5
,
AC8
,
and
AC9
)
,
and
three
AC
subtypes
were
expressed
in
the
central
brain
targets
,
the
dorsal
lateral
geniculate
nucleus
(
AC1
and
AC8
)
,
the
ventral
lateral
geniculate
nucleus
(
AC2
and
AC8
)
and
the
superior
colliculus
(
AC1
,
AC2
,
AC8
)
.

Using
a
genetic
approach
we
tested
the
role
of
the
calcium
modulated
cyclases
AC1
,
AC5
and
AC8
for
the
segregation
retinal
fibres
.

Ipsilateral
retinal
axons
remained
exuberant
in
the
AC1
(
-
/
-
)
mice
,
with
overlapping
retinal
projections
from
both
eyes
in
the
superior
colliculus
and
the
visual
thalamus
.

These
abnormalities
were
similar
to
those
of
barrelless
mouse
mutants
.

No
abnormalities
were
detectable
in
the
AC5
(
-
/
-
)
or
the
AC8
(
-
/
-
)
mice
.

Similar
abnormalities
were
noted
in
the
single
AC1
(
-
/
-
)
and
the
AC1
/
AC8
double
-
knockout
mice
(
DKO
)
.

Thus
,
only
AC1
is
required
for
the
maturation
of
the
retinal
axon
terminals
whereas
AC5
and
AC8
are
not
needed
.

The
specificity
of
AC1
'
s
action
is
linked
to
its
cellular
localization
in
the
RGCs
and
to
its
distinctive
functional
profile
,
compared
with
the
other
cyclases
expressed
in
the
same
cells
.

Pirfenidone
inhibits
TGF
-
beta
expression
in
malignant
glioma
cells
.

Due
to
its
immunosuppressive
properties
,
the
cytokine
transforming
growth
factor
(
TGF
)
-
beta
has
become
a
promising
target
in
the
experimental
treatment
of
human
malignant
gliomas
.

Here
,
we
report
that
the
antifibrotic
drug
5
-
methyl
-
1
-
phenyl
-
2
-
(
1H
)
-
pyridone
(

,
PFD
)
elicits
growth
-
inhibitory
effects
and
reduces
TGF
-
beta2
protein
levels
in
human
glioma
cell
lines
.

This
reduction
in
TGF
-
beta2
is
biologically
relevant
since
PFD
treatment
reduces
the
growth
inhibition
of
TGF
-
beta
-
sensitive
CCL
-

cells
mediated
by
conditioned
media
of

Inhibition
of
monoamine
oxidase
type
A
,
but
not
type
B
,
is
an
effective
means
of
inducing
anticonvulsant
activity
in
the
kindling
model
of
epilepsy
.

The
anticonvulsant
activity
of
inhibitors
of
monoamine
oxidase
(
MAO
)
was
reported
early
after
the
development
of
irreversible
MAO
inhibitors
such
as
tranylcypromine
,
but
was
never
clinically
used
because
of
the
adverse
effects
of
these
compounds
.

The
more
recently
developed
reversible
MAO
inhibitors
with
selectivity
for
either
the
MAO
-
A
or
MAO
-
B
isoenzyme
forms
have
not
been
studied
extensively
in
animal
models
of
epilepsy
,
so
it
is
not
known
which
type
of
MAO
inhibitor
is
particularly
effective
in
this
respect
.

We
compared
the
following
drugs
in
the
kindling
model
of
epilepsy
:
1
)
L
-
deprenyl
(
selegiline
)
,
i
.
e
.
,
an
irreversible
inhibitor
of
MAO
-
B
,
which
,
however
,
also
inhibits
MAO
-
A
at
higher
doses
,
2
)
the
novel
reversible
MAO
-
B
inhibitor
LU
53439
(

,

-
dimethyl

-
(

-
isopropyl

1
,
3
,
4
-
thiadiazol
-
5
-
yl
)
-
methoxy
-
coumarin
)
,
which
is
much
more
selective
for
MAO
-
B
than
L
-
deprenyl
,
3
)
the
novel
reversible
and
highly
selective
MAO
-
A
inhibitor
LU
43839
(
esuprone
;
7
-
hydroxy
-
3
,
4
-
dimethylcoumarin
ethanesulfonate
)
,
and
4
)
the
irreversible
nonselective
MAO
inhibitor
tranylcypromine
.

Esuprone
proved
to
be
an
effective
anticonvulsant
in
the
kindling
model
with
a
similar
potency
as
L
-
deprenyl
.

In
contrast
to
esuprone
and
L
-
deprenyl
,
the
selective
MAO
-
B
inhibitor
LU
53439
was
not
effective
in
the
kindling
model
;
this
substantiates
the
previous
notion
that
the
anticonvulsant
activity
of
L
-
deprenyl
is
not
related
to
MAO
-
B
inhibition
,
but
to
other
effects
of
this
drug
,
such
as
inhibition
of
MAO
-
A
.

Drugs
inhibiting
both
MAO
-
A
and
MAO
-
B
to
a
similar
extent
(
tranylcypromine
)
or
combinations
of
selective
MAO
-
A
and
MAO
-
B
inhibitors
(
esuprone
plus
LU
53439
)
had
no
advantage
over
MAO
-
A
inhibition
alone
,
but
were
less
well
tolerated
.

The
data
thus
suggest
that
selective
MAO
-
A
inhibitors
such
as
esuprone
may
be
an
interesting
new
approach
for
the
treatment
of
epilepsy
.

Effects
of
mCPP
on
the
extracellular
concentrations
of
serotonin
and
dopamine
in
rat
brain
.

Intravenous
administration
of
m
-
chloro
-
phenylpiperazine
(
mCPP
)
(
0
.
25
or
2
.
5
mg
/
kg
)
induced
a
marked
and
dose
-
related
increase
in
extracellular
concentrations
of
serotonin
in
hippocampus
(
300
-
1
,
400
%
of
baseline
)
as
measured
using
in
vivo
microdialysis
in
awake
male
Wistar
rats
of
the
spontaneously
hypertensive
(
SH
)
strain
.

Indicating
that
the
effect
of
mCPP
was
caused
by
a
reversal
of
the
serotonin
transporter
,
it
was
antagonized
by
pretreatment
with
the
serotonin
re
-
uptake
inhibitor
citalopram
(
10
mg
/
kg
)
but
was
unaffected
by
local
administration
of
the
sodium
channel
blocker
tetrodotoxin
(
TTX
;
1
microns
)
.

mCPP
was
also
shown
to
induce
an
increase
in
extracellular
concentrations
of
dopamine
in
the
nucleus
accumbens
and
the
striatum
of
SH
rats
and
in
the
nucleus
accumbens
of
rats
of
the
Sprague
-
Dawley
(
SD
)
strain
;
this
effect
of
mCPP
was
,
however
,
much
weaker
(
125
-
170
%
of
baseline
)
than
the
effect
on
serotonin
;
moreover
,
it
seems
to
be
TTX
-
sensitive
.

In
anesthetized
SD
rats
,
mCPP
induced
a
moderate
reduction
of
nigral
dopamine
cell
firing
rate
;
supporting
the
assumption
that
this
effect
is
secondary
to
the
observed
increase
in
dopamine
release
,
it
was
blocked
by
pretreatment
either
with
the
dopamine
synthesis
inhibitor
alpha
-
methyl
-
para
-
tyrosine
or
with
the
dopamine
D2
receptor
antagonist
haloperidol
.

In
conclusion
,
the
results
suggest
that
mCPP
induces
a
marked
,
TTX
-
insensitive
increase
in
serotonin
release
in
rat
brain
,
but
only
a
modest
and
TTX
-
sensitive
increase
in
the
extracellular
levels
of
dopamine
.

Participation
of
beta

adrenergic
receptors
on

in
modulation
of
LPS

induced
cytokine
release
.

For
several
years
it
is
known
that
beta
-
adrenergic
receptor
agonists
have
anti
-
inflammatory
effects
.

However
,
little
is
known
about
the
role
of
beta
-
adrenergic
receptors
on
macrophages
in
the
modulation
of
cytokine
production
by
beta
-
agonists
during
inflammation
.

In
this
study
,
the
presence
of
beta
-
receptors
on
PMA
-
differentiated
U937
human
macrophages
,
and
the
participation
of
these
receptors
in
the
modulation
of
LPS
-
mediated
cytokine
production
by
beta
-
agonists
was
investigated
.

Total
beta
-
receptor
expression
on
undifferentiated
(
monocyte
)
and
PMA
-
differentiated
U937
cells
was
established
using
receptor
binding
studies
on
membrane
fractions
with
a
radio
ligand
.

The
expression
of
beta
-
receptors
proved
to
be
significantly
lower
on
monocytes
than
on
macrophages
,
additionally
a
predominant
expression
of
beta
2
-
receptors
was
found
.

Production

TNF

alpha
,
IL
-
6
,
and
IL
-

by
LPS

stimulated
differentiated
U937
cells
was
measured
in
time
.

Peak
concentrations
for
TNF

alpha
,
IL
-
6
and
IL
-
10
occurred
at
3
,
12
and
9
hrs
,
respectively
.

When
differentiated
U937
cells
were
incubated
with
both
LPS
and
the
beta
-
agonist
clenbuterol
the
production
of
TNF
-
alpha
and
IL
-
6
was
significantly
reduced
.

However
the
production
of
IL
-
10
was
increased
.

To
study
the
mechanism
of
modulation
of
cytokine
production
in
more
detail
,
U937
macrophages
were
incubated
with
LPS
/
clenbuterol
in
combination
with
selective
beta
1
-
and
beta
2
-
antagonists
.

These
results
indicated
that
the
beta
2
-
and
not
the
beta
1
-
receptor
is
involved
in
the
anti
-
inflammatory
activity
of
clenbuterol
.

The

demonstrated
that
,
analogous
to

estramustine
could
not
induce
luciferase
activity
in
either
w

In

a

was
observed
.

Exposure
of
LNCaP
cells
to
estramustine
for
24

caused
transcriptional

The

resulted
in

of

,
suggesting
that

Our

The

highlight
two

These

show
clearly
that

Static
Laue
diffraction
studies
on
acetylcholinesterase
.

Acetylcholinesterase
(
AChE
)
is
one
of
nature
'
s
fastest
enzymes
,
despite
the
fact
that
its
three
-
dimensional
structure
reveals
its
active
site
to
be
deeply
sequestered
within
the
molecule
.

This
raises
questions
with
respect
to
traffic
of
substrate
to
,
and
products
from
,
the
active
site
,
which
may
be
investigated
by
time

resolved
crystallography
.

In
order
to
address
one
aspect
of
the
feasibility
of
performing
time
-
resolved
studies
on
AChE
,
a
data
set
has
been
collected
using
the

technique
on
a

,
which
are
of
surprisingly
good
quality
compared
with
similar
maps
from

,
show
essentially
the

features
.

They
clearly
reveal
the

YAP1
confers
resistance
to
the
fatty
acid
synthase
inhibitor
cerulenin
through
the
transporter
Flr1p
in
Saccharomyces
cerevisiae
.

In
this
study
,
we
utilized
a
genetic
approach
to
identify
genes
which
render
yeast
cells
resistant
to
cerulenin
(
Cer
)
,
a
potent
and
noncompetitive
inhibitor
of
fatty
acid
synthase
(
FAS
)
.

Overexpression
of
the
yeast
transcription
factor
Yap1p
was
found
to
confer
Cer
resistance
(
CerR
)
.

This
resistance
was
shown
to
be
less
pronounced
in
a
strain
deleted
for
YCF1
,
a
multidrug
resistance
ABC
transporter
,
supporting
previous
observations
that
implicated
YCF1
in
mediating
CerR
.

However
,
isolation
of
YAP1
as
a
high
-
copy
CerR
gene
in
a
ycf1delta
strain
suggested
that
YAP1
-
induced
CerR
was
mediated
by
additional
downstream
effectors
.

Overexpression
of
neither
glutathione
reductase
nor
a
predicted
aryl
alcohol
dehydrogenase
(
the
products
of
two
YAP1
-
regulated
genes
involved
in
detoxification
)
conferred
CerR
.

Overexpression
of
ATR1
,
another
YAP1
-
regulated
gene
previously
implicated
in
conferring
resistance
to
a
number
of
cytotoxic
drugs
,
was
also
incapable
of
making
cells
resistant
to
Cer
.

In
contrast
,
overexpression
of
Flr1p
,
a
yeast
transporter
of
the
major
facilitator
superfamily
which
is
also
under
the
control
of
YAP1
,
was
sufficient
to
confer
CerR
in
an
otherwise
wild
-
type
background
.

Moreover
,
CerR
was
markedly
diminished
in
a
strain
deleted
for
FLR1
.

These
findings
implicate
members
of
both
of
the
transporter
superfamilies
involved
in
multiple
drug
resistance
(
MDR
)
in
the
acquisition
of
CerR
in
yeast
.

Furthermore
,
our
studies
indicate
that
yeast
may
be
a
useful
model
system
in
which
to
investigate
the
role
of
FAS
in
cancer
biology
and
the
effects
of
Cer
on
eukaryotic
cell
growth
.

Mortality

in
men
is
associated
with
a
common
mutation
in
the
methylene

tetrahydrofolate

gene
(
MTHFR
)
.

An
elevated
level
of
homocysteine
in
plasma
is
associated
with
the
occurrence
of
cardiovascular
disease
.

A
common
ala
-
to
-
val
mutation
in
the
methylenetetrahydrofolate
reductase
gene
(
MTHFR
)
is
associated
with
an
elevated
level
of
plasma
homocysteine
.

We
studied
the
possible
detrimental
effects
of
the
MTHFR
mutation
on
mortality
.

Within
a
population
-
based
study
in
the
city
of
Leiden
,
the
Netherlands
,
we
first
compared
the
MTHFR
genotype
distribution
among
365
elderly
subjects
aged
85
years
and
over
born
in
Leiden
,
and
250
young
subjects
aged
18
to
40
years
whose
families
originated
from
the
same
geographical
region
.

Second
,
the
complete
cohort
of
666
subjects
aged
85
years
and
over
was
followed
over
a
period
of
10
years
for
all
-
cause
and
cause
-
specific
mortality
and
stratified
according
to
MTHFR
genotype
.

The
frequency
of
the
MTHFR
mutation
was
significantly
lower
in
the
elderly
than
in
the
young
(
0
.
30
and
0
.
36
,
respectively
;
P
=
0
.
03
)
.

The
difference
in
genotype
distribution
was
only
present
in
men
.

The
estimated
mortality
risk
up
to
85
years
in
men
carrying
the
vallval
genotype
was
3
.

(
95
%
confidence
interval
(
CI
)
,

-
10
.

)
.

Over
the
age
of
85
,
mortality
in
men
with
the
vallval
genotype
was
increased
2
.
0
-
fold
(
95

)
and
appeared
to
be
attributable
to
cancer
rather
than
cardiovascular
causes
of
death
.

Among
women
aged
85
years
and
over
,
no
deleterious
effect
of
the
MTHFR
mutation
was
observed
.

In
conclusion
,
the
MTHFR
mutation
is
associated
with
increased
mortality
in
men
in
middle
and
old
age
,
but
not
in
women
.

The
NDUFA1
gene
product
(
MWFE
protein
)
is
essential
for
activity
of
complex
I
in
mammalian
mitochondria
.

The
MWFE
polypeptide
of
mammalian
complex
I
(
the
proton
-
translocating
NADH
-
quinone
oxidoreductase
)
is
70
amino
acids
long
,
and
it
is
predicted
to
be
a
membrane
protein
.

The
NDUFA1
gene
encoding
the
MWFE
polypeptide
is
located
on
the
X
chromosome
.

This
polypeptide
is
1
of
approximately
28
"
accessory
proteins
"
identified
in
complex
I
,
which
is
composed
of
42
unlike
subunits
.

It
was
considered
accessory
,
because
it
is
not
one
of
the
14
polypeptides
making
up
the
core
complex
I
;
a
homologous
set
of
14
polypeptides
can
make
a
fully
functional
proton
-
translocating
NADH
-
quinone
oxidoreductase
in
prokaryotes
.

One
MWFE
mutant
has
been
identified
and
isolated
from
a
collection
of
respiration
-
deficient
Chinese
hamster
cell
mutants
.

The
CCL16
-
B2
mutant
has
suffered
a
deletion
that
would
produce
a
truncated
and
abnormal
MWFE
protein
.

In
these
mutant
cells
,
complex
I
activity
is
reduced
severely
(
<
10
%
)
.

Complementation
with
hamster
NDUFA1
cDNA
restored
the
rotenone
-
sensitive
complex
I
activity
of
these
mutant
cells
to
approximately
100
%
of
the
parent
cell
activity
.

Thus
,
it
is
established
that
the
MWFE
polypeptide
is
absolutely
essential
for
an
active
complex
I
in
mammals
.

Synthesis
of
thrombin
-
inhibiting
heparin
mimetics
without
side
effects
.

Unwanted
side
effects
of
pharmacologically
active
compounds
can
usually
be
eliminated
by
structural
modifications
.

But
the
complex
heterogeneous
structure
of
the
polysaccharide
heparin
has
limited
this
approach
to
fragmentation
,
leading
to
slightly
better
-
tolerated
heparin
preparations
of
low
molecular
mass
.

Despite
this
improvement
,
heparin
-
induced
thrombocytopaenia
(
HIT
)
,
related
to
an
interaction
with
platelet
factor
4
(
PF4
)
and
,
to
a
lesser
extent
,
haemorrhages
,
remain
significant
side
effects
of
heparinotherapy
.

Breakthroughs
in
oligosaccharide
chemistry
made
possible
the
total
synthesis
of
the
pentasaccharide
antithrombin
-
binding
site
of
heparin
.

This
pentasaccharide
represents
a
new
family
of
potential
antithrombotic
drugs
,
devoid
of
thrombin
inhibitory
properties
,
and
free
of
undesired
interactions
with
blood
and
vessel
components
.

To
obtain
more
potent
and
well
-
tolerated
antithrombotic
drugs
,
we
wished
to
synthesize
heparin
mimetics
able
to
inhibit
thrombin
,
that
is
,
longer
oligosaccharides
.

Like
thrombin
inhibition
,
undesired
interactions
are
directly
correlated
to
the
charge
and
the
size
of
the
molecules
,
so
we
had
to
design
structures
that
were
able
to
discriminate
between
thrombin
and
other
proteins
,
particularly
PF4
.

Here
we
describe
the
use
of
multistep
converging
synthesis
to
obtain
sulphated
oligosaccharides
that
meet
these
requirements
.

Effects
of
candesartan
and
cilazapril
on
rats
with
myocardial

assessed
by

.

The
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
compare
the
angiotensin

type
1
receptor
antagonist
candesartan
cilexitil
(
candesartan
)
and
the
angiotensin
-

enzyme
inhibitor
cilazapril
on
cardiac
function
,
assessed
by
Doppler
echocardiography
and
cardiac
gene
expression
associated
with
cardiac
remodeling
,
in
rats
with
myocardial
infarction
.

Candesartan
or
cilazapril
was
administered
after
myocardial
infarction
.

At
1
and
4
weeks
after
myocardial
infarction
,
cardiac
function
and
mRNA
expression
in
noninfarcted
myocardium
were
analyzed
.

Candesartan
and
cilazapril
equally
prevented
increases
in
hypertrophy
in
noninfarcted
myocardium
,
left
ventricular
dilatation
,
and
ejection
fraction
at
4
weeks
.

The

.

Candesartan
and
cilazapril
,
administered
at
a
dose
of
1
mg
/
kg
per
day
,
prevented
increases
in
E
-
wave
/
A
-
wave
velocity
ratio
and
E
-
wave
deceleration
at
1
and
4
weeks
.

Candesartan
and
cilazapril
significantly
suppressed
increased
mRNA
expression
of
beta
-
myosin
heavy

,
alpha
-
skeletal
actin
,
and
atrial
natriuretic
peptide
in
noninfarcted

at
1
and
4
weeks
and
expression
of
collagen

and

at
4
weeks
to
a
similar
extent
.

When
given
at
a
dose
of
10
mg
/
kg
per
day
,
both
candesartan
and
cilazapril
prevented
cardiac
dysfunction
and
gene
expression
to
the
same
extent
as
when
given
at
1
mg
/
kg
per
day
.

In
conclusion
,
Doppler
echocardiography
showed
that
candesartan
and
cilazapril
equally
improved
systolic
and
diastolic
function
and
that
ventricular
remodeling
accompanied
modulation
of
cardiac
gene
expression
.

Genetic
causes
of
mild
hyperhomocysteinemia
in
patients
with
premature
occlusive
coronary
artery
diseases
.

Elevated
plasma
homocysteine
is
increasingly
being
recognized
as
a
risk
factor
for
coronary
artery
disease
(
CAD
)
.

Although
there
is
general
agreement
on
the
importance
of
micronutrients
and
genetic
predisposition
to
elevated
plasma
homocysteine
,
the
exact
influence
of
the
known
prevalent
mutations
in
genes
which
regulate
homocysteine
metabolism
is
not
clear
.

We
studied
376
cases
of
individuals
with
premature
CAD
with
respect
to
their
fasting
and
post
-
methionine
load
(
PML
)
total
homocysteine
(
tHcy
)
concentrations
.

We
also
determined
the
presence
or
absence
of
the
T833C
and
G919A
mutations
of
the
cystathionine
-
beta
-
synthase
(
CBS
)
gene
,
the
C677T
mutation
of
the
methylene
tetrahydrofolate
reductase
(
MTHFR
)
gene
,
and
the
A2756G
transition
of
the
B12
dependent
methionine
synthase
(
MS
)
gene
.

Our
objectives
were
therefore
both
to
confirm
the
relationship
of
plasma
homocysteine
with
premature
CAD
and
to
examine
the
importance
of
genetic
influence
on
both
fasting
and
PML
homocysteine
.

Approximately
32
%
of
the
CAD
patients
had
fasting
hyperhomocysteinemia
and
16
%
had
PML
hyperhomocysteinemia
.

Of
these
,
8
.
5
%
had
both
forms
of
hyperhomocysteinemia
(
combined
hyperhomocysteinemia
)
.

The
T133C
mutation
in
the
CBS
gene
and
the
thermolabile
C677T
mutation
in
the
MTHFR
gene
seem
to
play
an
important
role
in
the
subset
of
individuals
with
combined
hyperhomocysteinemia
.

The
A2756G
transition
in
the
MS
gene
is
not
associated
with
elevated
plasma
tHcy
.

Many
cases
(
47
%
)
of
hyperhomocysteinemia
are
not
associated
with
micronutrient
deficiencies
,
impaired
renal
function
,
and
/
or
currently
known
genetic
mutations
.

Further
work
is
needed
to
study
whether
unknown
mutations
,
particularly
those
residing
in
the
intronic
sequences
of
the
genes
involved
in
homocysteine
metabolism
,
other
environmental
factors
,
or
interaction
of
gene
,
nutrient
,
and
environmental
factors
may
be

Effects
of

The
anticholinesterase
effects
of
bis
(

)
-
tacrine
were
compared
with
tacrine
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
.

Based
on
IC50
ratios
,
the
dimeric
analog
bis
(
7
)
-
tacrine
was
,
in
a
reversible
manner
,
up
to
150

fold
more
potent
and
250
-
fold
more
selective
than
tacrine
for
acetylcholinesterase
(
AChE
)
over
butyrylcholinesterase
(
BChE
)
.

Following
a
single
oral
administration
,
both
bis
(

)
-
tacrine
and
tacrine
produced
dose

dependent
inhibitions
of

in
rat

,
but
bis
(
7
)
-
tacrine
exhibited
higher
efficacy
and
AChE
/
BChE
selectivity
than
tacrine
.

The
anti

efficacy
of
bis
(

)
-
tacrine
was
quite
similar
following
an
oral

administration
,
but
tacrine
showed
much
lower
efficacy
when
administered

than
when

These
findings
suggest
bis
(

-
tacrine
,
a

of

,
can
probably
be
used

A
second
candidate

andromedin
in

.

Fibroblast
growth
factor
(
FGF
)
-
10
,
a
homologue
of
FGF
-
7
,
is
expressed
significantly
in
normal
rat
prostate
tissue
,
well
differentiated
rat
prostate
tumors
with
an
epithelial
and
stromal
compartment
and
only
in
derived
prostate
stromal
cells
in
culture
.

Similar
to
FGF
-
7
,
recombinant
rat
FGF
-
10
was
a
specific
mitogen
for
prostate
epithelial
cells
.

In
contrast
to
FGF
-
7
which
is
widely
expressed
among
stromal
cells
in
tissues
,
the
expression
of
FGF
-
10
correlated
with
the
presence
of
stromal
cells
of
muscle
origin
.

Radioreceptor
binding
assays
and
covalent
cross
-
linking
analysis
revealed
that
FGF
-
10
binds
with
an
affinity
equal
to
FGF
-
7
to
resident
epithelial
cell
receptor
,
FGFR2IIIb
,
but
unlike
FGF
-
7
also
binds
the
IIIb
splice
variant
of
FGFR1
.

Analysis
of
mRNA
expression
by
RNase
protection
revealed
that
,
similar
to
FGF
-
7
,
the
expression
of
FGF
-
10
was
responsive
to
androgen
in
stromal
cells
from
normal
prostate
and
non
-
malignant
differentiated
tumors
.

Although
FGF
-
10
cDNA
exhibits
a
signal
sequence
for
secretion
,
cultured
stromal
cells
exhibit
strictly
a
cell
-
associated
FGF
-
10
antigen
that
correlates
with
an
alternately
translated
intracellular
isoform
.

FGF
-
10
requires
1
.
4
times
higher
NaCl
for
elution
from
immobilized
heparin
than
does
FGF
-
7
and
binds
to
four
times
the
number
of
sites
on
the
pericellular
matrix
of
epithelial
cells
.

The
results
show
that
prostate
stromal
cell
-
derived
FGF
-
10
,
like
FGF
-
7
,
exhibits
the
properties
of
an
andromedin
which
may
indirectly
mediate
control
of
epithelial
cell
growth
and
function
by
androgen
.

Although
FGF
-
10
and
FGF
-
7
bind
and
activate
the
same
resident
epithelial
cell
receptor
(
FGFR2IIIb
)
,
differences
in
cell

,
the
affinity
for
FGFR1IIIb
,
and
access
to

suggest
they
may
play
both

When

Selective
inhibition
of
cyclooxygenase
2
spares
renal
function
and
prostaglandin
synthesis
in
cirrhotic
rats
with
ascites
.

BACKGROUND
&
AIMS
:
The
critical
role
of
cyclooxygenase
(
COX
)
products
in
maintenance
of
renal
function
in
cirrhosis
with
ascites
discourages
the
use
of
nonsteroidal
anti
-
inflammatory
drugs
in
this
disease
.

The
recent
development
of
selective
COX
-
2
inhibitors
opens
new
avenues
for
the
use
of
these
compounds
in
decompensated
cirrhosis
.

The
current
study
evaluates
the
effects
of
a
selective
COX
-
2
inhibitor
(
SC
-
236
)
on
renal
function
in
cirrhotic
rats
with
ascites
.

METHODS
:
In
protocol
1
,
urine
volume
,
urinary
excretion
of
sodium
and
prostaglandins
,
glomerular
filtration
rate
,
and
renal
plasma
flow
were
measured
before
and
after
administration
of
SC
-
236
(
n
=
12
)
or
ketorolac
(
n
=
10
)
to
rats
with
cirrhosis
.

Protocol
2
was
aimed
at
assessing
the
effects
of
COX
inhibitors
on
renal
water
metabolism
in
28
cirrhotic
rats
.

RESULTS
:
Administration
of
SC
-
236
to
cirrhotic
animals
did
not
produce
significant
renal
effects
,
whereas
administration
of
the
nonselective
COX
-
1
/
COX
-
2
inhibitor
,
ketorolac
,
resulted
in
a
marked
reduction
in
urine
volume
,
urinary
excretion
of
prostaglandins
,
and
glomerular
filtration
rate
and
in
a
significant
impairment
in
renal
water
metabolism
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
These
findings
indicate
that
SC
-
236
does
not
significantly
impair
renal
function
in
rats
with
cirrhosis
.

[
Pharmacodynamic
and
pharmacokinetic
aspects
of
the
non
-
inflammatory
non
-
steroidal
agent
meloxicam
in
dogs
]
.

The
pharmacodynamics
of
non
-
steroidal
anti
-
inflammatory
drugs
(
NSAIDs
)
are
for
the
most
part
well
-
understood
.

All
NSAIDs
inhibit
the
enzyme
cyclooxygenase
(
COX
)
,
and
for
this
reason
prostaglandin
synthesis
.

Two
isoforms
of
COX
could
be
isolated
.

COX
-
1
is
detectable
in
most
tissues
on
a
constant
level
and
is
responsible
for
the
synthesis
of
prostaglandins
with
cytoprotective
effects
.

COX
-
2
is
induced
through
inflammation
and
supports
the
inflammatory
process
by
producing
pro
-
inflammatory
prostaglandins
.

The
desired
effects
of
NSAIDs
are
related
to
inhibition
of
COX
-
2
,
whereas
inhibition
of
COX
-
1
has
been
linked
to
the
typical
side
-
effects
of
NSAIDs
,
especially
in
the
stomach
and
kidney
.

The
great
differences
between
effects
and
side
-
effects
in
the
numerous
substances
can
be
explained
because
of
different
interactions
of
the
NSAIDs
on
COX
-
1
and
COX
-
2
.

In
various
test
systems
meloxicam
has
been
shown
to
be
a
preferential
inhibitor
of
COX
-
2
.

There
are
also
large
differences
between
the
individual
NSAIDs
with
regard
to
pharmacokinetics
.

Meloxicam
is
completely
absorbed
from
the
gastrointestinal
tract
and
has
an
elimination
half
-
life
of
24
hours
in
the
dog
.

It
is
excreted
in
faeces
and
urine
.

The
metabolites
,
detectable
in
urine
are
biologically
inactive
and
do
not
influence
the
prostaglandin
synthesis
in
the
kidney
.

In
the
underlying
study
,
plasma
concentration
of
meloxicam
was
determined
after
a
subcutaneous
injection
of
0
.
2
mg
/
kg
b
.

w
.

(
day
1
)
followed
by
oral
treatment
of
0
.
1
mg
/
kg
b
.

w
.

(
days
2
-
14
)
.

The
results
confirm
the
recommended
dosage
regime
of
meloxicam
with
its
initial
loading
dose
and
the
subsequent
maintenance
dose
.

This
dosing
regime
results
in
a
very
favourable
curve
of
concentrations
with
a
very
rapidly
attained
steady
state
after
roughly
two
days
,
without
accumulation
even
in
long
-
term
treatment
.

An
important

to
beta

lactam
antibiotics
is
inactivation
by
beta

(

)
.

The
evolution
of
the
extended

(
ESBLs
)
is
associated
with
extensive
use
of
beta

antibiotics
,
particularly

,
and
is
a
serious
threat
to
therapeutic
efficacy

.

In

,
this

was
associated
with
high

.

When
the

was

,
increasing
the

,
the
MK

0826
MIC
range
increased
to
0

to

.

By
comparison
,
similar
observations
were
made
with
meropenem
while
imipenem
MICs
were
usually
less
affected
.

Not
surprisingly
,
MIC
increases
with
noncarbapenem
beta
-
lactams
were
generally
substantially
greater
,
resulting
in
resistance
in
many
cases
.

E

strains
that
produce

of
the

Molecular
cloning
and
characterization
of
a

from
rat

.

A
cDNA
encoding
the
new
member
of
the
multispecific
organic

transporter
family
,
OAT3
,
was
isolated
by
the
reverse

cloning
method
.

Degenerate
primers
were
designed
based
on
the
sequences
conserved
among
OAT1
,
OAT2
,
and
organic
cation
transporter
1
(

)
,
and
reverse
transcription
-
polymerase
chain
reaction
was
performed
using
rat
brain
poly
(
A
)
+
RNA
.

The
536

amino

protein
sequence
encoded
by
OAT3
showed
49
,
39
,
and
36
%
identity
to
those
of
OAT1
,
OAT2
,
and
OCT1
,
respectively
.

Northern

analysis
revealed
that
rat
OAT3
mRNA
is
expressed
in
the
liver
,
brain
,
kidney
,
and
eye
.

When
expressed
in
Xenopus

,
OAT3
mediated

inhibited

did
not
.

Organic
cations
such
as
tetraethylammonium
,
guanidine
,
verapamil

did
not
interact
with
OAT3
.

Acidic
metabolites
of
neurotransmitters
derived
from
dopamine
,
epinephrine
,
norepinephrine
,
and
serotonin
inhibited
the
uptake
of
estrone

These
results
suggest
an
important
role
of
OAT3
in
the
excretion

of
endogenous

exogenous
organic
anions
,
especially
from
the
brain

Influence
of
halothane
on
phospholipase
A2
and
enzymatic
methylations
in
the
rat
retinal
membranes
.

Phospholipase
A2
(
PLA2
)
and
phospholipid
methylases
(
PLM
)
play
significant
roles
in
transmitter
release
and
membrane
signal
transduction
,
respectively
.

Previous
studies
have
indicated
that
PLMs
occur
in
the
rat
brain
synaptosomal
and
retinal
membranes
,
and
they
are
activated
under
halothane
anesthesia
.

The
influence
of
halothane
on
PLA2
is
not
known
.

Therefore
,
we
have
investigated
the
effect
of
halothane
on
retinal
PLA2
activity
.

Rat
retinal

During
phospholipid
methylation
of
retinal
membranes
with
S
-
adenosyl
-
L
-
methionine
in
the
presence
of
halothane
,
increased
amounts
of
fatty
acid
methyl
esters
(
FAME
)
were
formed
.

This
increase
in
FAME
(
45
%
)
was
possibly
due
to
the
hydrolysis
of
phospholipids
by
activated
PLA2
,
liberating
fatty
acids
which
were
methylated
.

This
increase
in
FAME
(
45
%
)
was
inhibited
by
mepacrine
(
quinacrine
)
(
10
microM
)
,
an
inhibitor
of
PLA2
.

These
observations
suggest
that
the
release
of
retinal
transmitters
(
dopamine
,
acetylcholine
and
others
)
is
affected
during
halothane
anesthesia
,
due
to
activation
of
PLA2
and
enhanced
fusogenic
activity
of
vesicular
membranes
with
plasma
membrane
and
depletion
of
vesicles
.

Atypical

cytopathology
and
immunohistochemistry
of
insulin

II
,

,
cathepsin

,
and
Ki
-

.

Insulin
-
like
growth
factor
(
IGF
)
-
II
is
a
potent
growth
factor
,
normally
controlled
by
a
number
of
other
factors
,
including
IGF
binding
proteins
and
IGF
binding
protein
proteases
.

In
general
,
the
latter
increase
the
bioavailability
of
IGF
by
cleaving
IGF
binding
proteins
.

Cathepsin
D
(
an
IGF
binding
protein
protease
)
was
also
implicated
in
tumor
invasion
.

Although
IGF
-
II
was
implicated
in
the
pathogeneses
of
various
childhood
neoplasms
,
its
significance
in
the
pathogenesis
of
atypical
teratoid
/
rhabdoid
tumor
of
the
central
nervous
system
(
ATRT
-
CNS
)
was
not
studied
to
date
.

We
present
clinicopathologic
features
of
two
cases
of
ATRT
-
CNS
.

In
addition
,
formalin
-
fixed
,
paraffin
-
embedded
tissue
sections
were
stained
immunohistochemically
for
IGF
-
II
,
IGF
receptor
type
1
,
cathepsin
D
,
and
Ki
-
67
.

Both
tumors
demonstrated
diffuse
strong
cytoplasmic
positivity
for
IGF
-
II
,
diffuse
cytoplasmic
and
focal
membranous
positivity
for
IGF
receptor
type
I
,
and
diffuse
cytoplasmic
positivity
for
cathepsin
D
.

The
Ki
-
67
labeling
indices
were
10
.
0
%
and
1
.
4
%
.

We
conclude
that
ATRT
-
CNS
cells
express
both
IGF
-
II
and
IGF
receptor
type
1
,
supporting
the
hypothesis
that
autocrine
/
paracrine
stimulation
of
cell
growth
by
IGF
-
II
might
be
one
mechanism
involved
in
ATRT
-
CNS
tumorigenesis
.

Cathepsin
D
expressed
by
the
tumor
cells
might
also
be
involved
in
both
tumor
cell
invasion
and
growth
.

The
exact
pathogenesis
of
ATRT
-
CNS
remains
to
be
elucidated
.

Is
phentermine
an
inhibitor
of
monoamine
oxidase
?

A
critical
appraisal
.

Phentermine
produces
a
spectrum
of
concentration
-
dependent
biochemical
effects
.

It
interacts
with
NE
transporters
at
0
.
1
microM
,
DA
transporters
at
about
1
microM
,
5
-
HT
transporters
at
15
microM
and
MAO
-
A
at
about
100
microM
.

When
administered
at
typical
anorectic
doses
,
phentermine
primarily
interacts
with
DA
and
NE
transporters
and
does
not
produce
biochemical
or
neurochemical
effects
which
would
occur
if
it
were
inhibiting
MAO
-
A
.

Some
other
explanation
other
than
MAO
inhibition
must
be
sought
to
explain
how
oral
phentermine
increases
platelet
5
-
HT
,
since
platelet
MAO
-
B
does
not
metabolize
platelet
5
-
HT
,
and
since
amphetamine
-
type
drugs
are
even
weaker
inhibitors
of
MAO
-
B
than
MAO
-
A
.

Clinical
studies
in
humans
have
shown
that
amphetamine
,
which
is
a
more
potent
inhibitor
of
MAO
-
A
than
phentermine
,
does
not
inhibit
MAO
-
A
at
therapeutic
doses
.

Neither
phentermine
alone
,
fluoxetine
alone
or
their
combined
use
have
been
associated
with
cardiac
valvulopathy
,
and
clinical
experience
has
shown
their
combined
use
to
be
free
of
significant
adverse
effects
.

Viewed
collectively
,
there
appears
to
be
no
data
to
support
the
hypothesis
that
phentermine
inhibits
MAO
at
typical
therapeutic
doses
.

Identification
of
a
nuclear
receptor
for
bile
acids
.

Bile
acids
are
essential
for
the
solubilization
and
transport
of
dietary
lipids
and
are
the
major
products
of
cholesterol
catabolism
.

Results
presented
here
show
that
bile
acids
are
physiological
ligands
for
the
farnesoid
X
receptor
(
FXR
)
,
an
orphan
nuclear
receptor
.

When
bound
to
bile
acids
,
FXR
repressed
transcription
of
the
gene
encoding
cholesterol
7alpha
-
hydroxylase
,
which
is
the
rate
-
limiting
enzyme
in
bile
acid
synthesis
,
and
activated
the
gene
encoding
intestinal
bile
acid
-
binding
protein
,
which
is
a
candidate
bile
acid
transporter
.

These
results
demonstrate
a
mechanism
by
which
bile
acids
transcriptionally
regulate
their
biosynthesis
and
enterohepatic
transport
.

Inhibition
of
cPLA2
translocation
and
leukotriene
C4
secretion
by
fluticasone
propionate
in
exogenously
activated
human
eosinophils
.

We
examined
the
effect
of
the
highly
lipophilic
corticosteroid
,
fluticasone
propionate
(
FP
)
,
in
causing
(
1
)
inhibition
of
nuclear
translocation
of

A2
(
cPLA2
)
,
and
(

)
blockade
of
leukotriene
C4
(
LTC4
)
synthesis
in
isolated
human
eosinophils
in

.

Eosinophils
were
isolated
from
peripheral
blood
,
treated
with
either
buffer
or
10

10
M
to

M
FP
in

(

.

At
24
h
,
stimulated
LTC4
secretion
from
eosinophils
was
unchanged
;
however
,
when
corrected
for

stimulated
translocation
of

By
contrast
,
membrane
expression
of
annexin
-

,
which
was
not
minimal
at
30
min
,
was
substantial
at
48
h
for
eosinophils
treated
with
>
10
(

)
10
M
FP
,
and
inhibition
of
LTC4
synthesis
was
reversed
by
exogenous
arachidonic
acid
(
AA
)
.

We
find
that
FP
causes
a
decrease
in
stimulated
eosinophil
secretion
of
LTC4
that
is
regulated
by
phospholipase
A2
(
PLA2
)
.

Inhibition
of
LTC4
synthesis
precedes
the
global
cytotoxic
effects
of
FP
as
indicated
by
the
simultaneous
upregulation
of
annexin
-

expression
.

Inhibited
stimulated
secretion
corresponds
to
inhibited
translocation
of
cPLA2
to
the
nuclear
envelope
during
cellular
activation
.

Hyperammonemia
:
regulation
of
argininosuccinate
synthetase
and
argininosuccinate
lyase
genes
in
aggregating
cell
cultures
of
fetal
rat
brain
.

Hyperammonemia
in
the
brain
leads
to
poorly
understood
alterations
of
nitric
oxide
(
NO
)
synthesis
.

Arginine
,
the
substrate
of
nitric
oxide
synthases
,
might
be
recycled
from
the
citrulline
produced
with
NO
by
argininosuccinate
synthetase
(
AS
)
and
argininosuccinate
lyase
(
AL
)
.

The
regulation
of
AS
and
AL
genes
during
hyperammonemia
is
unknown
in
the
brain
.

We
used
brain
cell
aggregates
cultured
from
dissociated
telencephalic
cortex
of
rat
embryos
to
analyze
the
regulation
of
AS
and
AL
genes
in
hyperammonemia
.

Using
RNase
protection
assay
and
non
-
radioactive
in
situ
hybridization
on
aggregate
cryosections
,
we
show
that
both
AS
and
AL
genes
are
induced
in
astrocytes
but
not
in
neurons
of
aggregates
exposed
to
5
mM
NH4Cl
.

Our
work
suggests
that
the
hyperammonemic
brain
might
increase
its
recycling
of
citrulline
to
arginine
.

Reduced
satiating
effect
of
d
-
fenfluramine
in
serotonin
5
-
HT
(
2C
)
receptor
mutant
mice
.

RATIONALE
:
d
-
Fenfluramine
stimulates
the
release
of
serotonin
(
5
-
HT
)
and
is
a
potent
inhibitor
of
the
re
-
uptake
of
5
-
HT
into
nerve
terminals
.

Administration
of
d
-
fenfluramine
suppresses
food
intake
in
both
animals
and
humans
.

OBJECTIVE
:
We
have
investigated
the
role
of
the
5
-
HT2C
receptor
in
mediating
the
effect
of
d
-
fenfluramine
on
mouse
food
intake
and
the
behavioural
satiety
sequence
.

METHODS
:
Mutant
mice
lacking
serotonin
5
-
HT2C
receptors
and
wild
-
type
animals
were
habituated
to
a
daily
presentation
of
wet
mash
.

Animals
were
non
-
deprived
and
received
d
-
fenfluramine
(
3
-
30
mg
/
kg
)
30
min
prior
to
being
assessed
for
the
presence
of
stereotypy
and
presented
with
wet
mash
.

The
behaviour
of
animals
was
observed
for
the
subsequent
40
min
and
food
intake
was
recorded
.

RESULTS
:
d
-
Fenfluramine
dose
-
dependently
inhibited
the
consumption
of
a
palatable
wet
mash
by
the
mice
.

d
-
Fenfluramine
(
3
mg
/
kg
)
significantly
reduced
the
amount
of
wet
mash
consumed
by
wild
-
type
mice
and
induced
a
temporal
advance
in
the
behavioural
satiety
sequence
consistent
with
an
enhancement
of
satiety
.

Mutant
mice
were
less
sensitive
to
the
satiating
effects
of
3
mg
/
kg
d
-
fenfluramine
.

Hence
,
this
dose
of
d
-
fenfluramine
had
a
reduced
effect
on
both
food
consumption
and
the
behavioural
satiety
sequence
in
the
5
-
HT2C
mutant
mice
.

In
contrast
,
mutant
mice
showed
an
increased
sensitivity
to
the
stereotypy
induced
by
high
doses
of
d
-
fenfluramine
(
10
,
30
mg
/
kg
)
compared
to
that
of
wild
-
type
littermates
.

CONCLUSION
:
These
data
demonstrate
a
role
for
the
5
-
HT2C
receptor
in
mediating
d
-
fenfluramine
-
induced
satiety
.

Role
of
acetylcholinesterase
(
AChE
)
secreted
by
parasitic
nematodes
on
the
growth
of
the
cell
line
from
epithelial
origin
HT29
-
D4
.

The
excretory
-
secretory
(
E
-
S
)
products
of
the
parasitic
nematodes
Trichostrongylus
colubriformis
and
Nematodirus
battus
were
found
to
modify
the
in
vitro
proliferation
of
the
tumorous
colic
HT29
-
D4
cell
line
of
epithelial
origin
.

A
characteristic
feature
of
these
E
-
S
products
is
the
presence
of
a
high
level
of
acetylcholinesterase
(
AChE
)
activity
,
the
biological
significance
of
which
remains
unclear
.

To
determine
a
possible
role
of
AChE
on
cell
growth
,
the
enzyme
was
purified
from
E
-
S
products
using
edrophonium
chloride
.

Purity
was
confirmed
by
polyacrylamide
gel
electrophoresis
,
using
silver
and
Karnovsky
stains
,
before
assessing
its
effects
on
cell
proliferation
.

The
purified
AChE
was
incorporated
at
different
concentrations
in
a
culture
medium
of
HT29
-
D4
cells
.

A
mitogenic
effect
was
shown
for
low
concentrations
(
0
.
1
-
14
units
)
.

By
contrast
,
an
inhibitory
effect
was
noted
at
high
concentrations
(
35
-
1400
units
)
.

Furthermore
,
polyclonal
antibodies
were
prepared
and
depletion
of
AChE
in
E
-
S
products
by
immunoprecipitation
or
affinity
chromatography
resulted
in
a
partial
or
total
disappearance
of
the
stimulatory
effect
of
cell
growth
.

Thus
,
the
results
form
this
in
vitro
study
suggest
a
modulatory
role
for
AChE
secreted
by
nematode
parasites
on
the
proliferation
of
epithelial
cells
of
the
host
.

Methimazole
and
propylthiouracil
increase
cellular
thyroid
peroxidase
activity
and
thyroid
peroxidase
mRNA
in
cultured
porcine
thyroid
follicles
.

Methimazole
(
MMI
)
and
propylthiouracil
(
PTU
)
are
common
antithyroid
drugs
for
treating
hyperthyroidism
because
the
2
drugs
inhibit
thyroid
peroxidase
(
TPO
)
-
catalyzed
thyroid
hormone
formation
.

We
studied
whether
the
2
drugs
actually
inhibit
cellular
TPO
activity
in
cultured
porcine
follicles
.

Porcine
follicles
were
cultured
in
the
presence
of
1
mU
/
mL
thyrotropin
(
TSH
)
for
7
days
.

Then
follicles
were
exposed
to
MMI
or
PTU
in
the
presence
of
0
.
1
microM
Kl
for
2
days
.

TPO
activity
was
measured
in
the
100
,
000
x
g
-
pellet
of
the
thyroid
sonicate
by
the
guaiacol
oxidation
method
.

Exposure
to
MMI
(
1
microM
and
10
microM
)
or
PTU
(
10
microM
and
100
microM
)
for
2
days
caused
a
significant
increase
in
cellular
TPO
activity
;
100
microM
MMI
inhibited
cellular
TPO
activity
.

The
presence
of
cyclic
adenosine
monophosphate
(
cAMP
)
-
generating
system
(
forskolin
)
in
TSH
-
free
medium
increased
MMI
-
mediated
TPO
activity
.

Cyclohexamide
inhibited
MMI
-
mediated
TPO
activation
,
indicating
that
new
protein
synthesis
is
required
for
increased
TPO
activity
.

Reverse
transcriptase
-
polymerase
chain
reaction
(
RT
-
PCR
)
showed
an
increase
in
TPO
mRNA
by
PTU
or
MMI
.

In
conclusion
,
MMI
and
PTU
at
therapeutic
concentrations
can
increase
TPO
mRNA
and
cellular
TPO
activity
,
although
the
2
drugs
inhibit
the
TPO
-
H2O2
-
mediated
catalytic
reaction
.

Structure
of
acetylcholinesterase
complexed
with
E2020
(
Aricept
)
:
implications
for
the
design
of
new
anti
-
Alzheimer
drugs
.

BACKGROUND
:
Several
cholinesterase
inhibitors
are
either
being
utilized
for
symptomatic
treatment
of
Alzheimer
'
s
disease
or
are
in
advanced
clinical
trials
.

E2020
,
marketed
as
Aricept
,
is
a
member
of
a
large
family
of
N
-
benzylpiperidine
-
based
acetylcholinesterase
(
AChE
)
inhibitors
developed
,
synthesized
and
evaluated
by
the
Eisai
Company
in
Japan
.

These
inhibitors
were
designed
on
the
basis
of
QSAR
studies
,
prior
to
elucidation
of
the
three
-
dimensional
structure
of
Torpedo
californica
AChE
(
TcAChE
)
.

It
significantly
enhances
performance
in
animal
models
of
cholinergic
hypofunction
and
has
a
high
affinity
for
AChE
,
binding
to
both
electric
eel
and
mouse
AChE
in
the
nanomolar
range
.

RESULTS
:
Our
experimental
structure
of
the
E2020
-
TcAChE
complex
pinpoints
specific
interactions
responsible
for
the
high
affinity
and
selectivity
demonstrated
previously
.

It
shows
that
E2020
has
a
unique
orientation
along
the
active
-
site
gorge
,
extending
from
the
anionic
subsite
of
the
active
site
,
at
the
bottom
,
to
the
peripheral
anionic
site
,
at
the
top
,
via
aromatic
stacking
interactions
with
conserved
aromatic
acid
residues
.

E2020
does
not
,
however
,
interact
directly
with
either
the
catalytic
triad
or
the
'
oxyanion
hole
'
,
but
only
indirectly
via
solvent
molecules
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
Our
study
shows
,
a
posteriori
,
that
the
design
of
E2020
took
advantage
of
several
important
features
of
the
active
-
site
gorge
of
AChE
to
produce
a
drug
with
both
high
affinity
for
AChE
and
a
high
degree
of
selectivity
for
AChE
versus
butyrylcholinesterase
(
BChE
)
.

It
also
delineates
voids
within
the
gorge
that
are
not
occupied
by
E2020
and
could
provide
sites
for
potential
modification
of
E2020
to
produce
drugs
with
improved
pharmacological
profiles
.

Maturation
of

in

.

We
have
examined
the
rapid

of
synaptic

clamp
recording
of
spontaneous
miniature
endplate
currents
(
mEPCs
)
and
single
acetylcholine
receptor
(
AChR
)
channels
.

Embryonic
(
24
-
36
h
)
mEPCs
recorded
in
vivo
were
small
in
amplitude
(
<
50
pA
)
.

The
rate
of
mEPCs
increased
in
larvae
(
3
.
5
-
fold
increase
measured
by
6
days
)
,
and
these
mEPCs
were
mostly
of
larger
amplitude
(
10

on
average
)
with
(

faster

.

Intracellular

with
Lucifer
yellow
indicated
extensive
coupling
between
muscle
cells
in
both
embryos
and

(
<

)
.

Blocking
acetylcholinesterase
(
AChE
)
with
eserine
had
no
effect
on
mEPC
kinetics
in
embryos
at
1
day
and
only
partially
slowed
(
by
approximately
1

)
the
decay
rate
in
larvae
at
6
days
.

In
acutely
dissociated
muscle
cells
,
we
observed
the
same
two
types
of
AChR
with
conductances
of
45
and

and
with
similar
,
brief
(

in
both

and

.

We
conclude
that
AChR
properties
are
set
early
during
development
at
these
early
stages
;
functional
maturation
of
the
NMJ
is
only
partly
shaped
by
expression
of
AChE
and
may
also
depend
on
postsynaptic
AChR
clustering
and
presynaptic
maturation
.

Multiple
mechanisms
of
action
:
the
pharmacological
profile
of
budipine
.

Four
major
components
of
the
mechanism
of
action
have
been
identified
for
the
antiparkinsonian
drug
budipine
up
to
now
.

1
)
The
primary
action
of
budipine
is
an
indirect
dopaminergic
effect
as
shown
by
facilitation
of
dopamine
(
DA
)
release
,
inhibition
of
monoamine
oxidase
type
B
(
MAO
-
B
)
and
of
DA
(
re
)
up
-
take
and
stimulation
of
aromatic
L
-
amino
acid
decarboxylase
(
AADC
)
,
which
in
sum
might
be
responsible
for
enhancing
the
endogenous
dopaminergic
activity
.

2
)
Radioligand
and
functional
studies
at
the
N
-
methyl
-
D
-
aspartate
(
NMDA
)
type
glutamate
receptor
characterize
budipine
as
a
low
-
affinity
,
uncompetitive
antagonist
with
fast
kinetics
and
moderate
voltage
-
dependency
at
the
phencyclidine
(
PCP
)
binding
site
,
comparable
to
that
observed
with
amantadine
,
thereby
counteracting
an
increased
excitatory
glutamatergic
activity
.

3
)
The
antimuscarinic
action
of
budipine
,
verified
by
functional
and
binding
studies
at
native
muscarinic
M1
-
M3
and
human
recombinant
m1
-
m5
receptor
subtypes
in
vitro
,
is
up
to
125
-
fold
weaker
than
that
of
biperiden
and
corresponds
to
its
approximately
100
-
fold
lower
potency
to
cause
experimentally
-
induced
peripheral
antimuscarinic
effects
and
explains
only
part
of
its
high
potency
,
which
equals
biperiden
,
to
suppress
cholinergically
evoked
tremor
.

4
)
An
additional
inhibition
of
striatal
gamma
-
aminobutyric
acid
(
GABA
)
release
by
budipine
may
be
beneficial
to
suppress
an
increased
striatal
GABAergic
output
activity
.

The
contribution
of
other
observed
effects
to
the
therapeutic
action
of
budipine
,
i
.
e
.
weak
stimulation
of
noradrenaline
and
serotonin
release
,
binding
to
brain
sigma1
receptors
and
blockade
of
histamine
H1
receptors
,
is
not
yet
clear
.

By
means
of
these
multiple
mechanisms
,
budipine
might
correct
the
imbalance
of
striatal
output
pathways
by
restoring
DA
levels
in
the
striatum
,
and
positively
influence
the
secondary
changes
in
other
transmitter
systems
(
glutamate
,
acetylcholine
,
GABA
)
observed
in
Parkinson
'
s
disease
.

Disparate
actions
of
mifepristone
(
RU
486
)
on
glands
and
stroma
in
the
primate
endometrium
.

Besides
being
an
antiprogestin
,
mifepristone
(
RU
486
)
was
recently
shown
to
antagonize
oestrogen
-
dependent
growth
in
the
endometrium
.

To
explore
the
molecular
mechanisms
for
this
phenomenon
,
we
investigated
whether
or
not
the
morphological
effects
of
mifepristone
are
mediated
by
the
progesterone
receptor
(
PR
)
and
whether
mifepristone
has
disparate
effects
on
the
glandular
epithelium
and
stroma
.

Six
groups
of
hypogonadal
,
oestrogen
-
primed
cynomolgus
monkeys
were
treated
for
2
weeks
with
:
vehicle
only
(
group
I
)
;
mifepristone
(
group
II
)
;
mifepristone
plus
progesterone
at
0
.
2
mg
/
kg
(
group
III
)
,
1
.
0
mg
/
kg
(
group
IV
)
or
5
.
0
mg
/
kg
(
group
V
)
;
and
progesterone
only
(
5
.
0
mg
/
kg
)
(
group
VI
)
.

Histomorphological
evaluation
showed
strikingly
compacted
stroma
in
the
mifepristone
-
exposed
endometria
(
group
II
)
,
which
was
partially
reversible
by
additional
progesterone
treatment
(
groups
III
-
V
)
.

Glandular
proliferation
(
pseudostratification
,
glandular
mitoses
)
in
mifepristone
-
treated
monkeys
was
not
significantly
different
from
that
in
vehicle
(
oestradiol
)
-
treated
monkeys
,
but
was
inhibited
by
progesterone
-
only
treatment
.

Cells
containing
vacuoles
were
scarce
in
the
mifepristone
-
exposed
endometrium
,
but
detected
frequently
in
progesterone
-
exposed
endometria
,
indicating
the
strong
antisecretory
effect
of
mifepristone
on
glands
.

We
conclude
that
oestrogen
-
dependent
oedema
in
the
stroma
is
antagonized
by
mifepristone
.

The
reversal
of
this
effect
by
progesterone
suggests
a
PR
-
mediated
mechanism
.

In
glands
,
mifepristone
is
antiprogestogenic
,
but
not
antioestrogenic
.

Thus
,
stromal
cells
may
be
the
target
of
antiprogestin
-
induced
inhibition
of
oedema
and
endometrial
growth
.

An
Arg
/
Ser
substitution
in
the
second
epidermal
growth
factor
-
like
module
of
factor
IX
introduces
an
O

carbohydrate
and
markedly
impairs
activation
by
factor
XIa
and

VIIa
/
Tissue
factor
and
catalytic
efficiency
of
factor

.

Factor
IXR94S
is
a
naturally
occurring
hemophilia
B
defect
,
which
results
from
an
Arg
94
to
Ser
mutation
in
the
second
epidermal
growth
factor
(
EGF
)
-
like
module
of
factor
IX
.

Recombinant
factor
IXR94S
was
activated
by
factor
XIa
/
calcium
with
an
approximately
50
-
fold
reduced
rate
and
by
factor
VIIa
/
tissue
factor
/
phospholipid
/
calcium
with
an
approximately
20
-
fold
reduced
rate
compared
with
wild
-
type
factor
IX
.

The
apparent
molecular
mass
of
the
light
chain
of
factor
IXaR94S
was
approximately
6
kD
higher
than
that
of
plasma
or
wild
-
type
factor
IX
,
which
was
not
corrected
by
N
-
glycosidase
F
digestion
.

This
result
indicated
the
presence
of
additional
O
-
linked
carbohydrate
in
the
mutant
light
chain
,
probably
at
new
Ser
94
.

The
initial
rate
of
activation
of
factor
X
by
factor
IXaR94S
in
the
presence
of
polylysine
was
7
%
+
/
-
1
%
of
the
initial
rate
of
activation
of
factor
X
by
plasma
factor
IXa
,
and
the
kc
/
Km
for
activation
of
factor
X
by
factor
IXaR94S
/
factor
VIIIa
/
phospholipid
/
calcium
was
4
%
+
/
-
1
%
of
the
kc
/
Km
for
activation
of
factor
X
by
plasma
factor
IXa
/
factor
VIIIa
/
phospholipid
/
calcium
.

The
reduced
efficiency
of
activation
of
factor
X
by
factor
IXaR94S
in
the
tenase
enzyme
complex
was
due
to
a
58
-
fold
+
/
-
12
-
fold
decrease
in
kcat
with
little
effect
on
Km
.

In
conclusion
,
the
R94S
mutation
had
introduced
an
O
-
linked
carbohydrate
,
which
markedly
impaired
both
activation
by
factor
XIa
and
turnover
of
factor
X
in
the
tenase
enzyme
complex
.

Expression
of
multiple
alpha1
-
adrenoceptors
on
vascular
smooth
muscle
:
correlation
with
the
regulation
of
contraction
.

Previous
work
has
shown
that
the
genes
encoding
each
alpha1
-
adrenoceptor
subtype
are
coexpressed
throughout
the
peripheral
vascular
system
.

We
have
evaluated
subtype
-
selective
antibodies
as
tools
to
determine
the
extent
of
protein
expression
in
arteries
.

The
alpha1A
-
,
alpha1B

,
and
alpha1D
-
adrenoceptors
were
detected
in
the
medial
layer
of
the
aorta
,
caudal
,
femoral
,
iliac
,
renal
,
superior
mesenteric
,
and
mesenteric

arteries
.

In
Rat1
fibroblasts
expressing
each
subtype
,
immunoreactivity
was
noted
both
on
the
cell
surface
and
in
a
perinuclear
orientation
.

Intense
alpha1B
-
adrenoceptor
immunostaining
was
similarly
localized
in
cultured
femoral
and
renal
vascular
smooth
muscle
cells
.

Although
the
cellular
localization
appeared
to
be
the
same
,
immunoreactivity
obtained
with
alpha1A
-
and
alpha1D
-
adrenoceptors
was
much
less
intense
than
that
with
the
alpha1B
-
adrenoceptor
.

The
alpha1A
-
adrenoceptor
selective
agonist
A
-
61603
was
22
-
fold
more
potent
in
activating
renal
artery
contraction
when
compared
with
the
femoral
artery
.

The
expression
of
each
alpha1
-
adrenoceptor
was
significantly
decreased
by
in
vivo
application
of
antisense
oligonucleotides
targeted
against
each
subtype
.

Inhibition
of
the
expression
of
only
one
,
the
alpha1A
in
renal
and
the
alpha1D
in
femoral
arteries
,
reduced
the
contractile
response
to
naphazoline
.

The
results
show
:

be
used
in

to
localize

Probing
the
structural
changes
in
the
light
chain
of
human

due
to
tissue

association
.

The
crystallographic
structure
of
human
coagulation
factor
VIIa
/
tissue
factor
complex
bound
with
calcium
ions
was
used
to
model
the
solution
structure
of
the
light
chain
of
factor
VIIa
(
residues

-
142
)
in
the
absence
of

The
Amber
force
field
in
conjunction
with
the
particle
mesh
Ewald
summation
method
to
accommodate
long

range
electrostatic
interactions
was
used
in
the
trajectory
calculations
.

The
estimated
TF
-
free
solution
structure
was
then
compared
with
the
crystal
structure
of
factor
VIIa
/
tissue
factor
complex
to
estimate
the
restructuring
of
factor
VIIa
due
to
tissue

binding
.

The
solution
structure
of
the
light
chain
of
factor
VIIa
in
the
absence
of
tissue
factor
is
predicted
to
be
an
extended

structure
similar
to
that
of
the

.

Removal
of
the
EGF1
-
bound
calcium
ion
is
shown
by
simulation
to
lead
to
minor
structural
changes
within
the
EGF1
domain
,
but
also
leads
to
substantial
relative
reorientation
of
the
Gla

Each

contains
two
independently
folded
domains
connected
by
a

.

By
using
the

formyl
5
,
8
-
dideazafolate
and
5

,
respectively
,
we
have
determined
that
the
tight
binding
folate
site
is
separate
from
the
catalytic
site
and
that
it
is
located
on
the
N
-
terminal
domain
of
the
protein
.

This
was
achieved
by
cross

linking
10

formyl
5
,
8
-
dideazafolate
to
the
dehydrogenase
through
the
carboxyl
group
of
the

The
cross

analog
was
converted
to
the

by
adding
either

,
proving
that
the
10

was
bound
at

With

Inhibition

necrosis
factor
alpha
-
stimulated
aromatase
activity
by
microtubule
-
stabilizing
agents
,
paclitaxel
and
2
-
methoxyestradiol
.

The
aromatase
enzyme
,
which
converts
androstenedione
to
oestrone
,
regulates
the
availability
of
oestrogen
to
support
the
growth
of
hormone
-
dependent
breast
tumours
.

Cytokines
,
such
as
interleukin
6
(
IL

)
and
tumour
necrosis
factor
alpha
(
TNFalpha
)
or
prostaglandin
E
(
2
)
(
PGE
(
2
)
)
,
can
stimulate
aromatase
activity
.

These
factors
may
originate
from
cells
of
the
immune
system
that
infiltrate
breast
tumours
.

Paclitaxel
,
which
is
used
in
the
treatment
of
breast
cancer
,
stabilizes
microtubules
and
has
previously
been
shown
to
rapidly
down
-
regulate
TNF
-
receptors
on
human
macrophages
.

The
endogenous
oestrogen
metabolite
,
2
-
methoxyestradiol
(
2
-
meOE2
)
,
also
acts
to
stabilize
microtubules
.

In
this
study
,
we
have
examined
the
ability
of
paclitaxel
or
2
-
meOE2
to
antagonise
TNFalpha
-
stimulated
aromatase
activity
in
stromal
fibroblasts
derived
from
normal
or
malignant
breast
tissues
.

Paclitaxel
inhibited
basal
and
TNFalpha
-
stimulated
aromatase
activities
by
88
%
and
91
%
respectively
.

2
-
MeOE2
also
reduced
basal
and
TNFalpha
-
stimulated
aromatase
activities
by
46
%
and
56
%
respectively
.

Both
paclitaxel
and
2
-
meOE2
also
inhibited
stimulation
of
aromatase
activity
by
IL
-
6
plus
its
soluble
receptor
and
PGE
(
2
)
.

The
16alpha
-
hydroxylated
derivative
of
2
-
meoE2
and
2
-
meOE3
,
which
does
not
bind
to
microtubules
,
was
less
effective
at
inhibiting
TNFalpha
-
stimulated
aromatase
activity
.

Increased
2
-
hydroxylation
of
oestrogens
,
and
subsequent
formation
of
their
2
-
methoxy
derivatives
,
may
be
associated
with
a
reduced
risk
of
breast
cancer
.

It
is
possible
that
the
pathway
of
oestrogen
metabolism
may
influence
the
ability
of
stromal
cells
to
respond
to
cytokine
stimulation
.

Insulin

Increased

may
accelerate
atherosclerosis
by
exposing
vascular
luminal
wall
surfaces
to
persistent
and
recurrent
thrombi
.

Abnormalities
in
the
vessel
wall
appear
to
contribute
to
the
increased
risk
.

There
is
also
evidence
that
PAI
-
1
content
is
increased
in
atherosclerotic
lesions
of
patients
with
type
2
diabetes
,
suggesting
that
interventions
to
reduce
insulin
resistance
and
improve
glycemic
control
may
improve
the
fibrinolytic
response
.

Clinical
studies
in
patients
with
polycystic
ovary
syndrome
(
characterized
by
insulin
resistance
,
hyperinsulinemia
,
ovarian
androgen
overproduction
,
and
impaired
fibrinolytic
capacity
)
demonstrated
that
treatment
with
troglitazone
,
an
insulin
-
sensitizing
agent
,
can
markedly
reduce
blood
levels
of
PAI
-
1
.

There
is
also
clinical
evidence
that
these
agents
may
contribute
to
regression
of
intimal
medial
thickness
in
patients
with
type
2
diabetes
,
providing
further
indication
that
antidiabetic
interventions
may
help
inhibit
the
progression
of
early
atherosclerotic
lesions
.

An
estrogen
receptor
basis
for
raloxifene
action
in
bone
.

Although
controversy
remains
regarding
direct
effects
of
estrogen
on
bone
,
in
vivo
data
clearly
show
that
estrogens
suppress
bone
turnover
,
resulting
in
decreased
bone
resorption
and
formation
activity
.

Selective
estrogen
receptor
modulators
(
SERMs
)
,
such
as
raloxifene
,
produce
effects
on
bone
which
are
very
similar
to
those
of
estrogen
.

In
vitro
,
both
raloxifene
and
estrogen
inhibit
mammalian
osteoclast
differentiation
and
bone
resorption
activity
,
but
only
in
the
presence
of
IL
-
6
.

Data
from
a
number
of
ovariectomized
rat
model
manipulations
(
i
.
e
.
hypophysectomy
,
low
calcium
diet
and
drug
combinations
)
demonstrate
a
strong
parallel
between
the
antiosteopenic
effects
of
raloxifene
and
estrogen
.

A
characteristic
action
of
estrogens
on
the
skeleton
is
inhibition
of
longitudinal
bone
growth
,
an
effect
which
is
not
observed
with
other
resorption
inhibitors
,
including
calcitonin
and
bisphosphonates
.

Consistent
with
an
estrogen
-
like
mechanism
on
bone
,
raloxifene
inhibits
longitudinal
bone
growth
in
growing
rats
.

In
addition
to
the
overall
similarity
of
the
bone
activity
profile
in
animals
,
estrogen
and
raloxifene
also
produce
similar
effects
on
various
signaling
pathways
relative
to
the
antiosteopenic
effect
of
these
two
agents
.

For
example
,
IL
-
6
,
a
cytokine
involved
in
high
turnover
bone
resorption
following
estrogen
deficiency
in
rats
,
is
suppressed
by
both
raloxifene
and
estrogen
.

Raloxifene
and
estrogen
also
produce
a
similar
activation
of
TGF
-
beta3
(
a
cytokine
associated
with
inhibition
of
osteoclast
differentiation
and
activity
)
in
ovariectomized
rats
.

Like
17beta
-
estradiol
,
raloxifene
binds
with
high
affinity
to
both
estrogen
receptor
-
alpha
(
ER
alpha
)
and
estrogen
receptor
-
beta
(
ER
beta
)
.

Crystal
structure
analyses
have
shown
that
17beta
-
estradiol
and
raloxifene
bind
to
ER
alpha
with
small
,
but
important
,
differences
in
three
dimensional
structure
.

These
subtle
differences
in
the
conformation
of
the
ligand
:
receptor
complex
are
likely
the
basis
for
the
key
pharmacological
differences
between
estrogens
and
the
various
SERMs
(
i
.
e
.
raloxifene
vs
tamoxifen
)
.

Raloxifene
also
produces
estrogen
-
like
effects
on
serum
cholesterol
metabolism
and
the
vasculature
.

Thus
,
while
raloxifene
exhibits
a
complete
estrogen
antagonist
in
mammary
tissue
and
the
uterus
,
it
produces
beneficial
effects
on
the
cardiovascular
system
and
prevents
bone
loss
via
an
estrogen
receptor
mediated
mechanism
.

Discovery
of
novel
peptidic
dopamine
transporter
ligands
by
screening
a
positional
scanning
combinatorial
hexapeptide
library
.

The
acute
reinforcing
effects
of
cocaine
are
thought
by
some
to
result
from
cocaine
binding
to
the
dopamine
(
DA
)
transporter
,
which
inhibits
DA
uptake
and
increases
synaptic
DA
levels
in
the
mesolimbic
system
.

Other
data
suggest
that
neurotransmitters
other
than
DA
contribute
to
cocaine
reinforcement
and
addiction
.

These
considerations
illustrate
the
need
to
have
additional
research
tools
with
which
to
test
the
"
DA
hypothesis
.
"
One
strategy
is
to
identify
drugs
which
bind
to
the
DA
transporter
(
DAT
ligands
)
but
which
do
not
inhibit
DA
uptake
as
effectively
as
cocaine
.

The
purpose
of
the
present
study
was
to
identify
members
of
a
novel
structural
class
of
DAT
ligands
and
to
characterize
their
interactions
at
the
DA
transporter
.

A
positional
scanning
hexapeptide
D
-
amino
acid
library
was
screened
for
inhibition
of
[
(
125
)
I
]
RTI
-
55
binding
to
rat
caudate
DA
transporters
.

Based
on
the
results
,
12
peptides
were
synthesized
.

All
12
peptides
inhibited
[
(
125
)
I
]
RTI
-
55
binding
to
DA
transporters
with
IC
(
50
)
values
,
which
ranged
from
1
.
8
microM
to
12
microM
.

The
two
most
potent
peptides
(
TPI
-
669
-
1
and
TPI
-
669
-
4
)
were
prepared
in
larger
quantities
and
were
characterized
further
for
activity
at
the
DAT
and
5
-
HT
transporter
.

Both
peptides
inhibited
DA
and
5
-
HT
uptake
and
transporter
binding
with
IC
(
50
)
/
K
(
i
)
values
in
the
low
micromolar
range
.

In
vivo
microdialysis
studies
demonstrated
that
both
peptides
increase
extracellular
DA
and
5
-
HT
in
the
nucleus
accumbens
of
rats
.

These
data
demonstrate
that
peptides
can
function
as
inhibitors
of
biogenic
amine
transport
.

Future
work
will
focus
on
developing
more
potent
and
selective
peptides
.

Comparison
of

that

be
due

in
the
tactile
allodynia
and
thermal
hyperalgesia
associated
with
an
experimental
model
of
neuropathic

was
investigated
.

Neuropathic
pain
was
induced
by
tight

of
the

.

Tactile
allodynia
was
assessed
7
days
after
the
surgery
by
measuring
hindpaw

and
by
applying

Minimal

Piroxicam

were

Finally

However
,
there
was
no
synergy
between
morphine

in
either
of
the
tests

These
findings
suggest
that
spinal
prostanoids
produced
via
both
COX1

COX2
pathways
may
play
a
role
in
neuropathic
pain
states
and
suggest
the
clinical

Desipramine
treatment
decreases

nisoxetine
binding
and
norepinephrine
transporter
mRNA
in

The

desipramine
has
been
shown
to
decrease
synaptic
membrane
concentrations
of
the
norepinephrine
re
-
uptake
transporter
(
NET
)
in
vivo
and
in

,
on
both
an
acute
and
a
chronic
basis
.

The
possible
contribution
of
decreased
NET
synthesis
to
the
chronic
downregulation
of
the
NETs
has
not
been
definitively
established
.

In
this
study
,
we
treated
SK

N
-
SHSY5Y
cells
with
100
nM
desipramine
for
24

72

,
and
measured
3H

nisoxetine
binding
(
as
an
estimate
of
NETs
)
and
NET
mRNA
by
quantitative
reverse
transcription
polymerase
chain
reaction
.

Similar
to
what
has
been
reported
previously
,
membrane
3H
-
nisoxetine
binding
was
significantly
decreased
at
both
24
and
72
h
(
approximately
50
%
at
both
time
points
)
.

However
,
a
significant
decrease
(
64

8
%
of
paired
control
)
of
NET
mRNA
was
observed
only
at
the
72

h
time
point
.

We
conclude
that
decreased
NET
synthesis
may
contribute
to
the
chronic
,
but
not
acute
,
effect
of
desipramine
to
downregulate
the
NET

High

mouse
relative
to
human
(
approximately

may
complicate
the
study
of
antitumor

and
toxicity
of
TS
inhibitors
with
human
tumor
xenografts
grown
in
the
mouse
.

To
test
this
hypothesis
,
we
preadministered
methoxypolyethyleneglycol
-
conjugated
thymidine
phosphorylase
(
MPEG
-
TPase
;
2500
units
/
kg

)
to
reduce

,
then
treated
with

of
ZD1694
using
the
daily
x

or
i
.
v
.
x

schedules
in
the
A253
tumor
model
.

MPEG

significantly
increased
the

;
the

,
respectively
.

However
,
preadministration
of
MPEG

TPase
did
not
potentiate
the
antitumor
activity
of
ZD1694
with
either
schedule
.

The
data
indicate
that
the
study
of
TS
inhibitors
in
rodent
models
may
not
be
suitable
for
predicting
a
safe
dose
for
clinical

.

However
,
rodent

,
particularly

,
are
still
useful
models
for
evaluation
of

Crystal
structure
of
human
quinone
reductase
type
2
,
a
metalloflavoprotein
.

In
mammals
,
two
separate
but
homologous
cytosolic
quinone
reductases
have
been
identified
:
NAD
(

)
H
:
quinone
oxidoreductase
type

(
QR1
)
(
EC

)
and
quinone
reductase
type
2
(
QR2
)
.

Although
QR1
and
QR2
are
nearly
50
%
identical
in
protein
sequence
,
they
display
markedly
different
catalytic
properties
and
substrate
specificities
.

We
report
here
two
crystal
structures
of
QR2
:
in
its
native
form
and
bound
to
menadione
(
vitamin
K

)
)
,
a
physiological
substrate
.

Phases
were
obtained
by
molecular
replacement
,
using
our
previously
determined
rat
QR1
structure
as
the
search
model
.

QR2
shares
the
overall
fold
of
the
major
catalytic
domain
of
QR1
,
but
lacks
the
smaller
C
-
terminal
domain
.

The
FAD
binding
sites
of
QR1
and
QR2
are
very
similar
,
but
their
hydride
donor
binding
sites
are
considerably
different
.

Unexpectedly
,
we
found
that
QR2
contains
a
specific
metal
binding
site
,
which
is
not
present
in
QR1
.

Two
histidine
nitrogens
,
one
cysteine
thiol
,
and
a
main
chain
carbonyl
group
are
involved
in
metal
coordination
.

The
metal
binding
site
is
solvent

accessible
,
and
is
separated
from
the
FAD
cofactor
by
a
distance
of
about
13

Marimastat
inhibits
elastin
degradation
and
matrix
metalloproteinase
2
activity
in
a
model
of
aneurysm
disease
.

BACKGROUND
:
Abdominal
aortic
aneurysms
are
characterized
by
degradation
of
the
extracellular
matrix
,
with
a
reduction
in
the
elastin
concentration
of
the
arterial
media
.

These
changes
have
been
linked
to
increased
levels
of
endogenous
metalloproteinases
(
MMPs
)
within
the
aorta
,
particularly
MMP
-
2
and
MMP
-
9
.

This
provides
a
potential
therapeutic
target
for
pharmacological
agents
aimed
at
reducing
the
growth
rate
of
small
aneurysms
.

In
this
study
,
the
ability
of
marimastat
(
an
MMP
inhibitor
)
to
reduce
matrix
degradation
was
assessed
in
a
previously
described
model
of
aneurysm
disease
.

METHODS
:
Porcine
aortic
segments
(
n
=
12
)
were
preincubated
in
exogenous
pancreatic
elastase
for
24
h
before
culture
in
standard
conditions
for
13
days
with
marimastat

)
,

)
and

(
-

)
mol
/
l
.

Control
segments
were
cultured
both
without
marimastat
and
without
elastase
.

At
the
termination
of
culture
,
MMPs
were
extracted
from
the
tissue
and
quantified
by
substrate
gel
enzymography
.

The
volume
fractions
of
elastin
and
collagen
were
determined
by
stereological
analysis
of
sections
stained
with
Miller
'
s
elastin
and
van
Gieson
'
s
stain
.

RESULTS
:
Stereological
analysis
demonstrated
preservation
of
elastin
in
aorta
treated
with
marimastat
at
10
(
-
6
)
and
10
(
-
5
)
mol
/
l
;
this
was
significant
at
the
latter
concentration
(
P
=

)
.

This
was
accompanied
by
a
significant
reduction
in
active
MMP

activity
in
the
samples
treated
with
marimastat

CONCLUSION
:
Marimastat
significantly
inhibited

[
The
relation
between
metabolism
of
biopterin
and
dystonia
-
parkinsonism
]
.

Tetrahydrobiopterin
(
BH4
)
is
an
essential
cofactor
for
tyrosine
hydroxylase
.

BH4
can
be
synthesized
from
GTP
through
three
enzymatic
reactions
.

The
rate
-
limiting
step
of
the
BH4
synthesis
is
catalyzed
by
GTP
cyclohydrolase
I
(
GCH
)
.

Recently
,
we
found
that
GCH
is
a
causative
gene
for
hereditary
progressive
dystonia
/
dopa
-
responsive
dystonia
(
HPD
/
DRD
)
.

However
,
several
problems
still
remain
to
be
solved
.

The
first
concern
is
the
presence
of
asymptomatic
carriers
in
the
disease
.

The
difference
between
symptomatic
and
asymptomatic
carriers
is
unknown
.

Second
,
we
cannot
find
any
mutation
in
the
coding
region
of
the
GCH
gene
in
about
40
%
of
the
patients
.

What
kind
of
mutation
would
be
present
in
these
patients
.

The
last
concern
is
the
molecular
mechanism
how
the
enzymatic
activity
is
decreased
to
less
than
20
%
of
normal
values
.

Further
studies
are
required
to
solve
the
questions
.

Use

that
induce

we
report
the

was
raised
against
a
region
in
the
N
-
terminal
domain
of
human
PPARgamma
shared
by
splice
variants
PPARgamma1

PPARgamma2
.

It
recognizes
immunizing

)
,
and
does
not
cross

react
with
the
N

domains
of
PPARalpha
or
PPARdelta
.

In
Western
blotting
,
PgammaA53
.
25
reacts
with
the
immunizing
antigen
as
well
as
distinct
protein

to
the

The
fluorescence
intensity
of
the
treated
cells
is
TZD
dose
-
dependent
,
and
correlates
with
lipid
accumulation
consistent
with
adipogenesis
.

Based
on
these
results
,
we
propose
that
MAb
PgammaA53
.
25
will
be
a
useful
tool
for
elucidating
the
role
of
PPARgamma
in
fatty

Increased
cyclooxygenase
-
2
expression
in
human
pancreatic
carcinomas
and
cell
lines
:
growth
inhibition
by
nonsteroidal
anti
-
inflammatory
drugs
.

Cyclooxygenase
(
COX
)
-
2
mRNA
and
protein
expression
were
found
to
be
frequently
elevated
in
human
pancreatic
adenocarcinomas
and
cell
lines
derived
from
such
tumors
.

Immunohistochemistry
demonstrated
cytoplasmic
COX
-
2
expression
in
14
of
21
(
67
%
)
pancreatic
carcinomas
.

The
level
of
COX
-
2
mRNA
was
found
to
be
elevated
in
carcinomas
,
relative
to
histologically
normal
pancreas
from
a
healthy
individual
,
as
assessed
by
reverse
transcription
-
PCR
.

COX
-
2
protein
expression
was
detected
by
the
Western
blot
assay
in
three
of
five
pancreatic
carcinoma
cell
lines
(
BxPC
-
3
,
Capan
-
1
,
and
MDAPanc
-
3
)
,
whereas
COX
-
1
protein
was
detected
in
two
of
the
five
cell
lines
(
BxPC
-
3
and
Capan
-
1
)
.

Increased
levels
of
COX
-
2
mRNA
were
found
in
four
of
five
cell
lines
,
and
only
in
PANC
-
1
cells
was
the
low
level
of
transcript
comparable
to
that
in
the
normal
pancreas
.

The
level
of
COX
-
2
mRNA
was
positively
correlated
with
the
differentiation
status
of
the
tumor
of
origin
for
each
cell
line
,
COX
-
2
protein
expression
was
up
-
regulated
by
epidermal
growth
factor
when
the
cells
were
grown
in
absence
of
serum
.

Finally
,
two
nonsteroidal
anti
-
inflammatory
drugs
,
sulindac
sulfide
and
NS398
,
produced
a
dose
-
dependent
inhibition
of
cell
proliferation
in
all
pancreatic
cell
lines
tested
.

No
correlation
was
found
between
the
level
of
COX
-
2
or
COX
-
1
expression
and
the
extent
of
growth
inhibition
.

Treatment
of
BxPC
-
3
cells
with
sulindac
sulfide
and
NS398
resulted
in
an
induction
of
COX
-
2
expression
.

Our
findings
indicate
that
COX
-
2
up
-
regulation
is
a
frequent
event
in
pancreatic
cancers
and
suggest
that
nonsteroidal
anti
-
inflammatory
drugs
may
be
useful
in
the
chemoprevention
and
therapy
of
pancreatic
carcinoma
.

Inhibition
of
ATM
and
ATR
kinase
activities
by
the
radiosensitizing
agent
,
caffeine
.

Caffeine
exposure
sensitizes
tumor
cells
to
ionizing
radiation
and
other
genotoxic
agents
.

The
radiosensitizing
effects
of
caffeine
are
associated
with
the
disruption
of
multiple
DNA
damage
-
responsive
cell
cycle
checkpoints
.

The
similarity
of
these
checkpoint
defects
to
those
seen
in
ataxia
-
telangiectasia
(
A
-
T
)
suggested
that
caffeine
might
inhibit
one
or
more
components
in
an
A
-
T
mutated
(
ATM
)
-
dependent
checkpoint
pathway
in
DNA
-
damaged
cells
.

We
now
show
that
caffeine
inhibits
the
catalytic
activity
of
both
ATM
and
the
related
kinase
,
ATM
and
Rad3
-
related
(
ATR
)
,
at
drug
concentrations
similar
to
those
that
induce
radiosensitization
.

Moreover
,
like
ATM
-
deficient
cells
,
caffeine
-
treated
A549
lung
carcinoma
cells
irradiated
in
G2
fail
to
arrest
progression
into
mitosis
,
and
S
-
phase
-
irradiated
cells
exhibit
radioresistant
DNA
synthesis
.

Similar
concentrations
of
caffeine
also
inhibit
gamma
-
and
UV
radiation
-
induced
phosphorylation
of
p53
on
Ser15
,
a
modification
that
may
be
directly
mediated
by
the
ATM
and
ATR
kinases
.

DNA
-
dependent
protein
kinase
,
another
ATM
-
related
protein
involved
in
DNA
damage
repair
,
was
resistant
to
the
inhibitory
effects
of
caffeine
.

Likewise
,
the
catalytic
activity
of
the
G2
checkpoint
kinase
,
hChk1
,
was
only
marginally
suppressed
by
caffeine
but
was
inhibited
potently
by
the
structurally
distinct
radiosensitizer
,
UCN
-
01
.

These
data
suggest
that
the
radiosensitizing
effects
of
caffeine
are
related
to
inhibition
of
the
protein
kinase
activities
of
ATM
and
ATR
and
that
both
proteins
are
relevant
targets
for
the
development
of
novel
anticancer
agents
.

the

Cell
culture
conditions
determine
apolipoprotein
CIII
secretion
and
regulation
by
fibrates
in
human
hepatoma
HepG2
cells
.

Fibrates
are
widely
used
drugs
which
lower
triglycerides
and
increase
HDL
concentrations
in
serum
.

Recent
findings
from
our
laboratory
have
shown
that
fibrates
repress
apolipoprotein
(
apo
)
CIII
gene
expression
,
an
effect
that
explains
partially
the
triglyceride
-
lowering
activity
of
these
drugs
.

The
goal
of
the
present
study
was
to
compare
the
effect
of
various
fibrates
on
apo
CIII
gene
expression
in
the
human
hepatoblastoma
cell
line
HepG2
.

First
,
we
demonstrate
that
the
level
of
apo
CIII
secretion
by
HepG2
cells
is
controlled
by
serum
factors
whereas
apo
CIII
mRNA
levels
are
not
and
even
increase
under
conditions
when
apo
CIII
secretion
dramatically
decreases
.

Twelve
different
fetal
calf
serum
batches
were
tested
during
this
study
and
apo
CIII
secretion
in
cell
medium
could
only
be
detected
with
three
of
them
.

The
effect
of
serum
on
apolipoprotein
secretion
was
more
pronounced
for
apo
CIII
whereas
other
apolipoproteins
(
apo
E
,
apo
B
,
apo
AII
and
apo
AI
)
were
affected
to
a
lesser
extent
.

Under
serum
conditions
allowing
apo
CIII
secretion
,
treatment
with
the
peroxisome
-
proliferator
activated
receptor
(
PPAR
)
alpha
activators
fenofibrate
,
gemfibrozil
and
Wy
-
14643
result
in
a
marked
lowering
of
apo
CIII
secretion
and
gene
expression
,
this
effect
being
most
pronounced
with
Wy
-
14643
.

Comparison
of
the
activity
of
a
PPARgamma
-
specific
ligand
,
the
antidiabetic
thiazolidinedione
,
BRL
-
49653
and
a
PPARalpha
ligand
Wy
-
14643
showed
a
marked
decrease
of
apo
CIII
secretion
and
gene
expression
after
activation
of
PPARalpha
but
not
PPARgamma
.

In
conclusion
,
fibrates
down
-
regulate
apo
CIII
gene
expression
in
human
HepG2
cells
,
most
likely
via
PPARalpha
but
not
via
PPARgamma
.

However
,
these
effects
are
only
observed
in
HepG2
cells
cultured
under
appropriate
conditions
.

Variations
of

c
-
fos
gene
expression
in
the
rat
uterus
after
treatment
with
norethisterone
and
its
A

reduced
metabolites
.

It
has
been
suggested
that
some
contraceptive
derivatives
of
19
-
nor
-
testosterone
possess
estrogenic
activity
that
may
facilitate
the
development
of
breast
cancer
.

The
aim
of
this
work
was
to
investigate
the
estrogenic
properties
of
norethisterone
(
NET
)
and
its
A
-
ring
-
reduced
derivatives
by
determining
progesterone
receptor
(
PR
)
and
c
-
fos
mRNA
content
of
two
estrogen
-
regulated
genes
in
the
uterus
of
ovariectomized
rats
.

mRNA
content
was
evaluated
by
Northern
blot
1
-
6
h
after
17
beta
-
estradiol
administration
.

The
highest
PR
and
c
-
fos
mRNA
content
was
observed
3
h
and
2
h
after
17
beta
-
estradiol
administration
,
respectively
.

NET
did
not
modify
either
PR
or
c
-
fos
mRNA
content
.

In
contrast
,
5
alpha
-
and
3
beta
,
5
alpha
-
NET
significantly
increased
mRNA
content
of
both
genes
.

The
increase
in
c
-
fos
mRNA
content
induced
by
these
reduced
compounds
was
lower
than
that
found
with
estradiol
treatment
.

The
overall
results
indicate
that
NET
administration
can
indirectly
induce
estrogenic
effects
through
the
action
of
its
5
alpha
-
dihydro
and
3
beta
,
5
alpha
-
tetrahydro
derivatives
.

Involvement
of

p21waf1
proteins
in
response
of
human
breast
cancer
cell
clones
to
Tomudex
.

Mechanisms
of
resistance
to
Tomudex
include
increased
thymidylate
synthase
activity
,
as
well
as
reduced
intracellular
drug
uptake
and
polyglutamation
.

However
,
little
is
known
about
other
mechanisms
of
resistance
,
such
as
a
possible
protection
against
Tomudex

induced
apoptosis
mediated

bcl

.

We
transfected
the
MDA
-
MB
-
435
human
breast
cancer
cell
line
,
which
is
characterized
by
a
mutated
p53
gene
,
with
cDNA
of
the
bcl
-
2
gene
and
generated
two
clones
(
MDA
-
bcl4
and
MDA
-
bcl7
)
characterized
by
bcl
-
2
expression
twofold
and
fourfold
that
observed
in
the
control
cell
clone
(
MDAneo
)
.

A
concomitant
overexpression
of
p21wafl
was
also
detected
in
the
MDA
-
bcl7
clone
.

The
MDA
-
bcl4
clone
was
three
times
more
resistant
to
a
24
-
h
Tomudex
exposure
than
the
MDAneo
clone
,
whereas
the
MDA
-
bcl7
clone
was
as
sensitive
to
Tomudex
as
the
control
cell
clone
.

A
lower
sensitivity
of
the
MDA
-
bcl4
clone
than
MDAneo
and
MDA
-
bcl7
clones
to
5
-
fluorouracil
and
gemcitabine
was
also
observed
.

No
significant
difference
was
noted
in
the
susceptibility
of
clones
to
fludarabine
and
methothrexate
.

Basal
levels
of
thymidylate
synthase
activity
were
superimposable
in
the
three
clones
.

Tomudex
induced
a
marked
accumulation
of
cells
in
the
S
phase
in
all
the
clones
.

However
,
an
apoptotic
hypodiploid
DNA
peak
and
the
characteristic
nuclear
morphology
of
apoptosis
were
observed
only
in
the
MDA
-
bcl7
clone
after
exposure
to
Tomudex
.

No
difference
in
the
treatment
-
induced
modulation
of
proteins
involved
in
cell
cycle
progression
(
cyclin
A
,
cdk2
,
pRB
,
E2F
-
1
)
and
apoptosis
(
bcl
-
2
,
bax
)
was
observed
in
the
three
clones
.

The
only
exception
was
that
the
expression
of
p21wafl
in
the
MDA
-
bcl4
clone
was
inducible
at
a
Tomudex
concentration
much
higher
than
that
required
to
induce
the
protein
in
the
other
clones
.

Overall
,
the
results
indicate
that
bcl
-
2
and
p21wafl
proteins
concur
in
determining
the
cellular
profile
of
sensitivity
/
resistance
to
Tomudex
.

Our

suggested
that

-
3beta
,
7beta
-
diol
(
Delta
(

-
androstenediol

Adiol
)
is
a
natural
hormone
with
androgenic
activity
and
that
two
potent
antiandrogens
,
hydroxyflutamide
(
Eulexin
)

bicalutamide
(

)
,
fail
to
block
completely
the
Adiol

in

.

Here
,
we
report
the
development
of

androgenic
activity
and
could
also
block
the
Adiol

in

.

Interestingly
,
these
compounds
,
in
combination
with
hydroxyflutamide
,
further
suppressed
the
Adiol

AR
transactivation
.

Reporter
assays
further
showed
that
these
four
anti
-
Adiol
steroids
have
relatively
lower
glucocorticoid
,
progesterone
,
and
estrogenic
activity
.

Together
,
these
data
suggest
some
selective
steroids
might
have
anti

Adiol
activity
,
which
may
have
potential
clinical
application
in
the
battle
against
the

EPR
studies
on
the
photo
-
induced
intermediates
of
ferric
NO
complexes
of
rat
neuronal
nitric
oxide
synthase
trapped
at
low
temperature
.

Rat
neuronal
nitric
oxide
synthase
(
nNOS
)
was
expressed
in
Escherichia
coli
and
purified
.

Although
the
nitric
oxide
(
NO
)
complex
of
the
ferric
heme
was
EPR
-
silent
,
photo
-
illumination
at
5
K
to
the
NO
complex
of
the
ferric
nNOS
in
the
substrate
-
free
form
produced
a
new
high
spin
EPR
signal
similar
to
that
of
the
ferric
heme
of
N
(
omega
)
-
nitro
-
L
-
arginine
-
bound
nNOS
,
suggesting
that
the
photo
-
dissociated
NO
might
move
away
from
the
heme
.

Low
photo
-
dissociability
of
NO
in
this
complex
indicated
less
restricted
movement
of
the
dissociated
NO
in
the
distal
region
of
the
heme
,
which
might
result
in
the
rapid
rebinding
of
the
NO
to
the
ferric
heme
at
5
K
.

In
the
presence
of
substrate
L
-
arginine
,
derivatives
,
or
product
L
-
citrulline
,
the
photo
-
products
from
the
ferric
NO
complexes
exhibited
large
novel
EPR
signals
with
a
spin
-
coupled
interaction
between
the
ferric
heme
(
S
=
5
/
2
)
and
the
photolyzed
NO
(
S
=
1

)
,
suggesting
a
stereochemically
restricted
interaction
between
the
photo

dissociated
NO
and
the
guanidino
-
or
the
ureido
-
group
of
the
substrate
analogues
at
the
distal
heme
region
of
nNOS
.

The
photo
-
product
from
the
NO
complex
produced
from
citrulline

bound
nNOS
might
be
the
same
intermediate
species
as
that
formed
in

Raloxifene
:
a
selective
estrogen
receptor
modulator
.

Raloxifene
is
a
selective
estrogen
receptor
modulator
that
produces
both
estrogen
-
agonistic
effects
on
bone
and
lipid
metabolism
and
estrogen
-
antagonistic
effects
on
uterine
endometrium
and
breast
tissue
.

Because
of
its
tissue
selectivity
,
raloxifene
may
have
fewer
side
effects
than
are
typically
observed
with
estrogen
therapy
.

The
most
common
adverse
effects
of
raloxifene
are
hot
flushes
and
leg
cramps
.

The
drug
is
also
associated
with
an
increased
risk
of
thromboembolic
events
.

The
beneficial
estrogenic
activities
of
raloxifene
include
a
lowering
of
total
and
low
-
density
lipoprotein
cholesterol
levels
and
an
augmentation
of
bone
mineral
density
.

Raloxifene
has
been

However
,
its
effects
on
fracture

and
its
ability
to
protect
against
cardiovascular
disease
have
yet
to
be
determined
.

Studies
are
also
being

its
impact
on

Cisapride
is

agent
which
has
been
associated
with

,
torsades

.

The
cellular
mechanism
for
these
observations
is
high

of
IKr
(
encoded
by
HERG
)
.

In

model
using

cells
,
cisapride
inhibited
HERG
tail

Channel

exhibited

In

to

.

These
findings
suggested
affinity
for
open

or
inactivated
channel
states
.

4
Inactivation
was
significantly
accelerated
by
cisapride
in
a
concentration

manner
and
there
was
a
small
(
-
7
mV
)
shift
in
the
voltage

of
steady

.

Channel

in
the
potency
of
channel
blockade
when
[

.

6
In
conclusion
,
HERG
channel
inhibition
by
cisapride
exhibits
features
consistent
with
open
and
inactivated
state
binding
and
is
sensitive
to
external

These
features
may
have

s
disease
(
PD
)
.

To
our
knowledge
,
this
effect
has
not
been
demonstrated
in
vivo
in
patients
with
PD
.

At
present
,
the
status
of
striatal
dopamine
D2
receptors
can
be
studied
with
use
of
positron
emission
tomographic
(
PET
)
technology
.

Five
patients
with
PD
chronically
treated
with
levodopa
were
studied
with
use
of
PET
and
[
11C
]
-
raclopride
before
and
after
6
months
of
pergolide
treatment
(
dose
range
=
4
.
5
-
7
.
5
mg
/
d
)
.

We
found
a
slight
reduction
in
the
specific
striatal
[
11C
]
-
raclopride
uptake
index
(
mean
reduction
14
%
in
putamen
and
9
%
in
caudate
)
after
pergolide
treatment
.

This
reduction
appears
to
be
related
to
downregulation
of
the
receptor
,
although
competitive
binding
of
pergolide
at
the
D2
receptor
cannot
be
excluded
.

Comparison
of
the
novel
antipsychotic
ziprasidone
with
clozapine
and
olanzapine
:
inhibition
of
dorsal
raphe
cell
firing
and
the
role
of
5
-
HT1A
receptor
activation
.

Ziprasidone
is
a
novel
antipsychotic
agent
which
binds
with
high
affinity
to
5
-
HT1A
receptors
(
Ki
=
3
.
4
nM
)
,
in
addition
to
5
-
HT1D
,
5
-
HT2
,
and
D2
sites
.

While
it
is
an
antagonist
at
these
latter
receptors
,
ziprasidone
behaves
as
a
5
-
HT1A
agonist
in
vitro
in
adenylate
cyclase
measurements
.

The
goal
of
the
present
study
was
to
examine
the
5
-
HT1A
properties
of
ziprasidone
in
vivo
using
as
a
marker
of
central
5
-
HT1A
activity
the
inhibition
of
firing
of
serotonin
-
containing
neurons
in
the
dorsal
raphe
nucleus
.

In
anesthetized
rats
,
ziprasidone
dose
-
dependently
slowed
raphe
unit
activity
(
ED50
=
300
micrograms
/
kg
i
.
v
.
)
as
did
the
atypical
antipsychotics
clozapine
(
ED50
=
250
micrograms
/
kg
i
.
v
.
)
and
olanzapine
(
ED50
=
1000
micrograms
/
kg
i
.
v
.
)
.

Pretreatment
with
the
5
-
HT1A
antagonist
WAY
-
100
,
635
(
10
micrograms
/
kg
i
.
v
.
)
prevented
the
ziprasidone
-
induced
inhibition
;
the
same
dose
of
WAY
-
100
,
635
had
little
effect
on
the
inhibition
produced
by
clozapine
and
olanzapine
.

Because
all
three
agents
also
bind
to
alpha
1
receptors
,
antagonists
of
which
inhibit
serotonin
neuronal
firing
,
this
aspect
of
their
pharmacology
was
assessed
with
desipramine
(
DMI
)
,
a
NE
re
-
uptake
blocker
previously
shown
to
reverse
the
effects
of
alpha
1
antagonists
on
raphe
unit
activity
.

DMI
(
5
mg
/
kg
i
.
v
.
)
failed
to
reverse
the
inhibitory
effect
of
ziprasidone
but
produced
nearly
complete
reversal
of
that
of
clozapine
and
olanzapine
.

These
profiles
suggest
a
mechanism
of
action
for
each
agent
,
5
-
HT1A
agonism
for
ziprasidone
and
alpha
1
antagonism
for
clozapine
and
olanzapine
.

The
5
-
HT1A
agonist
activity
reported
here
clearly
distinguishes
ziprasidone
from
currently
available
antipsychotic
agents
and
suggests
that
this
property
may
play
a
significant
role
in
its
pharmacologic
actions
.

CCK
-
mediated
response
in
the
activation
of
5
-
HT
receptor
types
in
the
guinea
-
pig
ileum
.

The
possible
interaction
between
cholecystokinin
(
CCK
)
and
5
-
hydroxytryptamine
(
5
-
HT
)
was
evaluated
in
vitro
in
the
longitudinal
muscle
-
myenteric
plexus
of
the
guinea
-
pig
ileum
.

Devazepide
and
L
-
365
,
260
were
used
to
block
CCKA
and
CCK
(
B
)
receptors
and
ondansetron
and
tropisetron
to
block
5
-
HT3
and
5
-
HT4
receptors
,
respectively
.

The
CCK
receptor
antagonists
blocked
,
in
a
dose
-
dependent
manner
,
the
response
to
5
-
HT
and
to
the
selective
agonists
at
5
-
HT3
and
5
-
HT4
receptors
,
2
-
methyl
-
5
-
hydroxytryptamine
(
2
-
Me
-
5
-
HT
)
and
5
-
methoxytryptamine
(
5
-
MeOT
)
,
respectively
.

The
blockade
was
almost
complete
on
the
first
phase
of
the
concentration
response
curve
to
5
-
HT
and
for
all
the
concentrations
of
5
-
MeOT
tested
.

In
the
2
-
Me
-
5
-
HT
-
induced
contractile
response
there
was
a
component
with
the
same
sensitivity
to
devazepide
and
to
the
selective
NK1
receptor
antagonist
,
GR
82334
,
and
another
resistant
component
that
was
abolished
by
atropine
.

However
,
the
blockade
of
the
NK1
receptor
did
not
produce
a
significant
increase
in
the
inhibition
obtained
when
atropine
or
devazepide
were
separately
tested
on
the
5
-
MeOT
-
induced
response
.

These
results
suggest
that
CCK
is
involved
in
the
5
-
HT
-
induced
contractile
response
,
particularly
in
the
response
induced
by
5
-
HT4
receptor
stimulation
.

Pharmacological
plasticity
of
cardiac
ATP
-
sensitive
potassium
channels
toward
diazoxide
revealed
by
ADP
.

The
pharmacological
phenotype
of
ATP
-
sensitive
potassium
(
K
(
ATP
)
)
channels
is
defined
by
their
tissue
-
specific
regulatory
subunit
,
the
sulfonylurea
receptor
(
SUR
)
,
which
associates
with
the
pore
-
forming
channel
core
,
Kir6
.
2
.

The
potassium
channel
opener
diazoxide
has
hyperglycemic
and
hypotensive
properties
that
stem
from
its
ability
to
open
K
(
ATP
)
channels
in
pancreas
and
smooth
muscle
.

Diazoxide
is
believed
not
to
have
any
significant
action
on
cardiac
sarcolemmal
K
(
ATP
)
channels
.

Yet
,
diazoxide
can
be
cardioprotective
in
ischemia
and
has
been
found
to
bind
to
the
presumed
cardiac
sarcolemmal
K
(
ATP
)
channel
-
regulatory
subunit
,
SUR2A
.

Here
,
in
excised
patches
,
diazoxide
(
300
microM
)
activated
pancreatic
SUR1
/
Kir6
.
2
currents
and
had
little
effect
on
native
or
recombinant
cardiac
SUR2A
/
Kir6
.
2
currents
.

However
,
in
the
presence
of
cytoplasmic
ADP
(
100
microM
)
,
SUR2A
/
Kir6
.
2
channels
became
as
sensitive
to
diazoxide
as
SUR1
/
Kir6
.
2
channels
.

This
effect
involved
specific
interactions
between
MgADP
and
SUR
,
as
it
required
Mg
(
2
+
)
,
but
not
ATP
,
and
was
abolished
by
point
mutations
in
the
second
nucleotide
-
binding
domain
of
SUR
,
which
impaired
channel
activation
by
MgADP
.

At
the
whole
-
cell
level
,
in
cardiomyocytes
treated
with
oligomycin
to
block
mitochondrial
function
,
diazoxide
could
also
activate
K
(
ATP
)
currents
only
after
cytosolic
ADP
had
been
raised
by
a
creatine
kinase
inhibitor
.

Thus
,
ADP
serves
as
a
cofactor
to
define
the
responsiveness
of
cardiac
K
(
ATP
)
channels
toward
diazoxide
.

The
present
demonstration
of
a
pharmacological
plasticity
of
K
(
ATP
)
channels
identifies
a
mechanism
for
the
control
of
channel
activity
in
cardiac
cells
depending
on
the
cellular
ADP
levels
,
which
are
elevated
under
ischemia
.

A
review
of
the
preclinical
and
clinical
data
of
newer
intranasal
steroids
used
in
the
treatment
of
allergic
rhinitis
.

The
anti
-
inflammatory
activity
of
corticosteroids
has
prompted
the
exploration
of
their
use
in
the
treatment
of
allergic
rhinitis
.

The
development
of
intranasal
steroids
has
resulted
in
several
agents
with
quick
actions
,
localized
effects
,
and
great
efficacy
in
the
treatment
of
seasonal
allergic
rhinitis
and
the
prophylactic
management
of
perennial
rhinitis
.

This
article
presents
a
concise
review
of
the
preclinical
and
clinical
evidence
with
these
new
agents
and
provides
data
-
based
guidance
for
the
selection
of
optimal
agents
.

The
survey
reveals
that
mometasone
furoate
,
a
new
inhaled
steroid
with
topical
activity
,
has
the
greatest
binding
affinity
for
the
glucocorticoid
receptor
,
followed
by
fluticasone
propionate
,
budesonide
,
triamcinolone
acetonide
,
and
dexamethasone
.

Mometasone
furoate
also
has
strong
anti
-
inflammatory
activity
,
with
IL
-
4
and
IL
-
5
inhibition
activities
equivalent
to
those
of
fluticasone
propionate
.

Clinically
,
both
mometasone
furoate
and
fluticasone
propionate
appear
to
be
well
tolerated
,
to
have
quick
onsets
of
action
,
and
to
be
equivalent
in
efficacy
in
the
treatment
of
seasonal
allergic
and
perennial
rhinitis
.

Of
the
intranasal
steroids
currently
available
,
mometasone
furoate
has
been
shown
to
have
the
least
systemic
availability
and
,
consequently
,
is
expected
to
have
the
fewest
systemic
side
effects
.

Some
suppression
of
overnight
cortisol
levels
has
been
reported
with
fluticasone
propionate
(
indicative
of
hypothalamic
-
pituitary
-
adrenal
axis
suppression
)
.

A
novel
mutation
of
delta
-
aminolaevulinate
dehydratase
in
a
healthy
child
with
12
%
erythrocyte
enzyme
activity
.

Cloning
,
expression
and
phenotype
studies
of
the
defective
gene
for
delta
-
aminolaevulinate
dehydratase
(
ALAD
)
in
a
family
with
an
asymptomatic
girl
who
had
ALAD
deficiency
were
carried
out
.

The
proband
was
identified
by
neonatal
ALAD
screening
,
and
had
erythrocyte
ALAD
activity
at
12
%
of
the
normal
control
.

She
was
heterozygous
for
ALAD
deficiency
,
which
was
inherited
from
her
father
.

Nucleotide
sequence
analysis
of
the
cloned
ALAD
cDNA
revealed
C36
to
G
and
T168
to
C
mutations
on
the
same
allele
.

The
former
mutation
resulted
in
F12L
substitution
,
whereas
the
latter
was
a
silent
mutation
.

All
family
members
who
had
decreased
ALAD
activity
had
the
same
mutation
.

Expression
of
the
mutant
ALAD
cDNA
in
Chinese
hamster
ovary
cells
produced
an
ALAD
protein
without
significant
enzyme
activity
.

Additionally
,
the
mutant
ALAD
cDNA
which
encodes
F12L
substitution
produced
an
aberrant
migration
pattern
in
polyacrylamide
gel
electrophoresis
under
denaturing
conditions
.

This
finding
probably
reflects
an
abnormal
folding
of
the
F12L
protein
,
since
the
mutation
occurred
in
the
alpha1
helix
of
the
N
-
terminal
arm
of
the
enzyme
,
which
is
involved
in
the
extensive
quaternary
interactions
among
the
subunits
.

This
is
also
the
first
report
of
ALAD
gene
mutation
in
an
asymptomatic
subject
.

Tamsulosin
:
assessment
of
affinityof
(

)
H
-
P
razosin
binding
to
two
alpha
-
1
-
adrenoceptor
subtypes
in
the
canine
aorta
.

This
study
was
performed
to
assess
the
affinity
of
tamsulosin
to
the
alpha
(
1L
)
-
in
addition
to
alpha
(
1B
)
-
adrenoceptor
(
alpha
(
1
)
-
AR
)
subtypes
coexisting
in
the
canine
aorta
using
the
radioligand
binding
assay
.

The
antagonistic
effects
of
this
drug
on
contraction
of
the
rat
aorta
were
also
assessed
,
and
the
results
were
compared
with
those
obtained
with
prazosin
,
amosulalol
,
labetalol
,
ketanserin
,
clonidine
and
propranolol
.

The
pKi
value
of
tamsulosin
to
the
alpha
(
1L
)
-
subtype
was
lower
than
those
of
prazosin
and
HV
-
723
,
but
higher
than
those
of
amosulalol
,
ketanserin
and
labetalol
.

The
pKi
value
of
tamsulosin
for
the
alpha
(
1B
)
-
subtype
in
the
canine
aorta
was
similar
to
that
of
prazosin
.

However
,
this
drug
showed
a
higher
pKi
value
than
amosulalol
,
HV
-
723
,
labetalol
and
ketanserin
.

On
the
other
hand
,
the
order
of
inhibition
potencies
for
contraction
of
the
rat
aorta
by
phenylephrine
was
as
follows
:
prazosin
>
tamsulosin
>
amosulalol
>
HV
-
723
>
labetalol
>
ketanserin
>
clonidine
>
propranolol
.

Thus
,
although
the
affinity
of
tamsulosin
to
the
alpha
(
1B
)
-
AR
subtype
in
the
canine
aorta
was
as
high
as
that
in
the
bovine
prostate
reported
in
our
previous
study
,
the
affinity
(
pKi
7
.
87
)
of
this
drug
to
alpha
(
1L
)
-
AR
in
the
canine
aorta
was
lower
than
that
(
pKi
8
.
99
)
in
the
bovine
prostate
.

These
observations
suggested
that
the
pharmacological
potencies
of
tamsulosin
in
the
aorta
and
prostate
may
be
different
.

In

.

The
rate
and
extent
of
binding
of
methazolamide
to
human
erythrocytes
was
studied
in
vitro
.

All
experiments
were
carried
out
at
physiological
temperature
(
37
C
)
and
pH
(
7

)
.

Methazolamide
(
MTZ
)
buffer
concentrations
were
analyzed
by
HPLC
.

Distributional
equilibrium
between
buffer
and
washed
red
blood
cells
was
achieved
after
1
hr
.

Results
of
equilibrium
studies
were
consistent
with
two
classes
of
binding
sites
for
MTZ
within
the
erythrocyte
:
a
low
affinity

high
capacity
site
(
CA

)
and
a
high
affinity
,
low
capacity
site
(
CA

)
.

A

was

Based
upon
these
findings
,
kinetic
studies
were
performed
in
order
to
characterize
the
rate
of
drug
distribution
.

The
rate
of
erythrocyte
uptake
of
MTZ
was
mathematically
modeled
using
a
series
of
differential
equations
describing
drug
diffusion
across
the
red
blood
cell
membrane
and
subsequent
complexation
with
intracellular
binding
sites
.

The
model
assumed
that
penetration
of
MTZ
into
the
red
blood
cells
was
passive
but
drug
binding
to
the
carbonic
anhydrase
isozymes
was
not
instantaneous
.

Radioimmunotherapy
of

Hodgkin
'
s
lymphoma
with
zevalin
,
a
90Y

.

Approximately
55
,
400
new
cases
of
non

(
NHL
)
are
diagnosed
each
year
,
with
the
overall
prevalence
of
the
disease
now
estimated
to
be
243
,
000
.

Until
recently
,
treatment
alternatives
for
advanced
disease
included
chemotherapy
with

without

radiation
.

Based
on
the
results
of

,
the
chimeric

Rituximab
has
now
been
approved
by
the

.

Ibritumomab
,
the
murine
counterpart
to
Rituximab
,
radiolabeled
with
90Y
(
Zevalin
)
,
is
presently
being
evaluated
in
clinical

.

The
success
of
radioimmunotherapy
is
dependent
upon
the
appropriate
choice
of
antibody
,
isotope
,
and
chelator

linker
.

The
Ibritumomab
antibody
targets
the
CD20
antigen
.

The
antibody
is
covalently
bound
to
the
chelator

linker
tiuxetan
(

)
,
which
tightly
chelates
the

have
been
completed
in

.

The
overall

Reduction
of
oral
ethanol
self

in

by
monoamine
oxidase
inhibitors
.

Evidence
for
a
role
of
dopamine
and
serotonin
in
the
control
of
ethanol
intake
in
animals
suggests
that
monoamine
oxidase
(
MAO
)
inhibitors
,
which
increase
the
synaptic
availability
of
serotonin
and
dopamine
by
blocking
their
metabolism
,
might
have
efficacy
in
the
treatment
of
alcohol
dependence
.

The
aim
of
the
present
study
was
,
therefore
,
to
evaluate
several
MAO
inhibitors
for
their
capacity
to
affect
ethanol
self
-
administration
in
rats
trained
to
self

administer
ethanol
(

,
tranylcypromine
(

)
,
and
nialamide
(

,
decreased

.

The

,
befloxatone
(

,
and
the
irreversible
MAO
-
A
inhibitor
,
clorgyline
(
10
-
30
mg

)
,
also
reduced
ethanol
self

administration
.

However
,
befloxatone

induced
effects
leveled
off
at
a
50
%
decrease
.

The
irreversible
MAO

inhibitors
,
pargyline
(
30
mg

)
and
l
-
deprenyl
(
3

10
mg
/

)
also
decreased
responding
maintained
by
ethanol
reinforcement
;
these
results
are
consistent
with
previous
findings
that
both
drugs
decreased
ethanol
intake
in
mice
.

In
conclusion
,
the
present
results
showing
that
several
MAO
inhibitors
decreased
ethanol
self
-
administration
in
rats
are
consistent
with
previous
findings
that
synaptic
levels
of
serotonin
and
dopamine
play
a
critical
role
in
the
control
of
ethanol
self

administration
.

Regulation
of
gene
expression
by
activation
of
the
peroxisome
proliferator
-
activated
receptor
gamma
with
rosiglitazone
(
BRL

)
in
human
adipocytes
.

To
better
define
the
mechanism
of
action
of
the
thiazolidinediones
,
we
incubated
freshly
isolated
human
adipocytes
with
rosiglitazone
and
investigated
the
changes
in
mRNA
expression
of
genes
encoding
key
proteins
of
adipose
tissue
functions
.

Rosiglitazone
(
10
(
-

)

,

)
increased
p85alphaphosphatidylinositol
3

kinase
(
p85alphaPI
-
3K
)
and
uncoupling
protein
-
2
mRNA
levels
and
decreased
leptin
expression
.

The
mRNA
levels
of
insulin
receptor
,

,
Glut

protein
-

,
angiotensinogen
,
plasminogen
activator
inhibitor
-
1
,
and
PPARgamma1
and
gamma2
were
not
modified
by
rosiglitazone
treatment
.

Activation
of
RXR
,
the
partner
of
PPARgamma
,
in
the
presence
of
rosiglitazone
,
increased
further
p85alphaPI
-
3K
and
UCP2
mRNA
levels
and
produced
a
significant
augmentation
of
Glut
4
expression
.

Because
p85alphaPI
-
3K
is
a
major
component
of
insulin
action
,
the
induction
of
its
expression
might
explain
,
at
least
in
part
,
the
insulin
-
sensitizing
effect
of
the
thiazolidinediones
.

OBJECTIVE
:
To
determine
the
efficacy
and
safety
of
the
cyclooxygenase

,
rofecoxib
in

of
the
knee
.

METHODS
:
Rofecoxib
,
25

,
was
compared
with

,
multicenter
study
of
219
patients

RESULTS
:
Both

Clinical
improvement
with
the
25

dose
was
similar
to
that
with
the
125
mg
dose
.

Both
rofecoxib
doses
were
generally
well
tolerated
.

CONCLUSION
:
Specific
inhibition
of
COX
-
2
by
25
and
125
mg
rofecoxib
,
administered
once
daily
,
resulted
in
clinically
meaningful
improvements
in
patients
with
OA
.

This
study
confirms
that
COX
-
2
derived
prostanoids
are
important
clinical
mediators
of
pain
and
other
symptoms
of
knee
OA
and
that
inhibition
of
COX
-
1
is
not
required
to
provide
clinical
benefit
.

Decreased
intracellular
proteolysis
correlates
with
the
maintenance
of
a
specific
isoenzyme
of
cytochrome
P
-
450
.

The
rates
of
intracellular
protein
degradation
,
of
identically
labelled
populations
of
proteins
,
were
compared
in
hepatocytes
cultured
at
37
degrees
(
on
an
adsorbed
collagen
layer
)
and
in
cells
preserved
on
gelatin
gels
at
10
degrees
C
.

The

of
the

(
N

)
respectively
.

Proteolysis
was
substantially
decreased
at
10
degrees
C
but
the
rate
of
decrease
remained
constant
.

Hepatocytes
rapidly
removed
resorufin
from
the
culture
medium
.

The
resorufin
was
not
being
conjugated
or
accumulated
within
the
cells
.

Dicumarol
,
a
potent
inhibitor
of
quinone
oxidoreductase
,
at
high
concentration
(
500
microm
)
caused
only
a
72
%
decrease
in
the
utilization
of
resorufin
.

The
microsomal
detoxifying
enzyme
,
cytochrome
P
-
450
1A1
remained
at
a
constant
level
in
the
preserved
hepatocyte
monolayers
.

The
results
of
this
study
strongly
favour
storing
hepatocytes
at
10
degrees
C
rather
than
at
4
degrees
or
37
degrees
C
.

Comparison

,
in

.

Pain
is
a
common
complaint
,
often
occurring
in
conjunction
with
inflammation
.

Nonsteroidal
anti
-
inflammatory
drugs
(
NSAIDs
)
are
the
most
commonly
used
analgesic
agents
in
ambulatory
patients
.

In
recent
studies
,
the
cyclooxygenase
-
2
(
COX
-
2
)
inhibitor
rofecoxib
demonstrated
analgesic
effects
similar
to
those
of
NSAIDs
in
the
treatment
of
acute
pain
and
primary
dysmenorrhea
.

The
present
randomized

,
double

dummy
,
placebo

and
active

group
study
was
undertaken
to
compare
the
analgesic
efficacy
of
the
COX

inhibitors
rofecoxib
50
mg
and
celecoxib
200
mg
with
that
of
ibuprofen
400
mg
and
placebo
in
patients
with
postoperative
dental

.

Two
hundred
and
seventy
-
two
patients
experiencing
pain
after
the
removal
of

were
randomized
according
to
pain
severity
(
moderate

)
to
receive
a
single
dose
of
placebo
(
n

)
,
rofecoxib
50
mg
(
n
=

)
,
celecoxib
200
mg
(
n

)
,
or
ibuprofen
400
mg
(
n
=
46
)
.

Using
a
patient
diary
,
patients
recorded
pain
intensity
,
pain
relief
,
and
global
evaluations
throughout
the
24

period
after
dosing
.

The
overall
analgesic
effect
,
onset
of
action
,
peak
effect
,
and
duration
of
effect
were
evaluated
,
with
the
primary
end
point
being
total
pain
relief
over
8
hours
(
TOPAR8
)
.

The
safety
profile
was
assessed
on
the
basis
of
physical
findings
,
laboratory
results
,
and
spontaneous
reports
of
adverse
experiences
.

The
results
showed
that
compared
with
celecoxib
,
rofecoxib
had
superior
analgesic
effects
on
all
measures
of
analgesic
efficacy
,
including
overall
analgesic
effect
(
TOPAR8

,
time
to

(

;
P

)
,
peak

(

,
and

of

(

;
P
<

.
001
)
.

In
addition
,
rofecoxib
'
s
analgesic
efficacy
was
similar
to
that
of
ibuprofen
(
TOPAR8
,
18
.
3
vs
.
17
.
0
;
P
=

)
,
but
the
duration
was
longer
(
P
<

.
05
)
;
with
ibuprofen
,
the
time
to
on
set
was
24
minutes
,
peak
pain
relief
score
was
2
.
9
,
and
duration
of
analgesic
effect
was
8
.
9
hours
.

The
safety
profile
was
similar
across
all
treatment
groups
.

Thus
rofecoxib
provided
analgesic
efficacy
superior
to
that
of
celecoxib
and
comparable
to
that
of
ibuprofen
in
the
treatment
of
patients
with
acute
postoperative
dental
pain
.

Natriuretic
response
to
increased

inhibitors
.

Elevation
of
renal
interstitial
hydrostatic
pressure
(
RIHP
)
by
direct
renal
interstitial
volume
expansion
increases
sodium
excretion
.

This
natriuretic
response
is
blunted
by
the
nonspecific
inhibition
of
the
cyclooxygenase
(
COX
)
enzymes
.

The
present
study
tested
the
hypothesis
that
the
natriuretic
response
to
increased
RIHP
during
direct
renal
interstitial
volume
expansion
is
dependent
on
COX

but
not
COX

RIHP

In

In

has
been
previously
shown
to

The

of
Gb
(

for
the
signal

of
IFN

is
now
reported
.

IFN

nuclear

,
and
increased

were
defective
in

,
although
the
surface
expression
of
IFNAR1
was
unaltered
.

The

subunit
was
found
to
inhibit
IFN

,
Stat1

and
PKR

.

Unlike
VT1
cytotoxicity
,
IFN

induced
Stat1
nuclear

was
not
inhibited
when
RME
was
prevented
,
suggesting
that
the
accessory

Inhibition
of

We
propose
that
the
long

preferentially
remain
in
the
plasma
membrane
,
and
by
associating
with

mediate

,
whereas
short

are
preferentially
internalized
to
mediate
VT1
cytotoxicity
and

Na

this

The

The

have
acquired
a
typical

indicated
by
:

Loss

The

inhibited
the

These
control

indicate
that
the
apparent

acquired
by
the

was
not
merely
associated
with
the
process

rather
with

In

of
the

the

.

The

was
reversible
,
as
removal

Taken
together
,
these
results
propose
that
the
NKCC1
gene
is
involved
in
the
control
of
normal

proliferation
,
while
its

results
in

Effects
of
chronic
antidepressant
treatments
on
serotonin
transporter
function
,
density
,
and
mRNA
level
.

To
investigate
functional
changes
in
the
brain
serotonin
transporter
(
SERT
)
after
chronic
antidepressant
treatment
,
several
techniques
were
used
to
assess
SERT
activity
,
density
,
or
its
mRNA
content
.

Rats
were
treated
by
osmotic
minipump
for
21
d
with
the
selective
serotonin
reuptake
inhibitors
(
SSRIs
)
paroxetine
or
sertraline
,
the
selective
norepinephrine
reuptake
inhibitor
desipramine
(
DMI
)
,
or
the
monoamine
oxidase
inhibitor
phenelzine
.

High
-
speed
in
vivo
electrochemical
recordings
were
used
to
assess
the
ability
of
the
SSRI
fluvoxamine
to
modulate
the
clearance
of
locally
applied
serotonin
in
the
CA3
region
of
hippocampus
in
drug
-
or
vehicle
-
treated
rats
.

Fluvoxamine
decreased
the
clearance
of
serotonin
in
rats
treated
with
vehicle
,
DMI
,
or
phenelzine
but
had
no
effect
on
the
clearance
of
serotonin
in
SSRI
-
treated
rats
.

SERT
density
in
the
CA3
region
of
the
hippocampus
of
the
same
rats
,
assessed
by
quantitative
autoradiography
with
tritiated
cyanoimipramine
(
[
(
3
)
H
]
CN
-
IMI
)
,
was
decreased
by
80
-
90
%
in
SSRI
-
treated
rats
but
not
in
those
treated
with
phenelzine
or
DMI
.

The
serotonin
content
of
the
hippocampus
was
unaffected
by
paroxetine
or
sertraline
treatment
,
ruling
out
neurotoxicity
as
a
possible
explanation
for
the
SSRI
-
induced
decrease
in
SERT
binding
and
alteration
in
5
-
HT
clearance
.

Levels
of
mRNA
for
the
SERT
in
the
raphe
nucleus
were
also
unaltered
by
chronic
paroxetine
treatment
.

Based
on
these
results
,
it
appears
that
the
SERT
is
downregulated
by
chronic
administration
of
SSRIs
but
not
other
types
of
antidepressants
;
furthermore
,
the
downregulation
is
not
caused
by
decreases
in
SERT
gene
expression
.

A
novel

of
the

specific
gamma

Aminolevulinate
synthase
gene
in
a
patient
with
non

.

A
novel
missense
mutation
,
G663A
,
in
exon
5
of
the
erythroid

specific
delta
-
aminolevulinate
synthase
gene
(
ALAS2
)
was
identified
in
a
Japanese
male
with
pyridoxine
-
responsive
sideroblastic
anemia
.

Activity
of
the
mutant
delta
-
aminolevulinate
synthase
protein
expressed
in

was
15
.
1
%
compared
with
the
normal
control
,
but
was
increased
up
to
34
.
5
%
by
the
addition
of
pyridoxal
5
'
-
phosphate
,
consistent
with
the
clinical
response
of
the
patient
to
pyridoxine
treatment
.

The
same
mutation
was
also
detected
in
genomic
DNa
from
the
oral
mucosal
membrane
of
the
patiet
;
however
,
it
was
not
detected
in
other
family
member
.

These
findings
suggest
that
this
G663A
mutation
is
responsible
for
sideroblastic
anemia
in
the
proband
,
and
may
be
an
index

in

This

sought
to
examine
the
feasibility
of
prolonged
assessment
of
acetylcholinesterase
(
AChE
)
activity
in
the
cerebrospinal

and
to
test
the
hypothesis
that
rivastigmine
(
ENA

,
Novartis
Pharma
AG
,
Basel
,
Switzerland
)
selectively
inhibits
AChE
in
CSF
in
humans
at
a
dose
producing
minimal
inhibition
of
the

.

Lumbar

from
eight
healthy

who
took
either

.

CSF

were
performed
23

Only
minimal

of
erythrocyte
AChE
activity
(
approximately
3
%
)
was
observed
.

Inhibition
of
AChE
in
the
CSF
after
rivastigmine
administration
was
significantly
greater
than
after
placebo
for
up
to
8

after
the

and
was
maximal
(

.

Plasma
BuChE
activity
was
significantly
lower
after
rivastigmine
than
after
placebo
,
but
this
was
not
clinically
relevant
.

BuChE
activity
in
CSF
was
significantly
lower
after
rivastigmine
than
after
placebo
for
up
to
3

6
hours
after
dosing
,
but
this
difference
was
not
sustained
.

This
study
confirms
the
feasibility
of
using
continuous
measurement
of
AChE
activity
in
CSF
over
prolonged
periods
,
that
rivastigmine
markedly
inhibits
CSF
AChE
after
a
single
oral
dose
of
3
mg
,
and
that
the
inhibition
of
central
AChE
is
substantially
greater
than
that
of
peripheral
AChE
or
BuChE
.

To

key
amino

involved
in
factor

activation
,
recombinant
factor

proteins
containing
alanine
substitutions
for
wild

type
sequence
were
expressed
in

fibroblasts
and
tested
in
a

at

and
for
Ser
(

-
Ser
(
264
)
at
the
C
terminus
of
the
A3
domain
markedly
decreased
factor

coagulant
activity
.

The
plasma
protease
prekallikrein
is
structurally
homologous
to
factor
XI
,
but
activated
factor

poorly
.

A
chimeric
factor

molecule
with
the

replaced
with
A3
from
prekallikrein
(

with
a
K

fold
greater
than
that
of
wild

type
factor
XI
.

FXI
/
PKA3
was
used
as
a
template
for
a
series
of
proteins
in
which
prekallikrein
A3
sequence
was
replaced
with
factor
XI
sequence
to
restore
factor
IX
activation
.

Clotting
and
kinetics
studies
using
these
chimeras
confirmed
the
results
obtained
with
alanine
mutants
.

Amino
acids
between
Ile
(
183
)
and
Val
(
191

are
necessary
for
proper
factor

activation
,
but
additional

and
Ile
(

between
Phe

Vasopeptidase
inhibition
with
omapatrilat
improves
cardiac
geometry
and
survival
in
cardiomyopathic
hamsters
more
than
does
ACE
inhibition
with
captopril
.

Vasopeptidase
inhibitors
are
single
molecules
that
inhibit
neutral
endopeptidase
(
NEP
)
and
angiotensin
-
converting
enzyme
(
ACE
)
simultaneously
.

Omapatrilat
,
the
first
in
this
new
class
of
cardiovascular
agents
,
potentiates
vasodilatory
and
cardioprotective
peptides
and
represses
angiotensin

.

This
study
compared
the
effects
of
omapatrilat
with
those
of
a
pure
ACE
inhibitor
on
cardiac
geometry
and
survival
in
animals
with

.

BIO
TO
-
2
cardiomyopathic
hamsters
(
CMHs
)
in
the
early
stages
of
dilated
heart
failure
were
treated
with
vehicle
or
maximal
ACE
inhibitory
doses
of
captopril
(
750
micromol
/
kg
/
day
)
or
omapatrilat
(
200
micromol
/
kg
/
day
)
.

Prolonged
vasopeptidase
inhibition
increased
median
survival
time
after
the
start
of
treatment
by
99
and
31
%
compared
with
vehicle
and
captopril
,
respectively
(
median
survival
times
:
146
,
221
,
and
290
days
with
vehicle
,
captopril
,
and
omapatrilat
,
respectively
;
p
<
0
.
001
for
all
comparisons
)
.

In
similar
CMHs
,
captopril
or
omapatrilat
administered
for
2
months
significantly
(
p
<
0
.
05
)
decreased
heart
weight
,
pulmonary
congestion
(
lung
weight
)
,
and
left
ventricular
(
LV
)
chamber
volume
compared
with
vehicle
.

Omapatrilat
significantly
increased
LV
mass
-
to
-
volume
ratio
compared
with
vehicle
and
captopril
.

Omapatrilat
,
but
not
captopril
,
significantly
increased
urinary
atrial
natriuretic
peptide
excretion
,
indicating
NEP
inhibition
.

Thus
vasopeptidase
inhibition
with
omapatrilat
was
more
effective
than
ACE
inhibition
with
captopril
in
preventing
changes
in
LV
geometry
and
premature
mortality
in
hamsters
with
dilated
heart

In
this
study
,
two
different
contraceptive
regimes
(
Mircette
,
a
monophasic
oral
contraceptive
and
Implanon
,
a
long

were
used
and
their

(
VEGF
)
,
oestrogen

,
progesterone

were
determined
.

During
the
untreated
normal
cycle
,
there
was
a
significant
increase
(
P

005
)
in
glandular
VEGF
immunoreactivity
and
a
significant
decrease
(
P

.
05
)
in
PR
immunoreactivity
in
the
mid

and
late
secretory
phases
compared
with
the
proliferative
phase
.

There
was
a
significant
positive
correlation
(
gamma

.
38
,
P
=
0
.
046
)
between
stromal
VEGF
immunoreactivity
and
endothelial
cell
number
.

This
correlation
was
also
apparent
during
treatment
with
Implanon
,
but
not
with
Mircette
.

Disrupted
bleeding
patterns
were
associated
with
Implanon
and
,
to
a
lesser
extent
,
with
Mircette
.

Both
contraceptives
significantly
reduced
glandular
VEGF
immunoreactivity
.

Implanon
significantly
increased
(
P

)
glandular

,
but
Mircette
significantly
reduced
(
P

)
stromal

when
compared
with
secretory

.

There
were
no

ER
during
the
normal

,
or
with
use

Herein

we

AR

,
yohimbine
,
as
compared
to

,
at

examine
their

in
the

.

In

yohimbine

antagonist
actions

and

(

)
sites
,
yet
partial
agonist
actions
at
h5
-
HT
(
1A
)
sites
.

In
vivo
,
agonist
actions
of
yohimbine
at
5
-
HT
(
1A
)
sites
are
revealed
by
WAY100
,
635
-
reversible
induction
of
hypothermia
in
the
rat
.

In
guinea
pigs
,
antagonist
actions
of
yohimbine
at
5
-
HT
(
1B
)
receptors
are
revealed
by
blockade
of
hypothermia
evoked
by
the
5
-
HT
(
1B
)
agonist
,
GR46
,
611
.

In
distinction
to
yohimbine
,
fluparoxan
shows
only
modest
partial
agonist
actions
at
h5
-
HT
(
1A
)
sites
versus
marked
antagonist
actions
at
halpha
(
2
)
-
ARs
.

While
fluparoxan
selectively
enhances
hippocampal
noradrenaline
(
NAD
)
turnover
,
yohimbine
also
enhances
striatal
dopamine
(
DA
)
turnover
and
suppresses
striatal
turnover
of
5
-
HT
.

Further
,
yohimbine
decreases
firing
of
serotonergic
neurones
in
raphe
nuclei
,
an
action
reversed
by
WAY100
,
635
.

Fluparoxan
increases
extracellular
levels
of
DA
and
NAD
,
but
not
5
-
HT
,
in
frontal
cortex
.

In
analogy
,
yohimbine
enhances
FCX
levels
of
DA
and
NAD
,
yet
suppresses
those
of
5
-
HT
,
the
latter
effect
being
antagonized
by
WAY100
,
635
.

The
induction
by
fluoxetine
of
FCX
levels
of
5
-
HT
,
DA
,
and
NAD
is
potentiated
by
fluparoxan
.

Yohimbine
likewise
facilitates
the
influence
of
fluoxetine
upon
DA
and
NAD
levels
,
but
not
those
of
5
-
HT
.

In
conclusion
,
the
alpha
(
2
)
-
AR
antagonist
properties
of
yohimbine
increase
DA
and
NAD
levels
both
alone
and
in
association
with
fluoxetine
.

However
,
in
contrast
to
the
selective
alpha
(
2
)
-
AR
antagonist
,
fluparoxan
,
the
5
-
HT
(
1A
)
agonist
actions
of
yohimbine
suppress
5
-
HT
levels
alone
and
underlie
its
inability
to
augment
the
influence
of
fluoxetine
upon
5
-
HT
levels
.

Pharmacological
and
ocular
hypotensive
properties
of
topical
carbonic
anhydrase
inhibitors
.

There
was
a
time
gap
of
over
40
years
between
the
demonstrated
oral
effectiveness
of
acetazolamide
in
lowering
the
intraocular
pressure
(
IOP
)
of
glaucoma
patients
and
the
introduction
of
a
topical
carbonic
anhydrase
(
CA
)
inhibitor
.

This
is
due
to
the
fact
that
CA
-
II
,
the
isoenzyme
which
most
likely
plays
an
important
role
in
the
production
of
aqueous
humor
in
humans
,
must
be
essentially
inhibited
by
100
%
to
elicit
a
pharmacological
response
.

The
lack
of
success
with
earlier
attempts
to
obtain
a
topical
agent
stems
from
an
inability
to
attain
and
maintain
a
sufficiently
high
intraocular
concentration
of
drug
to
achieve
the
required
inhibition
of
CA
.

Dorzolamide
and
brinzolamide
are
two
topical
CA
inhibitors
which
are
currently
available
to
treat
ocular
hypertension
and
/
or
glaucoma
.

Dorzolamide
is
a
very
potent
inhibitor
of
CA
-
II
and
its
site
of
action
is
local
within
the
eye
.

Like
oral
CA
inhibitors
,
topically
applied
dorzolamide
lowers
IOP
by
decreasing
the
production
of
aqueous
humor
.

The
drug
is
used
in
monotherapy
as
a
2
%
solution
administered
three
times
daily
.

Its
ocular
hypotensive
effect
is
comparable
to
that
of
timolol
at
peak
but
is
somewhat
less
at
trough
.

The
IOP
lowering
effect
of
timolol
is
enhanced
by
the
twice
daily
administration
of
2
%
dorzolamide
either
concomitantly
or
in
combination
.

Topically
applied
dorzolamide
is
generally
well
tolerated
and
had
a
low
drop
-
out
rate
in
clinical
studies
.

The
most
frequent
ocular
adverse
experience
is
burning
and
/
or
stinging
.

Corneal
and
lenticular
problems
have
generally
not
been
encountered
with
long
-
term
therapy
with
dorzolamide
.

Topically
applied
dorzolamide
penetrates
directly
to
the
posterior
segment
of
the
eye
and
its
presence
is
consistent
with
the
initial
report
that
dorzolamide
increases
retinal
blood
flow
velocity
in
patients
with
normal
tension
glaucoma
.

The
most
frequent
systemic
adverse
experience
is
a
transient
bitter
taste
.

Biochemical
changes
indicative
of
the
systemic
inhibition
of
CA
have
not
been
observed
in
monotherapy
studies
lasting
up
to
2
years
.

This
is
in
harmony
with
the
inability
of
dorzolamide
at
steady
-
state
to
saturate
CA
in
the
red
blood
cell
and
the
failure
to
detect
its
presence
in
plasma
.

A
1
%
suspension
of
brinzolamide
is
comparable
to
2
%
dorzolamide
in
lowering
IOP
,
both
drugs
being
administered
three
times
daily
.

Although
brinzolamide
has
a
lower
incidence
of
burning
/
stinging
,
it
elicits
more
blurred
vision
.

Microvessel
density
and
endothelial
cell
proliferation
after
amifostine
(
Ethyol
)
administration
in
vivo
.

BACKGROUND
:
As
amifostine
is
rapidly
metabolised
by
the
membrane
-
bound
and
capillary
alkaline
phosphatase
to
the
active
metabolite
WR
-
1065
,
microvessel
density
in
normal
and
cancer
tissue
may
influence
the
therapeutic
potential
of
the
pro
-
drug
WR
-
2721
.

Thus
,
it
is
of
interest
how
the
administration
of
amifostine
itself
alters
vascular
density
.

MATERIALS
AND
METHOD
:
For
this
study
fertilized
eggs
were
used
and
0

05
ml
amifostine
(

,
48

the

.

Applying
the
LAB
method
we
performed
immunohistochemical

.

RESULTS
:
There
was
a

difference
in
vascular

CONCLUSION
:
A

Biochemically
based
design
of
cyclooxygenase

2
(
COX

2
)
inhibitors
:
facile
conversion
of
nonsteroidal
antiinflammatory
drugs
to
potent
and
highly
selective
COX
-
2
inhibitors
.

All
nonsteroidal
antiinflammatory
drugs
(
NSAIDs
)
inhibit
the
cyclooxygenase
(
COX
)
isozymes
to
different
extents
,
which
accounts
for
their
anti
-
inflammatory
and
analgesic
activities
and
their
gastrointestinal
side
effects
.

We
have
exploited
biochemical
differences
between
the
two
COX
enzymes
to
identify
a
strategy
for
converting
carboxylate
-
containing
NSAIDs
into
selective
COX
-
2
inhibitors
.

Derivatization
of
the
carboxylate
moiety
in
moderately
selective
COX
-
1
inhibitors
,
such
as
5
,
8
,
11
,
14
-
eicosatetraynoic
acid
(
ETYA
)
and
arylacetic
and
fenamic
acid
NSAIDs
,
exemplified
by
indomethacin
and
meclofenamic
acid
,
respectively
,
generated
potent
and
selective
COX
-
2
inhibitors
.

In
the
indomethacin
series
,
esters
and
primary
and
secondary
amides
are
superior
to
tertiary
amides
as
selective
inhibitors
.

Only
the
amide
derivatives
of
ETYA
and
meclofenamic
acid
inhibit
COX
-
2
;
the
esters
are
either
inactive
or
nonselective
.

Inhibition
kinetics
reveal
that
indomethacin
amides
behave
as
slow
,
tight
-
binding
inhibitors
of
COX
-
2
and
that
selectivity
is
a
function
of
the
time
-
dependent
step
.

Site
-
directed
mutagenesis
of
murine
COX
-
2
indicates
that
the
molecular
basis
for
selectivity
differs
from
the
parent
NSAIDs
and
from
diarylheterocycles
.

Selectivity
arises
from
novel
interactions
at
the
opening
and
at
the
apex
of
the
substrate
-
binding
site
.

Lead
compounds
in
the
present
study
are
potent
inhibitors
of
COX
-
2
activity
in
cultured
inflammatory
cells
.

that

COX

-
specific
inhibition
:
implications
for
clinical
practice
.

Although
conventional
nonsteroidal
anti
-
inflammatory
drugs
(
NSAIDs
)
have
long
been
a
major
therapeutic
choice
for
the
management
of
arthritic
conditions
,
the
potential
adverse
effects
of
these
agents
sometimes
compromise
their
clinical
utility
.

New
modes
of
therapy
have
recently
been
introduced
,
and
data
on
the
cyclooxygenase
-
2
(
COX
-
2
)
-
specific
inhibitors
celecoxib
and
rofecoxib
suggest
that
these
agents
will
meet
the
need
for
safe
and
effective
therapeutic
alternatives
to
conventional
NSAIDs
.

A
review
of
recent
advances
on
the
regulation
of
pigmentation
in
the
human
epidermis
.

It
has
been
recognised
that
the
active
transport
of
L
-
phenylalanine
and
its
autocrine
turnover
to
L
-
tyrosine
via
phenylalanine
hydroxylase
in
the
cytosol
of
epidermal
melanocytes
provides
the
majority
of
the
L
-
tyrosine
pool
for
melanogenesis
.

In
this
context
,
it
has
been
shown
that
the
cofactor
6
(
R
)
-
L
-
erythro
5
,
6
,
7
,
8
tetrahydrobiopterin
(
6BH4
)
is
produced
de
novo
,
recycled
and
regulated
in
both
epidermal
melanocytes
and
keratinocytes
to
control
tyrosine
hydroxylase
,
phenylalanine
hydroxylase
and
tyrosinase
activity
.

Inhibition
of
the
enzymes
by
excessive
6BH4
levels
is
reversible
with
alpha
-
MSH
by
specific
complex
formation
between
6BH4
and
the
hormone
.

This
direct
mechanism
of
alpha
-
MSH
is
supported
by
the
presence
of
the
entire
POMC
processing
system
in
the
melanosome
indicating
a
receptor
independent
control
of
eumelanogenesis
.

Finally
,
the
role
of
tyrosinase
,
TRP
-
1
and
TRP2
is
discussed
in
association
with
oxidative
stress
specifically
related
to
hydrogen
peroxide
.

These
recent
findings
are
based
on
detailed
investigations
of
the
depigmentation
disorder

and

examined
the

in
the

We
also
determined

is
involved
.

,
resting

express
mRNAs
for

Levels
of
mRNA
for

were
unchanged
from

after

incubation
with

To
examine
the
role
of
Cox
,
the
cultures
were
also
treated
with
resveratrol
(
a
specific

of
Cox

)
,
NS

(
a

,
or

typical
of

(

D
(

.

In
contrast
,
inhibition

,
indicating
that
24R

(

D
(

exerts
its
effects
via

.

Inclusion
of
resveratrol
reduced
the
melittin

inhibition
of
PLA
(

and
caused
an
increase
in

activity
.

Metabolism

in
the
response
to
24R
,
25
-
(
OH

(

D
(

because
inhibition

.

The
effect
of
24R
,
25
-
(
OH

(

was
specific
because

)
D
(

)
,
the
biologically
inactive
stereoisomer
,
failed
to
elicit
a

.

These
results
support
the
hypothesis
that
24R
,
25
-
(
OH
)
(
2
)
D
(
3

exerts
its
effects
via
more
than

that
these
pathways
are
interrelated
via
the

Local

of
ganirelix
administered
by

were
compared
.

Additionally
,
the
pharmacodynamic

Two

once

for
7
days
by

in
a

,
without

.

No
apparent
differences
in
local

were
observed
.

Most
injections
(
87

5
%
)
gave
either
no
or
only
a
mild
reaction
.

Of
the
moderate

were
reported
most
frequently
(

,
respectively
)
.

Administration
by

was
bioequivalent
to
conventional

with
respect
to
the
peak
concentration
and
area
under
the
curve
.

A
profound
suppression
of
luteinizing

was
observed
.

Serum
oestradiol
and
progesterone
concentrations
were
relatively
low
prior
to

and
remained

In
conclusion
,
administration
of

catalyzes
the

for
isoxazol

,
which

.

Despite

,
there
have
been
no
comparative

Here
,
we
describe
a
study
of
the
inhibition
of
the
purified

by
ten
compounds
.

1

naphthoquinone
and
the
natural
compounds
juglon

)
were
found
to
function
as
alternative
electron
acceptors
with
10
-
30
%
of
control
enzyme
activity
.

The
human
and
rat
enzyme
activity
was
decreased
by
50
%
by
the
natural
compound
lawsone
(

and
atovaquone
(

.

With

to
the

of
the
dihydroorotate

,
atovaquone
(

and
dichloroally

were
shown
to
be
competitive
inhibitors
of
human

.

Atovaquone
(
Kic

nM
)
was
also
acompetitive
inhibitor
of
the
rat

.

Dichloroally

was
found
to
be
a

of
the
rat

,
with
the
lowest

(
Ki

determined
so

for
mammalian

Another

of
this
potent
inhibitor
(

)
with
the
human

were

and
seen
to

of
the
reasons
for
the
narrow
therapeutic
window
(

versus

)
reported
from
clinical
trials
on
its
antiproliferative
and
immunosuppressive
action
.

With

,
atovaquone
was
an
uncompetitive
inhibitor
of
human
dihydroorotate

(

and
a

New
prospects
in
the
treatment
of
migraine
]
.

The
options
for
migraine
treatment
have
increased
in
the
recent
years
and
will
expand
in
the
near
future
.

In
this
work
both
recent
and
future
options
for
migraine
treatment
are
critically
reviewed
.

Firstly
the
late
advances
in
the
symptomatic
treatment
of
migraine
,
including
the
new
5
-
HT1B
/
D
agonists
"
triptans
"
appeared
after
sumatriptan
,
are
reviewed
.

Possible
alternative
,
such
as
selective
5
-
HT1D
and
5
-
HT1F
agonists
,
are
also
discussed
.

In
the
second
part
of
this
manuscript
the
new
,
possible
options
for
the
preventive
treatment
of
migraine
comprising
"
antiepileptics
"
,
such
as
valproic
acid
,
gabapentin
and
topiramate
,
calcium
-
antagonists
,
such
as
cyclandelate
and
dotarizin
,
and
a
miscellany
,
including
riboflavin
,
are
analysed
.

Finally
,
possible
compounds
for
the
future
,
such
as
the
selective
inhibitors
of
neurokinin
receptors
or
drugs
acting
upon
neuronal
calcium
channels
,
are
commented
.

From
this
review
we
conclude
that
while
there
have
been
relevant
advances
in
the
symptomatic
treatment
of
migraine
,
there
is
a
need
for
the
development
of
better
preventive
compounds
.

Sodium

in
patients
with

.

BACKGROUND
:
A
mutation
in
the
cardiac
sodium
channel
gene
(
SCN5A
)
has
been
described
in
patients
with
the
syndrome
of
right
bundle
branch
block
,
ST
-
segment
elevation
in
leads
V1
to
V3
,
and
sudden
death
(
Brugada
syndrome
)
.

These
electrocardiographic
manifestations
are
transient
in
many
patients
with
the
syndrome
.

The
present
study
examined
arrhythmic
risk
in
patients
with
overt
and
concealed
forms
of
the
disease
and
the
effectiveness
of
sodium
channel
blockers
to
unmask
the
syndrome
and
,
thus
,
identify
patients
at
risk
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
The
data
demonstrated
a
similar
incidence
of
potentially
lethal
arrhythmias
in
patients
displaying
transient
versus
persistent
ST
-
segment
elevation
and
right

,
as
well
as
the

and
,
thus
,
identify
patients
at

Determinants
of
voltage
-
dependent
inactivation
affect
Mibefradil
block
of
calcium
channels
.

The
voltage
gated
calcium
channel
family
is
a
major
target
for
a
range
of
therapeutic
drugs
.

Mibefradil
(
Ro
40
-
5967
)
belongs
to
a
new
chemical
class
of
these
molecules
which
differs
from
other
Ca2
+
antagonists
by
its
ability
to
potently
block
T
-
type
Ca2
+
channels
.

However
,
this
molecule
has
also
been
shown
to
inhibit
other
Ca2
+
channel
subtypes
.

To
further
analyze
the
mechanism
governing
the
Ca2
+
channel
-
Mibefradil
interaction
,
we
examined
the
effect
of
Mibefradil
on
various
recombinant
Ca2
+
channels
expressed
in
mammalian
cells
from
their
cloned
cDNAs
,
using
Ca2
+
as
the
permeant
ion
at
physiological
concentration
.

Expression
of
alpha1A
,
alpha1C
,
and
alpha1E
in
tsA
201
cells
resulted
in
Ca2
+
currents
with
functional
characteristics
closely
related
to
those
of
their
native
counterparts
.

Mibefradil
blocked
alpha1A
and
alpha1E
with
a
Kd
comparable
to
that
reported
for
T
-
type
channels
,
but
had
a
lower
affinity
(
approximately
30
-
fold
)
for
alpha1C
.

For
each
channel
,
inhibition
by
Mibefradil
was
consistent
with
high
-
affinity
binding
to
the
inactivated
state
.

Modulation
of
the
voltage
-
dependent
inactivation
properties
by
the
nature
of
the
coexpressed
beta
subunit
or
the
alpha1
splice
variant
altered
block
at
the
Mibefradil
receptor
site
.

Therefore
,
we
conclude
that
the
tissue
and
sub
-
cellular
localization
of
calcium
channel
subunits
as
well
as
their
specific
associations
are
essential
parameters
to
understand
the
in
vivo
effects
of
Mibefradil
.

The

FGF
has

We
studied
the

and
the

,

,
and

on

As

,
we
used
the
adrenal

,
whose
anchorage

Suramin
inhibited
FGF
at

.

The
polysulfated

exerted
no
effect
on

Suramin
inhibited

only
at
an
IC50
of
100

Our
results
indicate
that
suramin
inhibits
growth
factors
in
a
nonselective
way
.

By
contrast
,
polysulfated

exert
a

at
an
IC50
,
which
is
100
times

Therefore
,
the

Nitric

expression
in
the

superior
colliculus
:
a
histochemical
,
immunohistochemical

biochemical
study
.

The
expression
of
neuronal
nitric
oxide
synthase
(
nNOS
)
in
the
superior
colliculus
(
SC
)
of
the
opossum
Didelphis
marsupialis
was
studied
by
NADPH
diaphorase
(
NADPH
-
d
)
histochemistry
and
nNOS
immunohistochemistry
.

In
addition
,
the
activity
of
nNOS
was
quantified
by
measurement
of
[
(

H
]
-
L
-
arginine
conversion
to
[
(

H
]
-
L
-
citrulline
in
tissue
extracts
from
SC
superficial
layers
in
opossums
and
rats
.

Our
results
show
that
the
number
of
NADPH
-
d
stained
cells
was
small
and
virtually
identical
in
stratum
opticum
(
SO
)
and
stratum
griseum
superficiale
(
SGS
)
and
their
staining
was
very
light
,
particularly
in
SGS
.

Neuropil
staining
was
heavier
in
the
stratum
zonale
(
SZ
)
than
in
SGS
or
SO
.

The
intermediate
and
deep
layers
contained
heavily
stained
cells
and
moderate
neuropil

.

Surprisingly
,
nNOS

immunoreactive
cells
were
far
more
numerous
than

indicated
that
nNOS
specific
activity
is
as
high
in
the
opossum
as
in
the

.

Our
results
suggest
that
the
location

Correlations
between
serotonin
level
and
single
-
cell
firing
in
the
rat
'
s
nucleus
raphe
magnus
.

The
relation
between
serotonin
release
and
electrical
activity
was
examined
in
the
nucleus
raphe
magnus
of
rats
anesthetized
with
pentobarbital
.

Serotonin
levels
were
monitored
through
a
carbon
-
fiber
microelectrode
by
fast
cyclic
voltammetry
(
usually
at
1
Hz
)
.

Single
-
cell
firing
was
recorded
through
the
same
microelectrode
,
except
during
the
voltammetry
waveform
and
associated
electrical
artifact
(
totaling
about
30
ms
)
.

Multi
-
barrel
micropipettes
incorporating
the
voltammetry
electrode
were
used
for
iontophoresis
of
drugs
.

Cells
were
inhibited
,
excited
or
unaffected
by
noxious
mechanical
skin
stimulation
.

These
were
respectively
designated
as
off
(
M
)
cells
,
on
(
M
)
cells
and
neutral
(
M
)
cells
,
M
denoting
mechanical
.

During
3
min
of
pinching
,
serotonin
slowly
rose
near
seven
of
14
on
(
M
)
cells
and
26
of
46
off
(
M
)
cells
;
it
fell
near
two
off
(
M
)
cells
;
it
was
unchanged
near
all
other
cells
,
including
six
neutral
(
M
)
cells
.

On
a
finer
spatiotemporal
scale
,
near
four
of
seven
on
(
M
)
cells
,
10
of
14
off
(
M
)
cells
and
0
of
four
neutral
(
M
)
cells
,
average
serotonin
levels
fell
significantly
within
+
/
-
100
ms
of
spontaneous
spikes
.

Lower
serotonin
may
have
caused
the
higher
spike
probability
;
the
converse
is
theoretically
unlikely
,
since
delays
between
release
and
detection
are
estimated
to
exceed
100
ms
.

Increased
serotonin
and
decreased
firing
were
always
seen
following
iontophoresis
or
intravenous
injection
(
1
mg
/
kg
)
of
the
serotonin
re
-
uptake
inhibitor
clomipramine
(
n
=
7
)
.

Iontophoresis
of
+
/
-
propranolol
,
whose
serotonergic
actions
include
antagonism
and
partial
agonism
at
5
-
HT1
receptors
,
also
increased
serotonin
and
decreased
firing
(
n
=
4
)
.

Methiothepin
(
intravenous
,
1
mg
/
kg
)
,
whose
serotonergic
actions
include
5
-
HT1
and
5
-
HT2
antagonism
,
typically
raised
serotonin
levels
(
four
of
five
cells
)
and
always
blocked
inhibition
by
clomipramine
(
n
=
3
)
.

Iontophoresis
of
glutamate
always
lowered
serotonin
and
increased
firing
(
n
=
4
)
.

Since
serotonin
levels
and
firing
were
usually
inversely
correlated
,
except
near
on
(
M
)
cells
during
pinch
,
we
propose
that
serotonin
is
released
from
terminals
of
incoming
nociceptive
afferents
.

Prior
neuroanatomical
knowledge
favors
a
midbrain
origin
for
these
afferents
,
while
some
of
the
drug
findings
suggest
that
their
terminals
possess
inhibitory
serotonergic
autoreceptors
,
possibly
of
5
-
HT1b
subtype
.

The
released
serotonin
could
contribute
to
the
inhibition
of
off
(
M
)
cells
and
excitation
of
on
(
M
)
cells
by
noxious
stimulation
,
since
inhibitory
5
-
HT1a
receptors
and
excitatory
5
-
HT2
receptors
,
respectively
,
have
previously
been
shown
to
dominate
their
serotonergic
responses

A
rationale
for
treatment
with
marine
and

OBJECTIVE
:
To
assess
the
fatty
acid
pattern
in
plasma
and
synovial
fluid
(
SF
)
in
rheumatoid
arthritis
(
RA
)
and
to
determine
clinical
factors
related
to
possible
abnormalities
.

METHODS
:
Thirty
-
nine
patients
with
RA
were
included
.

SF
samples
were
obtained
from
9
patients
.

Disease
activity
was
assessed
using
the
Ritchie
Articular
Index
and
erythrocyte
sedimentation
rate
.

Fatty
acids
were
assayed
with
gas
liquid
chromatography
.

RESULT
:
Decreased
levels
of
eicosapentaenoic
acid
(
p
<
0
.
0001
)
and
total
n3
polyunsaturated
fatty
acids
(
p
<
0
.
05
)
were
observed
in
plasma
and
in
joint
fluid
,
respectively
.

An
increase
of
the
substrates
of
delta
-
5
-
desaturase
(
C20
:

and
C20
:
2n6
)
and
decrease
of
their
products
(
C20
:
4n6
and
C22
:
4n6
)
was
observed
in
plasma
total
lipids
and
phospholipids
.

The
long
chain
mono
-
unsaturated
fatty
acids
(
C20
:
1n9
,
C22
:
1n9
,
C24
:
ln9
)
were
increased
in
the
joint
fluid
and
in
plasma
phospholipids
.

Patients
with
active
disease
showed
a
mild
decrease
of
several
saturated
fatty
acids
,
n3
,
and
n6
polyunsaturated
fatty
acids
.

Minor
abnormalities
or
no
changes
in
fatty
acid
profile
were
found
related
to
use
of
steroids
,
nonsteroidal
antiinflammatory
drugs
,
and
gold
salts
,
or
malnutrition
.

CONCLUSION
:
The
fatty
acid
pattern
found
in
RA
(
decreased
levels
of
n3
polyunsaturated
fatty
acids
)
may
explain
the
beneficial
effect
of
fish
oil
.

Changes
in
n6
polyunsaturated
fatty
acids
suggest
that
delta
-
5
desaturation
is
decreased
and
this
might
facilitate
the
antiinflammatory
effect
of
botanical
lipids
in
RA
.

LAs
)
have
been
found
to
have
cocaine
-
like
characteristics
with
some
psychotomimetic
action
,
possibly
through
monoaminergic
neurotransmission
.

To
gain
insight
into
the
relation
between
LA
action
and
monoamine
transporters
,
we
investigated
the
effect
of
synthetic
LAs
on
neurotransmitter
transporters
,
including
monoamine
transporters
.

We
used
cloned
transporter
cDNAs
and
examined
transient
functional
expression
in
COS
cells
and
stable
expression
in
HeLa
cells
.

Among
the
LAs
tested
,
procaine
and
other
ester
-
type
LAs
inhibited
[
3H
]
DA
uptake
and
binding
of
[
3H
]
2
-
beta
-
carbomethoxy
-
3
-
beta
-
(
4
-
fluorophenyl
)
tropane
(
CFT
)
,
a
cocaine
analogue
,
in
COS
cells
expressing
rat
dopamine
transporter
(
DAT
)
.

The
inhibition
was
concentration
-
dependent
.

The
inhibitory
effect
on
[
3H
]
DA
uptake
was
reversible
and
not
dependent
on
pH
,
as
observed
in
HeLa
cells
stably
expressing
DAT
.

Procaine
also
inhibited
uptake
of
norepinephrine
(
NE
)
and
serotonin
(
5
-
HT
)
by
the
norepinephrine
transporter
(
NET
)
or
serotonin
transporter
(
SERT
)
expressed
in
COS
cells
.

On
the
other
hand
,
procaine
and
other
LAs
had
little
or
no
effect
on
[
3H
]
GABA
and
[
3H
]
glutamate
uptake
in
COS
cells
expressing
mouse
GABA
or
rat
glutamate
/
aspartate
transporter
.

IC50
values
for
[
3H
]
DA
uptake
inhibition
correlated
well
with
those
for
[
3H
]
CFT
binding
inhibition
,
but
not
with
intrinsic
anesthetic
potency
.

Kinetic
analysis
of
monoamine
uptake
inhibition
by
procaine
in
COS
cells
expressing
rat
DAT
,
NET
or
SERT
revealed
a
competitive
action
similar
to
that
of
cocaine
.

These
results
demonstrate
that
certain
LAs
selectively
inhibit
monoamine
transporters
.

This
might
contribute
to
the
cocaine
-
like
psychotomimetic
action
of
certain
LAs
.

Estrogen
receptor
-
alpha
gene
transfer
into
bovine
aortic
endothelial
cells
induces
eNOS
gene
expression
and
inhibits
cell
migration
.

OBJECTIVES
:
It
has
been
suggested
that
estrogen
may
improve
endothelial
cell
function
to
delay
the
onset
of
atherosclerosis
in
pre
-
menopausal
females
,
though
its
mechanism
of
action
is
not
fully
understood
.

We
examined
the
hypothesis
that
human
estrogen
receptor
-
alpha
(
ER
alpha
)
gene
transfection
improves
the
endothelial
cell
function
.

METHODS
:
A
replication
deficient
adenoviral
vector
was
used
to
transfect
the
ER
alpha
gene
into
bovine
aortic
endothelial
cells
(
BAEC
)
and
a
GFP
gene
containing
vector
was
used
as
control
.

Expression
of
the
eNOS
gene
was
determined
by
Northern
blot
analysis
and
enzyme
activity
assay
;
cell
migration
was
assayed
using
a
Transwell
apparatus
;
and
tyrosine
phosphorylation
of
FAK
was
estimated
by
Western
blot
analysis
.

RESULTS
:
ER
alpha
gene
transfection
of
endothelial
cells
produced
a
2
-
3
-
fold
increase
in
eNOS
mRNA
and
protein
levels
as
well
as
a
significant
increase
(
P
<
0
.
05
)
in
NOS
activity
as
measured
by
citrulline
assay
and
nitrite
accumulation
in
the
media
in
response
to
bradykinin
stimulation
.

Treatment
of
cells
with
estrogen
blocking
agent
ICI
182780
inhibited
eNOS
induction
in
response
to
ER
alpha
transfection
.

ER
alpha
gene
transfection
significantly
inhibited
(
P
<
0
.
05
)
bFGF
-
induced
chemotactic
migration
of
endothelial
cells
but
increased
cell
attachment
to
fibronectin
,
laminin
,
and
type
I
and
IV
collagens
.

ER
alpha
gene
transfer
also
inhibited
bFGF
-
stimulated
tyrosine
phosphorylation
of
FAK
.

CONCLUSION
:
Our
results
suggest
that
the
atheroprotective
effects
of
estrogen
may
in
part
be
mediated
by
ER
alpha
-
induced
upregulation
of
eNOS
gene
expression
and
maintenance
of
endothelial
cell
function
and
integrity
.

The
Hsp90
-
specific
inhibitor
geldanamycin
selectively
disrupts
kinase
-
mediated
signaling
events
of
T
-
lymphocyte
activation
.

The
90
-
kDa
heat
shock
protein
(
Hsp90
)
is
the
most
abundant
molecular
chaperone
of
eukaryotic
cells
.

Its
chaperone
function
in
folding
nascent
proteins
seems
to
be
restricted
to
a
subset
of
proteins
including
major
components
of
signal
transduction
pathways
(
eg
,
nuclear
hormone
receptors
,
transcription
factors
,
and
protein
kinases
)
.

Improper
function
of
these
proteins
can
be
induced
by
selective
disruption
of
their
complexes
with
Hsp90
using
the
benzoquinonoid
ansamycin
geldanamycin
.

In
this
study
,
we
demonstrate
that
geldanamycin
treatment
blocks
interleukin
(
IL
)
-
2
secretion
,
IL
-
2
receptor
expression
,
and
proliferation
of
stimulated
T
-
lymphocytes
.

Moreover
,
geldanamycin
decreases
the
amount
and
phosphorylation
of
Lck
and
Raf
-
1
kinases
and
prevents
activation
of
the
extracellular
signal
regulated
kinase
(
ERK
)
-
2
kinase
.

Geldanamycin
also
disrupts
the
T
-
cell
receptor
-
mediated
activation
of
nuclear
factor
of
activated
T
-
cells
(
NF
-
AT
)
.

Treatment
with
geldanamycin
,
however
,
does
not
affect
the
activation
of
lysophosphatide
acyltransferase
,
which
is
a
plasma
membrane
enzyme
coupled
to
the
T
-
cell
receptor
after
T
-
cell
stimulation
.

Through
demonstrating
the
selective
inhibition
of
kinase
-
related
T
-
lymphocyte
responses
by
geldanamycin
,
our
results
emphasize
the
substantial
role
of
Hsp90
-
kinase
complexes
in
T
-
cell
activation
.

Prevention
of
acute
allograft
rejection
in
nonhuman
primate
lung
transplant
recipients
:
induction
with
chimeric
anti
-
interleukin
-
2
receptor
monoclonal
antibody
improves
the
tolerability
and
potentiates
the
immunosuppressive
activity
of
a
regimen
using
low
doses
of
both
microemulsion
cyclosporine
and
40
-
O
-
(
2
-
hydroxyethyl
)
-
rapamycin
.

BACKGROUND
:
In
previous
studies
of
cynomolgus
monkey
lung
allograft
recipients
,
we
demonstrated
significant
immunosuppressive
efficacy
but
reduced
tolerability
after
combined
treatment
with
high
doses
of
microemulsion
cyclosporine
(
CsA
)
and
SDZ
RAD
(
40
-
O
-
(
2
-
hydroxyethyl
)
-
rapamycin
)
.

The
current
study
was
designed
to
compare
efficacy
and
tolerability
of
a
combination
of
low
-
dose
CsA
and
high
-
dose
SDZ
RAD
(
CTL
group
)
to
triple
therapy
using
the
chimeric
anti
-
interleukin
-
2
(
IL
-
2
)
receptor
(
CD25
)
monoclonal
antibody
(
mAb
)
basiliximab
(
anti
-
IL
-
2
receptor
mAb
)
for
induction
therapy
(
basiliximab
:
5
mg
intravenously
on
days
0
and
4
)
plus
low
-
dose
CsA
and
low
-
dose
SDZ
RAD
for
maintenance
immunosuppression
(
CD25
group
)
.

CsA
and
anti
-
IL
-
2
receptor
mAb
are
drugs
that
reduce
cytokine
synthesis
and
block
IL
-
2
-
mediated
lymphocyte
stimulation
,
respectively
.

SDZ
RAD
blocks
lymphocyte
stimulation
by
other
cytokines
(
e
.
g
.
,
IL
-
15
)
that
are
not
inhibited
by
anti
-
IL
-
2
receptor
mAb
.

METHODS
:
Twelve
unilateral
lung
transplants
were
performed
.

Recipients
were
observed
for
49
days
by
daily
weight
assessment
,
hemograms
,
blood
chemistries
,
radiographs
,
and
lung
biopsies
.

Monkeys
were
euthanized
before
day
49
in
the
event
of
excessive
weight
loss
(
>
25
%
)
or
organ
failure
.

Target
CsA
trough
levels
were
100
-
200
ng
/
ml
.

Target
SDZ
RAD
trough
levels
in
the
CTL
group
(
no
mAb
)
were
20
-
40
ng
/
ml
,
and
10
-
20
ng
/
ml
in
the
CD25
group
.

RESULTS
:
None
of
the
monkeys
in
the
CD25
group
needed
to
be
euthanized
early
due
to
signs
of
drug
toxicity
.

In
contrast
,
four
monkeys
in
the
CTL
group
were
sacrificed
on
days
28
-
35
as
a
result
of
excessive
weight
loss
(
n
=
3
)
and
renal
functional
impairment
(
n
=
1
)
.

Three
recipients
in
the
CD25
group
were
euthanized
on
days
36
,
38
,
and
46
as
a
result
of
persistent
high
fever
associated
with
severe
rejection
.

The
median
animal
survival
in
the
CTL
group
was
32
vs
.
46
days
in
the
CD25
group
(
P
<
0
.
04
)
.

The
only
two
long
-
term
survivors
in
the
CTL
group
showed
moderate
rejection
at
day
49
.

The
median
rejection
scores
at
day
14
(
A0
)
and
day
28
(
A2
)
were
identical
in
the
two
groups
,
despite
the
fact
that
the
mean
SDZ
RAD
trough
level
was
significantly
lower
in
the
CD25
group
(
CTL
:
38
+
/
-
3
ng
/
ml
,
CD25
:
18
+
/
-
2
ng
/
ml
,
P
<
0
.
0001
)
.

After
basiliximab
levels
fell
below
the
minimum
therapeutic
level
(
1
mg
/
ml
)
on
day
28
,
the
median
rejection
score
at
day
49
increased
to
A4
in
the
CD25
group
.

CONCLUSION
:
This
is
the
first
study
to
combine
an
anti
-
IL
-
2
receptor
mAb
with
a
drug
from
the
rapamycin
class
plus
CsA
.

Our
study
shows
that
induction
therapy
with
basiliximab
enabled
SDZ
RAD
blood
levels
to
be
significantly
reduced
,
which
led
to
improved
tolerability
without
the
penalty
of
increased
rejection
.

Carnitine

catalyse
the
last
step
in
carnitine
biosynthesis
,
the

,
a
reaction
dependent
on

,
alpha

ketoglutarate
,
ascorbate
and
oxygen
.

Initial
attempts
to
purify
the
protein
from
rat
liver
showed
that
gamma
-
butyrobetaine
hydroxylase
is
unstable
.

We
,
therefore
,
determined
the
influence
of
various
compounds
on
the
stability
of
gamma
-
butyrobetaine
hydroxylase
at
different
storage
temperatures
.

The
enzyme
activity
was
best
conserved
by
storing
the
protein
at
4
degrees
C
in
the
presence
of
200
g

glycerol
and
10
mM

.

We
subsequently
purified
the
enzyme
from
rat
liver
to
apparent
homogeneity
by
liquid
chromatography
.

,
as
well
as
the

was
determined
following

in
Xenopus
oocytes
using
two

(
TEVC
)
and
excised
,
inside

.

1

,
and
ZOX
activated
both
hIK1
and
rSK2
in
TEVC
and
excised
inside

.

In
excised
,
inside

,
1

EBIO
and
CZ
induced
a
concentration

,
respectively
.

Similarly
,
CZ
activated
rSK2
with
a
K
(
1

)
of
87
microM
.

In
the
absence
of
CZ
,
the
Ca
(

activation
of
hIK1
was
best
fit
with
a
K
(

)
of
700
nM
and
a
Hill

rSK2
was
activated
by

with
a
K
(

of
700
nM
and
an

Addition
of
CZ
had
no
effect
on
either

or
n
for
Ca
(
2

Rather
,
CZ
increased
channel

at
all
Ca

)
.

Event

revealed
hIK1
was
minimally

had
no
effect
on
tau
(

,
whereas
tau

In
conclusion
,
we
define
1

CZ
,
and
ZOX
as
the
first
known
activators
of
hIK1

decapeptides
,
modeling
the
primary
structure
of
molecule
,
and
chymotryptic

been
investigated
.

The

has
shown
that
plasminogen

in
the
set
of

Interactions
of
the

.

The
human
multidrug
resistance
protein
MRP1
and
its
homolog
,
MRP2
,
are
both
suggested
as
being
involved
in
cancer
drug
resistance
and
the
transport
of
organic

.

We
expressed
MRP1
and
MRP2
in
Spodoptera

ovarian
cells
and
compared
their
ATP

transport
properties
and
vanadate

Both
MRP1

actively
transported
leukotriene

,
although
the
relative
affinity
of
MRP2
for
these
substrates
was
found
to
be
significantly
lower
than
that
of
MRP1
.

Methotrexate
was
actively
transported
by
both
proteins
,
although
more
efficiently
by
MRP2
.

ATP

GS
transport
by
MRP1

MRP2
was
variably
modulated
by

all
significantly
increased
MRP2

,
whereas
these

acted
more
as

These
results
indicate
that
MRP1
is
a
more
efficient
transporter
of
glutathione

and
free

than
MRP2
,
whereas
several
anions
are

Our

that

be
responsible
for
the

Aspirin
and
sodium
salicylate
inhibit
endothelin
ETA
receptors
by
an
allosteric
type
of
mechanism
.

Aspirin
is
a
commonly
used
drug
with
a
wide
pharmacological
spectrum
including
antiplatelet
,
anti

inflammatory
,
and
neuroprotective
actions
.

This
study
shows
that
aspirin
and
sodium
salicylate
,
its
major
blood
metabolite
,
reverse
contractile
actions
of
endothelin
-
1
(
ET

in

but
not
those

Inhibition
of
the

on
the
rate

The

were
evaluated
in

N

.

UNLABELLED
:
Large
concentrations
of
meperidine
inhibit
N
-
methyl
-
D
-
aspartate
-
(
NMDA
)
receptor
channels
by
channel
block
mechanisms
.

Extracellular
pH
regulates
the
activity
and
drug
sensitivity
of
NMDA
-
receptor
channels
.

We
examined
the
influence
of
extracellular
pH
on
sensitivity
to
meperidine
of
epsilon
/
zeta
heteromeric
NMDA
-
receptor
channels
expressed
in
Xenopus
oocytes
.

Inhibition
of
epsilon1

zeta1
,
epsilon2
/
zeta1
,
epsilon3
/
zeta1
,
and
epsilon4
/
zeta1
channels
by
meperidine
was
dependent
on
pH
,
with
more
inhibition
at
acidic
pH
and
less
inhibition
at
alkaline
pH
.

The
degree
of
voltage
-
dependence
of
meperidine
block
was
only
slightly
affected
by
changes
in
pH
,
whereas
affinity
for
meperidine
was
greatly
reduced
at
alkaline
pH
.

Furthermore
,
interaction
of
meperidine
with
Mg
(
2
+
)
block
was
reduced
at
alkaline
pH
.

Because
the
percentage
of
the
protonated
form
of
meperidine
is
only
slightly
affected
by
pH
,
changes
in
properties
of
the
meperidine
binding
site
may
be
involved
in
mechanisms
of
alteration
of
meperidine
potency
by
pH
.

IMPLICATIONS
:
At
acidic
pH
the
potency
of
meperidine
for
N
-
methyl
-
D
-
aspartate
-
receptor
channels
was
increased
.

Any

and
neuroprotective
benefit
from
the

Statins
:
effective
antiatherosclerotic
therapy
.

BACKGROUND
:
Statins
are
the
most
effective
agents
currently
available
for
lowering
plasma
levels
of
low
-
density
lipoprotein
cholesterol
(
LDL
-
C
)
and
are
the
mainstay
of
therapy
for
hyperlipidemia
.

The
statins
are
highly
liver
-
selective
,
inhibiting
3
-
hydroxy
-
3
-
methylglutaryl
-
coenzyme
A
(
HMG
-
CoA
)
reductase
,
a
key
enzyme
in
the
synthesis
of
cholesterol
.

Several
large
,
controlled
clinical
trials
have
confirmed
significant
reductions
in
rates
of
coronary
heart
disease
morbidity
and
death
with
long
-
term
statin
therapy
in
patients
with
mild
to
severe
hypercholesterolemia
.

METHODS
AND
RESULTS
:
This
review
article
is
based
on
a
literature
search
of
more
than
60
relevant
articles
from
peer
-
reviewed
journals
.

Search
engines
included
Medline
and
Embase
.

In
surveying
clinical
and
angiographic
evidence
,
we
found
that
statins
appear
to
reduce
the
incidence
of
coronary
events
by
slowing
the
progression
of
atherosclerosis
and
preventing
atheromatous
lesion
formation
.

We
found
that
the
6
statins
currently
marketed
-
atorvastatin
,
cerivastatin
,
fluvastatin
,
lovastatin
,
pravastatin
,
and
simvastatin
-
differ
in
their
inhibitory
action
on
the
HMG
-
CoA
reductase
enzyme
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
The
use
of
more
potent
statins
such
as
atorvastatin
and
simvastatin
affords
greater
lowering
of
LDL
-
C
and
triglyceride
levels
,
allowing
more
patients
to
achieve
target
goals
.

The
question
of
how
low
LDL
-
C
levels
should
be
lowered
will
be
answered
by
ongoing
clinical
trials
.

A
unique
cytosolic
activity
related
but
distinct
from
NQO1
catalyses
metabolic
activation
of
mitomycin
C
.

Mitomycin
C
(
MMC
)
is
a
prototype
bioreductive
drug
employed
to
treat
a
variety
of
cancers
including
head
and
neck
cancer
.

Among
the
various
enzymes
,
dicoumarol
inhibitable
cytosolic
NAD
(
P
)
H
:
quinone
oxidoreductase1
(
NQO1
)
was
shown
to
catalyse
bioreductive
activation
of
MMC
leading
to
cross
-
linking
of
the
DNA
and
cytotoxicity
.

However
,
the
role
of
NQO1
in
metabolic
activation
of
MMC
has
been
disputed
.

In
this
report
,
we
present
cellular
and
animal
models
to
demonstrate
that
NQO1
may
play
only
a
minor
role
in
metabolic
activation
of
MMC
.

We
further
demonstrate
that
bioreductive
activation
of
MMC
is
catalysed
by
a
unique
cytosolic
activity
which
is
related
but
distinct
from
NQO1
.

Chinese
hamster
ovary
(
CHO
)
cells
were
developed
that
permanently
express
higher
levels
of
cDNA
-
derived
NQO1
.

These
cells
showed
significantly
increased
protection
against
menadione
toxicity
.

However
,
they
failed
to
demonstrate
higher
cytotoxicity
due
to
exposure
to
MMC
under
oxygen
(
normal
air
)
or
hypoxia
,
as
compared
to
the
wild
-
type
control
CHO
cells
.

Disruption
of
the
NQO1
gene
by
homologous
recombination
generated
NQO1
-
/
-
mice
that
do
not
express
the
NQO1
gene
resulting
in
the
loss
of
NQO1
protein
and
activity
.

The
cytosolic
fractions
from
liver
and
colon
tissues
of
NQO1
-
/
-
mice
showed
similar
amounts
of
DNA
cross
-
linking
upon
exposure
to
MMC
,
as
observed
in
NQO1
+
/
+
mice
.

The
unique
cytosolic
activity
that
activated
MMC
in
cytosolic
fractions
of
liver
and
colon
tissues
of
NQO1
-
/
-
mice
was
designated
as
cytosolic
MMC
reductase
.

This
activity
,
like
NQO1
,
was
inhibited
by
dicoumarol
and
immunologically
related
to
NQO1
.

High
affinity
blockade
of
the
HERG
cardiac
K
(
+
)
channel
by
the
neuroleptic
pimozide
.

Pimozide
is
an
antipsychotic
agent
also
used
to
treat
facial
tics
.

Pimozide
can
cause
acquired
long
QT
syndrome
and
ventricular
arrhythmias
.

To
elucidate
the
mechanism
behind
these
clinical
findings
,
we
examined
the
effects
of
pimozide
on
the
cloned
human
cardiac
K
(
+
)
channels
HERG
(
human
ether
-
a
-
go
-
go
-
related
gene
;
rapid
component
of
delayed

)
,
Kv1
.
5
(
ultra
-
rapid
delayed
rectifier
)
and
KvLQT1
/
minK
(
slow
component
of
delayed
rectifier
)
.

Using
patch
clamp
electrophysiology
,
we
found
that
pimozide
was
a
potent
inhibitor
of
HERG
displaying
an
IC
(
50
)
value
of
18
nM
.

In
contrast
,
pimozide
(
10
microM
)
was
a
weak
inhibitor
of
KvLQT1
/
minK
and
Kv1
.
5
.

We
conclude
that
pimozide
is
a
specific
,
high
affinity
antagonist
of
HERG
,
and
that
this
interaction
leads
to
prolongation
of
cardiac
repolarization
.

Effect
of
L
-
arginine
-
nitric
oxide
system
on
the
metabolism
of
essential
fatty
acids
in
chemical
-
induced
diabetes
mellitus
.

Several
studies
have
shown
that
the
activities
of
delta
-
6
-
desaturase
and
delta
-
5
-
desaturase
are
depressed
in
experimental
diabetes
and
in
humans
with
insulin
-
and
non
-
insulin
-
dependent
diabetes
mellitus
(
type
I
and
type
II
diabetes
mellitus
respectively
)
.

Furthermore
,
treatment
with
insulin
is
known
to
correct
the
defects
in
desaturases
in
rats
and
humans
with
diabetes
,
especially
in
type
I
.

In
a
recent
study
,
we
demonstrated
that
L
-
arginine
and
nitric
oxide
can
prevent
alloxan
-
induced
beta
cell
damage
,
and
the
severity
of
diabetes
,
and
restore
the
antioxidant
status
to
near
normal
levels
.

But
,
no
information
is
available
as
to
the
relationship
between
L
-
arginine
-
nitric
oxide
system
and
the
metabolism
of
essential
fatty
acids
in
diabetes
mellitus
.

In
the
present
study
,
it
was
noted
that
the
plasma
levels
of
saturated
fatty
acids
:
stearic
and
palmitic
were
increased
where
as
unsaturated
fatty
acids
such
as
oleic
,
linoleic
,
gamma
-
linolenic
and
eicosapentaenoic
acids
(
OA
,
LA
,
GLA
and
EPA
respectively
)
were
decreased
in
alloxan
-
induced
diabetic
rats
.

In
the
liver
phospholipid
(
PL
)
fraction
,
GLA
,
DGLA
(
dihomo
-
GLA
)
and
alpha
-
linolenic
acid
(
ALA
)
were
decreased
in
the
alloxan
-
treated
group
;
in
the
muscle
PL
fraction
,
LA
,
GLA
and
DGLA
were
low
,
whereas
an
increase
in
the
saturated
fatty
acid
content
was
noted
.

L
-
arginine
(
the
precursor
of
nitric
oxide
)
and
sodium
nitroprusside
(
a
nitric
oxide
donor
)
treatment
of
alloxan
-
induced
diabetic
rats
enhanced
the
levels
of
LA
,
GLA
and
DGLA
.

Further
,
nitric
oxide
synthase
inhibitor
,
L
-
NMMA
,
prevented
this
beneficial
action
of
L
-
arginine
-
nitric
oxide
system
on
essential
fatty
acid
metabolism
.

The
abnormalities
in
the
essential
fatty
acid
metabolism
observed
also
reverted
to
normalcy
following
control
of
diabetes
with
insulin
.

These
results
indicate
that
nitric
oxide
can
enhance
the
activities
of
delta
-
6
-
and
delta
-
5
desaturases
,
which
are
depressed
in
diabetes
,
and
suggests
that
there
is
a
close
interaction
between
L
-
arginine
-
nitric
oxide
system
and
the
metabolism
of
essential
fatty
acids
.

CONCLUSION

INTERPRETATION
:
This
study
provides
evidence
that
troglitazone
reduces
PAI
-
1
production
in
human
adipocytes
,
probably
at
the
transcriptional
level
.

This
observation
could
point
to
a
new
beneficial
effect
of
troglitazone
,
particularly
in
obese
subjects
,
which
could
be
associated
with
a
reduced
cardiovascular
risk
.

Topiramate
as
an
inhibitor
of
carbonic
anhydrase
isoenzymes
.

PURPOSE
:
This
study
investigated
the
effectiveness
of
topiramate
(
TPM
)
as
an
inhibitor
of
six
isozymes
of
carbonic
anhydrase
(
CA
)
.

METHODS
:
The
inhibition
constants
(
Ki
)
of
TPM
and
acetazolamide
(
AZM
)
for
CA
I
,
CA
II
,
CA
III
,
CA
IV
,
CA
V
,
and
CA
VI
were
determined
for
human
(
HCA
)
,
rat
(
RCA
)
,
or
mouse
(
MCA
)
.

The
activity
of
CA
was
studied
by
using
purified
isozymes
,
erythrocytes
,
subcellular
fractions
of
kidney
or
brain
,
and
saliva
,
and
was
assayed
at
37
degrees
C
or
25
degrees
C
by
18O
mass
spectrometry
and
/
or
by
measuring
the
pH
shift
at
0
degrees
C
.

RESULTS
:
Topiramate
Ki
values
for
HCA
I
,
HCA
II
,
HCA
IV
,
and
HCA
VI
were
approximately
100
,
7
,
10
,
and
>
100
microM
,
respectively
.

TPM
Ki
values
for
RCA
I
,
RCA
II
,
RCA
III
,
RCA
IV
,
and
RCA
V
were
approximately
180
,
0
.
1
to
1
,
>
100
,
0
.
2
to
10
and
18
microM
,
respectively
.

For
RCA
II
and
RCA
IV
,
the
Ki
values
were
temperature
dependent
.

TPM
Ki
values
for
MCA
II
and
MCA
IV
ranged
between
1
and
20
microM
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
These
results
indicate
that
TPM
is
more
potent
as
an
inhibitor
of
CA
II
and
CA
IV
than
of
CA
I
,
CA
III
,
and
CA
VI
.

In
all
three
species
,
AZM
was
usually
10
to
100
times
more
potent
than
TPM
as
an
inhibitor
of
CA
isozymes
.

In
the
contraction

,
phenylephrine

produced
concentration

in

.

In
these

(

)
significantly
decreased
urethral
pressure
by
15
%
without

.

Tamsulosin
(

)
decreased
urethral
pressure
to
the
same
extent
as
did
JTH

601
,
but
with
a
significant
effect
on
blood
pressure
and
heart
rate
.

JTH
-
601
showed
higher
selectivity
for
canine
prostate
both
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
.

In
prostate
,
an
important
role
of
the
alpha
(
1L
)
-
adrenoceptor
is
suggested
in
the
smooth
muscle
contraction
mediated
by
alpha
(
1
)
-
adrenoceptors
.

JTH
-
601
is
expected
to
be
an
effective
alpha
(
1
)
-
adrenoceptor
antagonist
for
the
treatment
of
urinary
outlet
obstruction
by
benign
prostatic

with
a
minimum

.

Cyclooxygenase

2
contributes
to
N
-
methyl
-
D
-
aspartate
-
mediated
neuronal
cell
death
in
primary
cortical
cell
culture
.

Cyclooxygenase
isozymes
(
COX
-
1
and
COX
-
2
)
are
found
to
be
constitutively
expressed
in
brain
,
with
neuronal
expression
of
COX
-
2
being
rapidly
induced
after
numerous
insults
,
including
cerebral
ischemia
.

Because
overactivation
of
N
-
methyl
-
D
-
aspartate
(
NMDA
)
receptors
has
been
implicated
in
the
cell
loss
associated
with
ischemia
,
we
characterized
the
expression
of
the
COX
isozymes
in
murine
mixed
cortical
cell
cultures
and
used
isozyme
-
selective
inhibitors
to
determine
their
relative
contribution
to
NMDA
receptor
-
stimulated
prostaglandin
(
PG
)
production
and
excitotoxic
neuronal
cell
death
.

Immunocytochemical
analysis
of
mixed
cortical
cell
cultures
revealed
that
COX
-
2
expression
was
restricted
to
neurons
,
whereas
COX
-
1
was
expressed
in
both
neurons
and
astrocytes
.

Brief
exposure
to
NMDA
(
5
min
;
100
microM
)
elicited
a
time
-
dependent
accumulation
of
PGs
in
the
culture
medium
that
preceded
neuronal
cell
death
and
correlated
with
the
induction
of
COX
-
2
mRNA
.

COX
-
1
expression
remained
unchanged
.

Flurbiprofen
,
a
nonselective
COX
-
1
/
COX
-
2
inhibitor
,
blocked
NMDA
-
stimulated
PG
production
and
attenuated
neuronal
death
in
a
concentration
-
dependent
manner
.

Similar
results
were
obtained
with
the
specific
COX
-
2
inhibitor
NS
-
398
(
10
-
30
microM
)
but
not
with
the
selective
COX
-
1
inhibitor
valeryl
salicylate
(
10
-
300
microM
)
.

Inhibition
of
total
constitutive
COX
activity
with
aspirin
(
100
microM
,
1
.
5
h
)
before
NMDA
exposure
did
not
prevent
subsequent
NMDA
-
mediated
neuronal
cell
death
.

However
,
neuronal
injury
in
aspirin
-
pretreated
cultures
was
attenuated
by
flurbiprofen
administration
after
NMDA
exposure
.

Finally
,
the
protection
afforded
by
COX
-
2
inhibition
was
specific
for
NMDA
because
neither
flurbiprofen
nor
NS
-
398
protected
neurons
against
kainate
-
mediated
neurotoxicity
.

Together
,
these
results
support
the
conclusion
that
newly
synthesized
COX
-
2
protein
contributes
to
NMDA
-
induced
neuronal
injury
.

Inhibition
of
the
human
intermediate
conductance
Ca
(
2
+
)
-
activated
K
(
+
)
channel
,
hIK1
,
by
volatile
anesthetics
.

Ca
(
2
+
)
-
activated
K
(
+
)
channels
(
K
(
Ca
)
)
regulate
a
wide
variety
of
cellular
functions
by
coupling
intracellular
Ca
(
2
+
)
concentration
to
membrane
potential
.

There
are
three
major
groups
of
K
(
Ca
)
classified
by
their
unit
conductances
:
large
(
BK
)
,
intermediate
(
IK
)
,
and
small
(
SK
)
conductance
of
channels
.

BK
channel
is
gated
by
combined
influences
of
Ca
(
2
+
)
and
voltage
,
while
IK
and
SK
channels
are
gated
solely
by
Ca
(
2
+
)
.

Volatile
anesthetics
inhibit
BK
channel
activity
by
interfering
with
the
Ca
(
2
+
)
gating
mechanism
.

However
,
the
effects
of
anesthetics
on
IK
and
SK
channels
are
unknown
.

Using
cloned
IK
and
SK
channels
,
hIK1
and
hSK1
-
3
,
respectively
,
we
found
that
the
currents
of
hIK1
were
inhibited
rapidly
and
reversibly
by
volatile
anesthetics
,
whereas
those
of
SK
channels
were
not
affected
.

The
IC
(
50
)
values
of
the
volatile
anesthetics
,
halothane
,
sevoflurane
,
enflurane
,
and
isoflurane
for
hIK1
inhibition
were
0
.
69
,
0
.
42
,
1
.
01
and
1
.
03
mM
,
respectively
,
and
were
in
the
clinically
used
concentration
range
.

In
contrast
to
BK
channel
,
halothane
inhibition
of
hIK1
currents
was
independent
of
Ca
(
2
+
)
concentration
,
suggesting
that
Ca
(
2
+
)
gating
mechanism
is
not
involved
.

These
results
demonstrate
that
volatile
anesthetics
,
such
as
halothane
,
enflurane
,
isoflurane
,
and
sevoflurane
,
affect
BK
,
IK
,
and
SK
channels
in
distinct
ways
.

Characterization
of
phentermine
and
related
compounds
as
monoamine
oxidase
(
MAO
)
inhibitors
.

Phentermine
was
shown
in
the
1970s
to
inhibit
the
metabolism
of
serotonin
by
monoamine
oxidase
(
MAO
)
,
but
never
was
labeled
as
an
MAO
inhibitor
;
hence
,
it
was
widely
used
in
combination
with
fenfluramine
,
and
continues
to
be
used
,
in
violation
of
their
labels
,
with
other
serotonin
uptake
blockers
.

We
examined
the
effects
of
phentermine
and
several
other
unlabeled
MAO
inhibitors
on
MAO
activities
in
rat
lung
,
brain
,
and
liver
,
and
also
the
interactions
of
such
drugs
when
administered
together
.

Rat
tissues
were
assayed
for
MAO
-
A
and
-
B
,
using
serotonin
and
beta
-
phenylethylamine
as
substrates
.

Phentermine
inhibited
serotonin
-
metabolizing
(
MAO
-
A
)
activity
in
all
three
tissues
with
K
(
i
)
values
of
85
-
88
microM
.

These
potencies
were
similar
to
those
of
the
antidepressant
MAO
inhibitors
iproniazid
and
moclobemide
.

When
phentermine
was
mixed
with
other
unlabeled
reversible
MAO
inhibitors
(
e
.
g
.
pseudoephedrine
,
ephedrine
,
norephedrine
;
estradiol
benzoate
)
,
the
degree
of
MAO
inhibition
was
additive
.

The
cardiac
valvular
lesions
and
primary
pulmonary
hypertension
that
have
been
reported
to
be
associated
with
fenfluramine
-
phentermine
use
may
have
resulted
from
the
intermittent
concurrent
blockage
of
both
serotonin
uptake
and
metabolism
.

Comparison

,
and
the
ACE
inhibitor
,

patients
.

AIM
:
To
compare
candesartan
cilexetil
and
lisinopril
in
fixed
combination
with
hydrochlorothiazide
with
respect
to
antihypertensive
efficacy
and
tolerability
.

METHODS
:
This
was
a
double

blind
(
double

)
,
randomised
,
parallel
group
comparison
in
patients
with
a
mean
sitting

antihypertensive
monotherapy
.

Treatments
were
candesartan
cilexetil
/
hydrochlorothiazide
8

5
mg
once

(
n

and
lisinopril

10
/
12
.
5
mg
once
daily
(
n
=
116
)
for
26
weeks
.

The
primary
efficacy
variable
was
change
in
trough
sitting
diastolic
blood
pressure
.

RESULTS
:
Changes
in
mean
sitting
diastolic
blood
pressure
did
not
differ
significantly
between
the
groups
(

.

No

was
found
for

variables
(

,
and
proportion
of

and
controlled
patients
)
.

Both
drugs
were
well
tolerated
but
the
proportion
of
patients
with
at
least
one
adverse
event
was
significantly
greater
in
the
lisinopril
group
(
80

)
.

The
proportion
of
patients
spontaneously

)
and
discontinuing
therapy
due
to
adverse
events
(
12

0
%
vs

.
9
%
)
was
also
higher
in
the
lisinopril
group
compared
with
the
candesartan
cilexetil
group
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
The
fixed
combinations
of
candesartan
cilexetil
and
hydrochlorothiazide
8
/
12
.
5
mg
and
lisinopril
and
hydrochlorothiazide
10
/
12
.
5
mg
once
daily
are
equally
effective
as
antihypertensive
agents
.

The
fixed
combination
containing
candesartan
cilexetil
is
better
tolerated
than
that
containing
lisinopril
.

NADH
-
ferric
reductase
activity
associated
with
dihydropteridine
reductase
.

In
mammals
dietary
ferric
iron
is
reduced
to
ferrous
iron
for
more
efficient
absorption
by
the
intestine
.

Analysis
of
a
pig
duodenal
membrane
fraction
revealed
two
NADH
-
dependent
ferric
reductase
activities
,
one
associated
with
a
b
-
type
cytochrome
and
the
other
not
.

Purification
and
characterization
of
the
non
-
cytochrome
ferric
reductase
identified
a
31
kDa
protein
.

MALDI
-
MS
analysis
and
amino
acid
sequencing
identified
the
ferric
reductase
as
being
related
to
the
26
kDa
liver
NADH
-
dependent
quinoid
dihydropteridine
reductase
(
DHPR
)
.

The
NADH
-
dependent
DHPR
ferric
reductase
activity
was
found
to
be
pteridine
-
independent
since
exhaustive
dialysis
did
not
reduce
activity
and
heat
-
inactivation
destroyed
activity
.

In
intestinal
Caco
-
2
cells
,
DHPR
mRNA
levels
were
found
to
be
regulated
by
iron
.

Thus
,
DHPR
appears
to
be
a
dual
function
enzyme
,
a
NADH
-
dependent
dihydopteridine
reductase
and
an
iron
-
regulated
,
NADH

,
pteridine
-
independent
ferric

The

Irbesartan
:
review
of
pharmacology
and
comparative
properties
.

The
recently
developed
and
marketed
angiotensin
II
type
1
(
AT1
)
receptor
blockers
(
ARBs
)
have
demonstrated
efficacy
equivalent
to
that
of
other
leading
classes
of
antihypertensive
agents
,
with
superior
tolerability
profiles
.

The
specific
targeting
of
the
AT1
receptor
afforded
by
these
agents
has
demonstrated
more
complete
blockade
of
the
renin
-
angiotensin
system
than
that
offered
by
angiotensin
-
converting
enzyme
inhibitors
.

These
data
notwithstanding
,
differentiation
within
the
class
of
ARBs
has
been
limited
.

With
the
accumulation
of
additional
data
with
ARBs
,
it
has
recently
become
possible
to
make
within
-
class
distinctions
,
based
in
large
part
on
the
individual
pharmacological
profiles
of
the
ARBs
.

To
this
end
,
absorption
,
distribution
,
half
-
life
,
dose
response
and
level
of
angiotensin
II
antagonism
are
of
special
note
.

When
these
properties
are
viewed
as
a
group
,
the
ARB
irbesartan
appears
to
offer
advantages
beyond
those
attained
with
other
ARBs
.

Irbesartan
is
well
absorbed
,
does
not
require
biotransformation
to
an
active
metabolite
to
exert
its
antihypertensive
activity
,
offers
a
large
volume
of
distribution
,
has
a
half
-
life
that
is
sufficient
to
allow
once
-
daily
dosing
,
is
associated
with
a
strong
and
consistent
dose
-
response
and
has
been
demonstrated
to
provide
a
level
of
angiotensin
II
antagonism
that
is
statistically
superior
to
that
offered
by
some
other
ARBs
.

These
pharmacological
differences
may
explain
the
clinical
superiority
of
irbesartan
compared
with
losartan
,
the
first
member
of
the
ARB
class
.

As
even
more
data
on
the
ARBs
become
available
,
the
ability
to
determine
the
advantages
of
specific
members
of
this
class
will
be
enhanced
,
distinctions
that
already
have
begun
to
come
to
light
.

Amphetamine
-
induced
loss
of
human
dopamine
transporter
activity
:
an
internalization
-
dependent
and
cocaine
-
sensitive
mechanism
.

The
dopamine
transporter
(
DAT
)
is
a
target
of
amphetamine
(
AMPH
)
and
cocaine
.

These
psychostimulants
attenuate
DAT
clearance
efficiency
,
thereby
increasing
synaptic
dopamine
(
DA
)
levels
.

Re
-
uptake
rate
is
determined
by
the
number
of
functional
transporters
at
the
cell
surface
as
well
as
by
their
turnover
rate
.

Here
,
we
present
evidence
that
DAT
substrates
,
including
AMPH
and
DA
,
cause
internalization
of
human
DAT
,
thereby
reducing
transport
capacity
.

Acute
treatment
with
AMPH
reduced
the
maximal
rate
of
[
(
3
)
H
]
DA
uptake
,
decreased
AMPH
-
induced
currents
,
and
significantly
redistributed
the
immunofluorescence
of
an
epitope
-
tagged
DAT
from
the
plasma
membrane
to
the
cytosol
in
human
embryonic
kidney
293
cells
.

Conversely
,
DAT
inhibitors
,
such
as
cocaine
,
mazindol
,
and
nomifensine
,
when
administered
with
AMPH
,
blocked
the
reduction
in
[
(
3
)
H
]
DA
uptake
and
the
redistribution
of
DAT
immunofluorescence
to
the
cytosol
.

The
reductions
of
[
(
3
)
H
]
DA
uptake
and
AMPH
-
induced
DAT
internalization
also
were
inhibited
by
coexpression
of
a
dominant
negative
mutant
of
dynamin
I
(
K44A
)
,
indicating
that
endocytosis
modulates
transport
capacity
,
likely
through
a
clathrin
-
mediated
pathway
.

With
this
mechanism
of
regulation
,
acute
application
of
AMPH
would
reduce
DA
uptake
not
only
by
direct
competition
for
uptake
,
but
also
by
reducing
the
available
cell
-
surface
DAT
.

Moreover
,
AMPH
-
induced
internalization
might
diminish
the
amount
of
DAT
available
for
DA
efflux
,
thereby
modulating
the
cytotoxic
effects
of
elevated
extracellular
DA
.

Peroxisome
proliferator
-
activated
receptor
alpha
activators
improve
insulin
sensitivity
and
reduce
adiposity
.

Fibrates
and
glitazones
are
two
classes
of
drugs
currently
used
in
the
treatment
of
dyslipidemia
and
insulin
resistance
(
IR
)
,
respectively
.

Whereas
glitazones
are
insulin
sensitizers
acting
via
activation
of
the
peroxisome
proliferator
-
activated
receptor
(
PPAR
)
gamma
subtype
,
fibrates
exert
their
lipid
-
lowering
activity
via
PPARalpha
.

To
determine
whether
PPARalpha
activators
also
improve
insulin
sensitivity
,
we
measured
the
capacity
of
three
PPARalpha
-
selective
agonists
,
fenofibrate
,
ciprofibrate
,
and
the
new
compound
GW9578
,
in
two
rodent
models
of
high
fat
diet
-
induced
(
C57BL
/
6
mice
)
or
genetic
(
obese
Zucker
rats
)
IR
.

At
doses
yielding
serum
concentrations
shown
to
activate
selectively
PPARalpha
,
these
compounds
markedly
lowered
hyperinsulinemia
and
,
when
present
,
hyperglycemia
in
both
animal
models
.

This
effect
relied
on
the
improvement
of
insulin
action
on
glucose
utilization
,
as
indicated
by
a
lower
insulin
peak
in
response
to
intraperitoneal
glucose
in
ciprofibrate
-
treated
IR
obese
Zucker
rats
.

In
addition
,
fenofibrate
treatment
prevented
high
fat
diet
-
induced
increase
of
body
weight
and
adipose
tissue
mass
without
influencing
caloric
intake
.

The
specificity
for
PPARalpha
activation
in
vivo
was
demonstrated
by
marked
alterations
in
the
expression
of
PPARalpha
target
genes
,
whereas
PPARgamma
target
gene
mRNA
levels
did
not
change
in
treated
animals
.

These
results
indicate
that
compounds
with
a
selective
PPARalpha
activation
profile
reduce
insulin
resistance
without
having
adverse
effects
on
body
weight
and
adipose
tissue
mass
in
animal
models
of
IR
.

Recent
developments
in
receptor
-
selective
retinoids
.

Natural
(
all
trans
-
retinoic
acid
,
RA
)
and
synthetic
retinoids
exhibit
potent
anti
-
proliferative
,
normalization
of
differentiation
and
anti
-
inflammatory
activities
which
appear
to
account
for
their
therapeutic
effects
in
acne
,
psoriasis
,
photoaging
,
precancerous
lesions
and
established
cancers
.

Although
RA
has
shown
considerable
promise
in
dermatologic
indications
,
certain
side
effects
have
restricted
its
use
as
a
choice
of
agent
for
chronic
administration
.

Systematic
synthesis
of
receptor
-
selective
retinoids
has
resulted
in
two
topical
drugs
,
Tazorac
/
Zorac
(
tazarotene
)
and
Differin
(
adapalene
)
.

Tazorac
is
indicated
for
psoriasis
and
acne
and
Differin
gel
for
the
treatment
of
acne
.

These
drugs
bind
to
the
retinoic
acid
receptor
(
RAR
)
family
members
.

Various
RAR
subtype
-
specific
and
function
-
selective
retinoids
have
been
synthesized
.

These
retinoids
,
which
are
in
various
stages
of
pre
-
clinical
development
for
the
treatment
of
cancers
,
psoriasis
and
as
an
antidote
to
Accutane
-
mediated
mucocutaneous
toxicity
,
will
also
be
discussed
in
this
review
.

Discovery
of
another
retinoid
receptor
,
retinoid
X
receptor
(
RXR
)
,
revealed
that
RXR
-
specific
retinoids
already
existed
in
retinoid
chemical
libraries
.

Structure
activity
relationship
studies
based
upon
binding
and
transactivation
assays
led
to
the
synthesis
of
RXR
-
specific
ligands
with
high
affinities
for
RXR
subtypes
.

These
compounds
were
found
to
be
effective
in
the
treatment
of
hyperglycemia
in
animal
models
of
type
II
diabetes
.

The
discovery
of
novel
retinoids
along
with
an
increased
understanding
of
the
biological
functions
and
mechanisms
of
action
of
retinoid
receptors
are
likely
to
result
in
improved
treatments
for
existing
responsive
indications
and
identification
of
new
retinoid
therapeutic
targets
.

Severe
impairment
of
salivation
in
Na
+
/
K
+
/
2Cl
-
cotransporter
(
NKCC1
)
-
deficient
mice
.

The
salivary
fluid
secretory
mechanism
is
thought
to
require
Na
(
+
)
/
K
(
+
)
/
2Cl
(
-
)
cotransporter
-
mediated
Cl
(
-
)
uptake
.

To
directly
test
this
possibility
we
studied
the
in
vivo
and
in
vitro
functioning
of
acinar
cells
from
the
parotid
glands
of
mice
with
targeted
disruption
of
Na
(
+
)
/
K
(
+
)
/
2Cl
(
-
)
cotransporter
isoform
1
(
Nkcc1
)
,
the
gene
encoding
the
salivary
Na
(
+
)
/
K
(
+
)
/
2Cl
(
-
)
cotransporter
.

In
wild
-
type
mice
NKCC1
was
localized
to
the
basolateral
membranes
of
parotid
acinar
cells
,
whereas
expression
was
not
detected
in
duct
cells
.

The
lack
of
functional
NKCC1
resulted
in
a
dramatic
reduction
(
>
60
%
)
in
the
volume
of
saliva
secreted
in
response
to
a
muscarinic
agonist
,
the
primary
in
situ
salivation
signal
.

Consistent
with
defective
Cl
(
-
)
uptake
,
a
loss
of
bumetanide
-
sensitive
Cl
(
-
)
influx
was
observed
in
parotid
acinar
cells
from
mice
lacking
NKCC1
.

Cl
(
-
)
/
HCO
(
3
)
(
-
)
exchanger
activity
was
increased
in
parotid
acinar
cells
isolated
from
knockout
mice
suggesting
that
the
residual
saliva
secreted
by
mice
lacking
NKCC1
is
associated
with
anion
exchanger
-
dependent
Cl
(
-
)
uptake
.

Indeed
,
expression
of
the
Cl
(
-
)
/
HCO
(
3
)
(
-
)
exchanger
AE2
was
enhanced
suggesting
that
this
transporter
compensates
for
the
loss
of
functional
Na
(
+
)
/
K
(
+
)
/
2Cl
(
-
)
cotransporter
.

Furthermore
,
the
ability
of
the
parotid
gland
to
conserve
NaCl
was
abolished
in
NKCC1
-
deficient
mice
.

This
deficit
was
not
associated
with
changes
in
the
morphology
of
the
ducts
,
but
transcript
levels
for
the
alpha
-
,
beta
-
,
and
gamma
-
subunits
of
the
epithelial
Na
(
+
)
channel
were
reduced
.

These
data
directly
demonstrate
that
NKCC1
is
the
major
Cl
(
-
)
uptake
mechanism
across
the
basolateral
membrane
of
acinar
cells
and
is
critical
for
driving
saliva
secretion
in
vivo
.

Induction
of
estrogen
receptor
-
alpha
and
-
beta
activities
by
synthetic
progestins
.

The
cellular
action
of
steroid
hormones
is
mediated
by
specific
receptors
.

Recently
,
two
different
estrogen
receptors
(
ER
)
,
alpha
and
beta
,
have
been
cloned
with
a
specific
tissue
distribution
.

Active
estrogen
as
well
as
active
progestin
are
compounds
of
oral
hormonal
contraceptives
and
hormone
replacement
therapy
.

To
examine
the
regulation
of
ER
-
alpha
and
-
beta
activities
after
treatment
with
synthetic
progestins
and
synthetic
and
natural
estrogens
,
COS
7
cells
were
transfected
with
the
vector
expressing
ER
-
alpha
and
-
beta
in
combination
with
a
luciferase
reporter
vector
.

ER
-
alpha
activity
was
upregulated
in
the
presence
of
synthetic
progestins
in
a
dose
-
dependent
manner
.

Norethisterone
,
norethynodrel
and
desogestrel
proved
to
be
the
most
potent
stimulatory
agents
of
ER
-
alpha
expression
.

On
the
other
hand
,
not
all
progestins
exhibited
a
stimulatory
action
on
ER
-
beta
activity
.

Only
norgestrel
,
levonorgestrel
,
norethynodrel
and
norethisterone
induced
ER
-
beta
-
activating
functions
in
a
dose
-
dependent
manner
.

Luciferase
activity
due
to
estrogen
stimulation
served
as
a
positive
control
.

Our
results
indicate
that
progestins
have
different
effects
on
the
activities
of
ER
-
alpha
and
-
beta
.

Na
(
+
)
-
dependent
transporters
mediate
HCO
(
3
)
(
-
)
salvage
across
the
luminal
membrane
of
the
main
pancreatic
duct
.

To
study
the
roles
of
Na
(
+
)
-
dependent
H
(
+
)
transporters
,
we
characterized
H
(
+
)
efflux
mechanisms
in
the
pancreatic
duct
in
wild
-
type
,
NHE2
(
-
/
-
)
,
and
NHE3
(
-
/
-
)
mice
.

The
pancreatic
duct
expresses
NHE1
in
the
basolateral
membrane
,
and
NHE2
and
NHE3
in
the
luminal
membrane
,
but
does
not
contain
NHE4
or
NHE5
.

Basolateral
Na
(
+
)
-
dependent
H
(
+
)
efflux
in
the
microperfused
duct
was
inhibited
by
1
.
5
microM
of
the
amiloride
analogue
HOE
694
,
consistent
with
expression
of
NHE1
,
whereas
the
luminal
activity
required
50
microM
HOE
694
for
effective
inhibition
,
suggesting
that
the
efflux
might
be
mediated
by
NHE2
.

However
,
disruption
of
NHE2
had
no
effect
on
luminal
transport
,
while
disruption
of
the
NHE3
gene
reduced
luminal
Na
(
+
)
-
dependent
H
(
+
)
efflux
by
approximately
45
%
.

Notably
,
the
remaining
luminal
Na
(
+
)
-
dependent
H
(
+
)
efflux
in
ducts
from
NHE3
(
-
/
-
)
mice
was
inhibited
by
50
microM
HOE
694
.

Hence
,
approximately
55
%
of
luminal
H
(
+
)
efflux
(
or
HCO
(
3
)
(
-
)
influx
)
in
the
pancreatic
duct
is
mediated
by
a
novel
,
HOE
694
-
sensitive
,
Na
(
+
)
-
dependent
mechanism
.

H
(
+
)
transport
by
NHE3
and
the
novel
transporter
is
inhibited
by
cAMP
,
albeit
to
different
extents
.

We
propose
that
multiple
Na
(
+
)
-
dependent
mechanisms
in
the
luminal
membrane
of
the
pancreatic
duct
absorb
Na
(
+
)
and
HCO
(
3
)
(
-
)
to
produce
a
pancreatic
juice
that
is
poor
in
HCO
(
3
)
(
-
)
and
rich
in
Cl
(
-
)
during
basal
secretion
.

Inhibition
of
the
transporters
during
stimulated
secretion
aids
in
producing
the
HCO
(
3
)
(
-
)
-
rich
pancreatic
juice
.

Improvement
of
cardiac
output
in
patients
with
severe
heart
failure
by
use
of
ACE
-
inhibitors
combined
with
the
AT1
-
antagonist
eprosartan
.

BACKGROUND
:
The
efficacy
of
ACE
-
inhibitor
therapy
is
well
documented
in
the
treatment
of
chronic
heart
failure
.

As
pharmacological
mechanisms
of
ACE
-
inhibition
and
angiotensin
II
AT1
-
receptor
-
antagonists
differ
,
an
additional
positive
effect
concerning
left
ventricular
function
can
be
expected
in
combining
both
classes
of
drugs
.

METHODS
:
Twenty
patients
(
64
.
9
+
/
-
8
.
5
years
)
with
advanced
chronic
heart
failure
(
NYHA
class
III
)
receiving
long
-
term
medication
with
digitalis
,
diuretics
and
ACE
-
inhibitors
were
randomized
to
either
eprosartan
(
540
+
/
-
96
mg
/
day
)
or
placebo
,
according
to
a
blinded
protocol
.

Hemodynamic
measurements
by
impedance
cardiography
were
performed
at
baseline
and
after
8
.
85
+
/
-
1
.

5
days
of
study
medication
treatment
.

RESULTS
:
Additional
treatment
with
eprosartan
resulted
in
a
higher
cardiac
output
than
in
the
control
group
(
P
<
0
.
05
)
.

While
in
the
active
treatment
group
cardiac
output
increased
significantly
from
baseline
(
2
.
27
-
3
.
24
l

min
,
P
=
0
.

)
,
there
was
no
change
in
the
control
group
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
The
additional
treatment
with
the
AT1
-
receptor
antagonist
eprosartan
,
given
to
severe
heart
failure
patients
,
who
received
digitalis
,
diuretics
and
ACE
-
inhibitors
,
resulted
in
a
beneficial
effect
by
increasing
cardiac
output
.

This
effect
may
be
due
to
eprosartan
'
s
additional
property
of
blocking
the
autocrine
interaction
of
locally
and
not

-
generated
angiotensin
II
with
their
respective
vascular
and

Gene
expression
of
the
phosphodiesterases
3A
and
5A
in
human
corpus
cavernosum
penis
.

OBJECTIVE
:
The
following
study
was
performed
to
evaluate
the
importance
of
phosphodiesterases
3A
(
PDE3A
)
and
5A
(
PDE5A
)
for
the
regulation
of
penile
smooth
muscle
tone
.

Furthermore
,
indications
of
side
effects
of
specific
inhibitors
in
certain
tissues
as
well
as
of
a
possible
relation
between
the
level
of
PDE3A
and
PDE5A
gene
expression
and
erectile
dysfunction
should
have
been
deduced
from
the
results
obtained
.

METHODS
:
Total
ribonucleic
acid
was
isolated
from
different
human
tissues
(
urogenital
tract
,
gastrointestinal
tract
,
cardiovascular
system
and
central
nervous
system
)
and
subjected
to
RTPCR
analysis
and
Northern
blotting
using
primers
and
probes
specific
for
PDE3A
and
PDE5A
.

RESULTS
:
As
shown
by
RT
-
PCR
and
Northern
blotting
,
PDE3A
and
PDE5A
mRNAs
exhibit
a
distinct
distribution
throughout
the
tissues
examined
but
were
2
-
fold
higher
in
cavernous
tissue
than
in
all
other
tissues
investigated
.

However
,
there
were
no
significant
differences
in
the
levels
of
gene
expression
between
the
two
subgroups
of
patients
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
Very
high
expression
levels
of
PDE3A
and
PDE5A
in
human
cavernous
tissue
underscore
the
physiological
importance
of
these
enzymes
for
the
regulation
of
penile
erection
,
emphasizing
their
therapeutical
and
pharmacological
relevance
.

The
distribution
pattern
of
the
mRNA
for
the
isoenzymes
PDE3A
and
PDE5A
may
explain
the
pharmacological
effects
as
well
as
the
side
effects
of
milrinone
and
sidenafil
.

Effects

Low

in
association
with

has
been
linked
to
an
increased
risk
of

.

We
tested
the
hypothesis
that
troglitazone
,

insulin
sensitivity
and
lowers
plasma

in

would
also

At

Changes

The
extent
of
the
reduction
in
plasma
PAI

antigen
concentrations
in
the
diabetic
patients
after
troglitazone
correlated
with
the
reductions
in

and

)
but
not
with
the
improvement
in

rates
during

.

Three
nonresponders
to
troglitazone
with
respect
to
effects
on
insulin
sensitivity
and
fasting
glucose
and
insulin
levels
also
had
no
reduction
in

1
.

In
conclusion
,
troglitazone
enhances
fibrinolytic
system
activity
in
insulin
-
resistant
type
2
diabetic
patients
.

This
effect
appears
to
be
intimately
linked
to
its
potential
to
lower
plasma
insulin
levels
and
improve
glycemic
control
through
its
peripheral

.

Tetrahydropterin
-
dependent
amino
acid
hydroxylases
.

Phenylalanine
hydroxylase
,
tyrosine
hydroxylase
,
and
tryptophan
hydroxylase
constitute
a
small
family
of
monooxygenases
that
utilize
tetrahydropterins
as
substrates
.

When
from
eukaryotic
sources
,
these
enzymes
are
composed
of
a
homologous
catalytic
domain
to
which
are
attached
discrete
N
-
terminal
regulatory
domains
and
short
C
-
terminal
tetramerization
domains
,
whereas
the
bacterial
enzymes
lack
the
N
-
terminal
and
C
-
terminal
domains
.

Each
enzyme
contains
a
single
ferrous
iron
atom
bound
to
two
histidines
and
a
glutamate
.

Recent
mechanistic
studies
have
begun
to
provide
insights
into
the
mechanisms
of
oxygen
activation
and
hydroxylation
.

Although
the
hydroxylating
intermediate
in
these
enzymes
has
not
been
identified
,
the
iron
is
likely
to
be
involved
.

Reversible
phosphorylation
of
serine
residues
in
the
regulatory
domains
affects
the
activities
of
all
three
enzymes
.

In
addition
,
phenylalanine
hydroxylase
is
allosterically
regulated
by
its
substrates
,
phenylalanine
and
tetrahydrobiopterin
.

Protective
action
of
cardiac
DT
-
diaphorase
against
menadione
toxicity
in
guinea
pig
isolated
atria
.

In
myocardial
preparations
isolated
from
guinea
pigs
,
2
-
methyl
-
1
,
4
-
naphthoquinone
(
menadione
)
causes
an
increase
in
contractility
that
is
strictly
related
to
the
generation
of
reactive
oxygen
species
(
ROS
)
as
a
consequence
of
quinone
metabolism
.

In
heart
,
menadione
undergoes
one
-
electron
reduction
to
semiquinone
,
a
reaction
mainly
catalysed
by
mitochondrial
NADH
:
ubiquinone
oxidoreductase
.

It
is
also
converted
to
hydroquinone
by
the
soluble
two
-
electron
reductase
,
DT
-
diaphorase
,
and
is
conjugated
with
GSH
by
glutathione
S
-
transferase
.

In
order
to
assess
the
role
of
DT
-
diaphorase
in
cardiac
responses
to
menadione
,
we
examined
the
effects
of
both
a
specific
inhibitor
(
dicoumarol
)
and
an
inducer
(
beta
-
naphthoflavone
)
of
the
enzyme
on
the
inotropic
action
of
the
quinone
.

In
electrically
driven
left
atria
of
guinea
pig
,
4
microM
dicoumarol
significantly
enhanced
the
positive
inotropic
effect
of
menadione
,
especially
at
the
lower
concentrations
of
the
quinone
.

In
myocardial
preparations
isolated
from
guinea
pigs
treated
with
beta
-
naphthoflavone
(
80
mg
/
kg
i
.
p
.
for
2
days
)
,
DT
-
diaphorase
activity
was
enhanced
(
+
36
%
with
respect
to
control
animals
,
P
<
0
.
01
)
,
whereas
the
activities
of
the
other
enzymes
involved
in
menadione
metabolism
were
not
modified
.

In
these
preparations
,
menadione
caused
a
significantly
lower
increase
in
the
force
of
contraction
than
in
atria
from
untreated
animals
;
moreover
,
pretreatment
with
beta
-
naphthoflavone
caused
a
significant
decrease
in
the
menadione
-
induced
oxidative
stress
,
as
evaluated
from
the
GSH
redox
index
.

Taken
together
,
these
results
demonstrate
that
cardiac
DT
-
diaphorase
does
not
contribute
to
ROS
generation
,
but
represents
a
detoxification
system
.

The
use
of
leflunomide
in
the
treatment
of
rheumatoid
arthritis
:
an
experimental
and
clinical
review
.

Leflunomide
,
the
newest
disease
-
modifying
antirheumatic
drug
(
DMARD
)
for
the
treatment
of
rheumatoid
arthritis
(
RA
)
,
acts
by
inhibiting
dihydroorotate
dehydrogenase
,
the
rate
-
limiting
enzyme
in
the
pathway
for
pyrimidine
production
.

The
drug
thus
limits
T
-
cell
proliferation
,
a
process
thought
to
be
a
key
step
in
the
pathogenesis
of
RA
.

In
placebo
-
controlled
trials
,
leflunomide
was
superior
to
placebo
and
comparable
to
sulfasalazine
and
methotrexate
for
improving
the
signs
and
symptoms
of
RA
;
and
superior
to
placebo
,
sulfasalazine
,
and
methotrexate
for
improving
health
-
related
quality
of
life
.

In
the
same
trials
,
leflunomide
was
also
superior
to
methotrexate
and
comparable
to
sulfasalazine
for
slowing
radiographically
assessed
progression
of
RA
.

When
used
in
combination
therapy
in
an
open
-
label
trial
,
leflunomide
resulted
in
improvement
for
over
half
of
a
group
of
RA
patients
who
had
failed
to
respond
to
methotrexate
alone
.

The
most
common
adverse
events
associated
with
leflunomide
treatment
were
gastrointestinal
symptoms
,
allergic
reactions
,
alopecia
,
and
elevated
liver
enzyme
levels
.

Adverse
events
were
generally
mild
to
moderate
in
severity
and
resolved
without
sequelae
.

Clinical
trial
results
indicate
that
leflunomide
is
an
efficacious
and
safe
addition
to
the
roster
of
therapeutic
agents
used
to
treat
RA
.

Mechanisms
of
reduced
body
growth
in
the
pubertal
feminized
male
rat
:
unbalanced
estrogen
and
androgen
action
on
the
somatotropic
axis
.

It
is
well
known
that
the
sex
difference
in
body
growth
at
puberty
is
modulated
by
a
complex
interplay
between
sex
steroids
and
somatotropic
axis
;
however
,
the
exact
role
played
by
sex
steroids
remains
a
matter
of
controversy
.

The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
assess
the
mechanisms
by
which
sex
steroids
regulate
body
growth
during
pubertal
development
.

Flutamide
,
a
non
-
steroid
-
blocking
androgen
receptor
,
was
subcutaneously
administered
to
30
-
d
-
old
male
Wistar
rats
for
4
wk
.

The
blockade
of
the
androgen
receptor
led
to
a
marked
elevation
in
serum
testosterone
and
an
increment
in
serum
estradiol
.

Flutamide
administration
decreased
body
weight
gain
,
serum
IGF
-
I
levels
,
hepatic
IGF
-
I
mRNA
,
and
GH
receptor
mRNA
content
.

There
were
no
significant
changes
in
serum
GH
concentration
,
pituitary
GH
reserve
,
and
pituitary
GH
mRNA
content
.

Flutamide
lowered
hypothalamic
somatostatin
mRNA
content
and
augmented
hypothalamic
immunoreactive
somatostatin
stores
,
but
did
not
alter
hypothalamic
immunoreactive
GH
-
releasing
factor
stores
.

Our
findings
indicate
that
during
pubertal
development
of
the
male
rat
,
the
imbalance
between
androgen
and
estrogen
actions
determines
an
abnormal
somatic
growth
,
which
is
at
least
partly
exerted
through
the
peripheral
or
hepatic
modification
of
the
somatotropic
axis
that
occurs
under
the
high
or
exclusive
action
of
estrogens
.

Potential
implication
of
coincident
sex
-
specific
regulated
mode
of
pulsatile
GH
secretion
cannot
be
excluded
from
this
random
serum
GH
sample
study
.

Clinical
pharmacology
,
therapeutic
use
and
potential
of
COMT
inhibitors
in
Parkinson
'
s
disease
.

When
peripheral
decarboxylation
is
blocked
by
carbidopa
or
benserazide
,
the
main
metabolic
pathway
of
levodopa
is
O
-
methylation
by
catechol
-
O
-
methyltransferase
(
COMT
)
.

Entacapone
and
tolcapone
are
new
potent
,
selective
and
reversible
nitrocatechol
-
type
COMT
inhibitors
.

Animal
studies
have
demonstrated
that
entacapone
mainly
has
a
peripheral
effect
whereas
tolcapone
also
inhibits
O
-
methylation
in
the
brain
.

In
human
volunteers
,
both
entacapone
and
tolcapone
dose
-
dependently
inhibit
the
COMT
activity
in
erythrocytes
,
improve
the
bioavailability
and
decrease
the
elimination
of
levodopa
,
and
inhibit
the
formation
of
3
-
O
-
methyldopa
(
3
-
OMD
)
.

Entacapone
is
administered
with
every
scheduled
dose
of
levodopa
whereas
tolcapone
is
administered
3
times
daily
.

The
different
administration
regimens
for
these
agents
are
based
on
their
different
pharmacokinetic
and
pharmacodynamic
profiles
.

Both
entacapone
and
tolcapone
enhance
and
extend
the
therapeutic
effect
of
levodopa
in
patients
with
advanced
and
fluctuating
Parkinson
'
s
disease
.

They
prolong
the
duration
of
levodopa
effect
.

Clinical
studies
show
that
they
increase
the
daily
ON
time
by
an
average
1
to
3
hours
,
improve
the
activities
of
daily
living
and
allow
daily
levodopa
dosage
to
be
decreased
.

Correspondingly
,
they
significantly
reduce
the
daily
OFF
time
.

No
comparative
studies
between
entacapone
and
tolcapone
have
been
performed
.

Tolcapone
also
appears
to
have
a
beneficial
effect
in
patients
with
nonfluctuating
Parkinson
'
s
disease
.

The
main
adverse
effects
of
the
COMT
inhibitors
are
related
to
their
dopaminergic
and
gastrointestinal
effects
.

Enhancement
of
dopaminergic
activity
may
cause
an
initial
worsening
of
levodopa
-
induced
adverse
effects
,
such
as
dyskinesia
,
nausea
,
vomiting
,
orthostatic
hypotension
,
sleep
disorders
and
hallucinations
.

Levodopa
dose
adjustment
is
recommended
to
avoid
these
events
.

Tolcapone
is
associated
with
diarrhoea
in
about
16
to
18
%
of
patients
and
entacapone
in
less
than
10
%
of
patients
.

Diarrhoea
has
led
to
discontinuation
in
5
to
6
%
of
patients
treated
with
tolcapone
and
in
2
.
5
%
of
those
treated
with
entacapone
.

Urine
discoloration
to
dark
yellow
or
orange
is
related
to
the
colour
of
COMT
inhibitors
and
their
metabolites
.

Elevated
liver
transaminase
levels
are
reported
in
1
to
3
%
of
patients
treated
with
tolcapone
but
very
rarely
,
if
at
all
,
in
patients
treated
with
entacapone
.

The
descriptions
of
acute
,
fatal
fulminant
hepatitis
and
potentially
fatal
neurological
reactions
,
such
as
neuroleptic
malignant
syndrome
and
rhabdomyolysis
,
in
association
with
tolcapone
led
to
the
suspension
of
its
marketing
authorisation
in
the
European
Community
and
Canada
.

In
many
other
countries
,
the
use
of
tolcapone
is
restricted
to
patients
who
are
not
responding
satisfactorily
to
other
therapies
.

Regular
monitoring
of
liver
enzymes
is
required
if
tolcapone
is
used
.

No
such
adverse
reactions
have
so
far
been
described
for
entacapone
and
no
laboratory
monitoring
has
been
proposed
.

COMT
inhibitors
added
to
levodopa
therapy
are
beneficial
,
particularly
in
patients
with
fluctuating
disease
.

They
may
be
combined
with
other
antiparkinsonian
drugs
,
such
as
dopamine
agonists
,
selegiline
and
anticholinergics
without
adverse
interactions
.

They
provide
a
new
treatment
possibility
in
patients
with
Parkinson
'
s
disease
who
have
problems
with
their
present
levodopa
therapy
.

Until
now
,
5

have
been
thought
to
inhibit
cholera

by
blockading
5

on

Instead
we
postulated
that
they
act

Intraluminal

proportional
to
the

and
to
the
onset

suggesting
that

reflect
enterochromaffin

inhibited

However
,
granisetron

The
simultaneous
inhibition
of

suggests
that

in

electrophysiological

in
the

.

The
effect
of
a
21

day
treatment
with
the
dual
5
-
HT
and
NE
reuptake
blocker
venlafaxine
(
delivered

)
was
assessed
on
the
time
required
for
a
50

recovery
(
RT
(

)
of
the
firing
activity
of
dorsal

CA
(
3
)
pyramidal
neurons
from
the
suppression
induced
by
microiontophoretic
applications
of
5
-
HT
and
NE
.

The
RT
(
50
)
values
for
5
-
HT
were
increased
by
both
10
and
40
mg
/
kg
/
day
regimens
of
venlafaxine
,
whereas
those
for
NE
were
increased
only
by
the
40
mg
/
kg
/
day
regimen
,
indicative
of
a
greater
potency
of
venlafaxine
in
blocking
5
-
HT
reuptake
.

The
sensitivity
of
the
postsynaptic
5
-
HT
(
1A
)
and
alpha
(
2
)
-
adrenergic
receptors
was
altered
by
neither
regimen
of
venlafaxine
.

Using
a
paradigm
by
which
the
5
-
HT
(
1A
)
antagonist
WAY
100635
can
induce
a
disinhibition
of
firing
activity
of
CA
(
3
)
pyramidal
neurons
,
it
was
demonstrated
that
the
high
,
but
not
the
low
,
dose
of
venlafaxine
led
to
an
enhanced
tonic
activation
of
postsynaptic
5
-
HT
(
1A
)
receptors
in
the
dorsal
hippocampus
.

The
duration
of
the
suppressant
effect
of
the
firing
activity
of
CA
(
3
)
hippocampus
pyramidal
neurons
produced
by
the
electrical
stimulation
of
the
ascending
5
-
HT
pathway
was
significantly
reduced
when
the
frequency
of
the
stimulation
was
enhanced
from
1
Hz
to
5
Hz
in
control
rats
and
in
rats
treated
with
10
mg
/
kg
/
day
,
but
not
with
40
mg
/
kg
/
day
of
venlafaxine
.

Hence
,
venlafaxine
induced
a
desensitization
of
the
terminal
5
-
HT
(
1B
)
autoreceptor
only
at
the
high
dose
.

A
2
-
day
treatment
with
10
mg
/
kg
/
day
of
venlafaxine
induced
a
suppression
of
the
firing
activity
of
5
-
HT
neurons
of
the
dorsal
raphe
.

The
firing
activity
of
these
neurons
was
back
to
control
level
in
rats
that
had
been
treated
for
21
days
with
the
same
dose
of
venlafaxine
.

The
suppressant
effect
of
the
i

v
.
administration
of
the
5
-
HT
autoreceptor
agonist
LSD
on
the
firing
activity
of
dorsal
raphe
5
-
HT
neurons
was
reduced
in
rats
that
had
been
treated
for
21
days
with
10
mg
/
kg
/
day
of
venlafaxine
.

A
2
-
day
treatment
with
40
mg
/
kg
/
day
of
venlafaxine
,
unlike
the
10
mg
/
kg
/
day
regimen
,
induced
a
marked
suppression
of
the
firing
activity
of
locus
coeruleus
NE
neurons
.

However
,
in
contrast
to
5
-
HT
neurons
,
NE
neurons
did
not
recover
their
firing
activity
after
a
21
-
day
treatment
.

Taken
together
,
the
results
from
this
study
indicate
that
the
low
dose
of
venlafaxine
blocked
selectively
the
reuptake
of
5
-
HT
,
whereas
the
high
dose
blocked
the
reuptake
of
both
5
-
HT
and
NE
.

Moreover
,
an
enhancement
of
serotonergic
neurotransmission
by
venlafaxine
was
only
achieved
under
conditions
whereby
the
desensitization
of
the
terminal
5
-
HT
(
1B
)
autoreceptor
is
appended
to
that
of
the
somatodendritic
5

HT
(

)
receptor
.

Phosphoacetylcholinesterase
:
toxicity
of
phosphorus
oxychloride
to
mammals
and
insects
that
can
be
attributed
to
selective
phosphorylation
of
acetylcholinesterase
by
phosphorodichloridic
acid
.

Phosphorus
oxychloride
(
POCl
(
3
)
)
is
an
intermediate
in
the
synthesis
of
many
organophosphorus
insecticides
and
chemical
warfare
nerve
gases
that
are
toxic
to
insects
and
mammals
by
inhibition
of
acetylcholinesterase
(
AChE
)
activity
.

It
was
therefore
surprising
to
observe
that
POCl
(
3
)
,
which
is
hydrolytically
unstable
,
also
itself
gives
poisoning
signs
in
ip
-
treated
mice
and
fumigant
-
exposed
houseflies
similar
to
those
produced
by
the
organophosphorus
ester
insecticides
and
chemical
warfare
agents
.

In
mice
,
POCl
(
3
)
inhibits
serum
butyrylcholinesterase
(
BuChE
)
at
a
sublethal
dose
and
muscle
but
not
brain
AChE
at
a
lethal
dose
.

In
houseflies
,
POCl
(
3
)
-
induced
brain
AChE
inhibition
is
correlated
with
poisoning
and
the
probable
cause
thereof
.

POCl
(
3
)
in
vitro
is
selective
for
AChE
(
IC
(
50
)
=
12
-
36
microM
)
compared
with
several
other
serine
hydrolases
(
BuChE
,
carboxylesterase
,
elastase
,
alpha
-
chymotrypsin
,
and
thrombin
)
(
IC
(
50

=

-
2000
microM
)
.

With
electric
eel
AChE
,
methylcarbamoylation
of
the
active
site
with
eserine
reversibly
protects
against
subsequent
irreversible
inhibition
by
POCl
(
3
)
.

Most
importantly
,
POCl
(
3
)
-
induced
electric
eel
AChE
inhibition
prevents
postlabeling
with
[
(

)
H
]
diisopropyl
phosphorofluoridate
;
i
.
e
.
,
both
compounds
phosphorylate
at
Ser
-

in
the
catalytic
triad
.

Pyridine
-
2
-
aldoxime
methiodide
does
not
reactivate
POCl
(
3
)
-
inhibited
AChE
,
consistent
with
an
anionic
phosphoserine
residue
at
the
esteratic
site
.

The
actual
phosphorylating
agent
is
formed
within
seconds
from
POCl
(
3
)
in
water
,
has
a
half
-
life
of
approximately
2
min
,
and
is
identified
as
phosphorodichloridic
acid
[
HOP
(
O
)
Cl
(
2
)
]
by
(
31
)
P
NMR
and
derivatization
with
dimethylamine
to
HOP
(
O
)
(
NMe
(
2
)
)
(
2
)
.

POCl
(
3
)
on
reaction
with
water
and
HOP
(
O
)
Cl
(
2
)
have
the
same
potency
for
inhibition
of
AChE
from
either
electric
eel
or
housefly
head
as
well
as
the
same
toxicity
for
mice
.

In
summary
,
the
acute
toxicity
of
POCl
(
3
)
is
attributable
to
hydrolytic
activation
to
HOP
(
O
)
Cl
(
2
)
that
phosphorylates
AChE
at
the
active
site
to
form
enzymatically
inactive

decreased

In

In

Concluding

the

PARTICIPANTS
:
506
men
who

from
5661
men
aged
40

MEASURES
:
Plasma

.

Information
on
fatal

was
obtained
from
medical

.

RESULTS
:
Compared
with
men
in
the
bottom
third
of
baseline
measurements
of

,
men
in
the
top

had
an

were
observed
of
these

were
significantly
associated
with
one

,
although
the
association
between
low

was
weaker
(

.

CONCLUSION
:
In
the
context
of
results
from
other
relevant
studies
these
findings
suggest
that
some
inflammatory
processes
,
unrelated
to
the
chronic

studied
here
,
are
likely
to
be
involved
in
coronary

Evaluation
of
in

binding
properties
of
3H

and
3H

QNB
in
mouse
brain
.

UNLABELLED
:
Apparent
muscarinic
acetylcholine
(
mAch
)
receptor
occupancy
in
mouse
cerebral
cortex
,
hippocampus
,
and
striatum
by
scopolamine
,
an
antagonist
,
and
biperiden
,
a
relatively
selective
M1
antagonist
,
was
estimated
with
competitive
binding
studies
using
two
different
radioligands
:
3H
-
N
-
methyl
piperidyl
benzilate
(
3H
-
NMPB
)
and
3H
-
quinuclidinyl
benzilate
(
3H
-
QNB
)
.

Both
radioligands
labeled
mAch
receptors
in
these
brain
regions
,
and
the
relative
regional
distributions
of
the
specific
binding
of
3H
-
NMPB
in
vivo
paralleled
the
distribution
of
mAch
receptors
.

3H
-
NMPB
binding
in
vivo
was
much
more
sensitive
to
direct
competitive
inhibition
by
scopolamine
than
was
3H
-
QNB
.

A
similar
discrepancy
in
sensitivity
to
competitors
between
3H
-
NMPB
and
3H
-
QNB
was
also
observed
when
biperiden
was
used
as
a
competitor
,
indicating
that
binding
to
different
subtypes
of
the
mAch
receptor
could
not
account
for
the
observed
differences
in
sensitivity
to
competition
.

An
in
vivo
saturation
study
suggested
that
the
apparent
association
rate
constant
(
k
on
)
of
3H
-
QNB
binding
might
be
changed
by
ligand
concentration
.

The
heterogeneity
of
the
free
ligand
concentration
in
intact
brain
was
assessed
in
relation
to
the
ligand
concentration
dependency
of
the
apparent
association
rate
constant
(
k
on
)
of
3H
-
QNB
binding
.

This
finding
,
together
with
the
more
favorable
accumulation
of
3H
-
NMPB
in
cerebral
cortex
,
hippocampus
,
and
striatum
,
leads
us
to
conclude
that
3H
-
NMPB
,
or
its
positron
emitting
counterpart
,
should
be
the
more
favorable
radiotracer
for
the
estimation
of
mAch
receptor
occupancy
by
cholinergic
drugs
in
the
brain
.

Modulation
of
KCNQ2
/
3
potassium
channels
by
the
novel
anticonvulsant
retigabine
.

Retigabine
is
a
novel
anticonvulsant
with
an
unknown
mechanism
of
action
.

It
has
recently
been
reported
that
retigabine
modulates
a
potassium
channel
current
in
nerve
growth
factor
-
differentiated
PC12
cells
(
)
,
however
,
to
date
the
molecular
correlate
of
this
current
has
not
been
identified
.

In
the
present
study
we
have
examined
the
effects
of
retigabine
on
recombinant
human
KCNQ2
and
KCNQ3
potassium
channels
,
expressed
either
alone
or
in
combination
in
Xenopus
oocytes
.

Application
of
10
microM
retigabine
to
oocytes
expressing
the
KCNQ2
/
3
heteromeric
channel
shifted
both
the
activation
threshold
and
voltage
for
half
-
activation
by
approximately
20
mV
in
the
hyperpolarizing
direction
,
leading
to
an
increase
in
current
amplitude
at
test
potentials
between
-
80
mV
and
+
20
mV
.

Retigabine
also
had
a
marked
effect
on
KCNQ
current
kinetics
,
increasing
the
rate
of
channel
activation
but
slowing
deactivation
at
a
given
test
potential
.

Similar
effects
of
retigabine
were
observed
in
oocytes
expressing
KCNQ2
alone
,
suggesting
that
KCNQ2
may
be
the
molecular
target
of
retigabine
.

Membrane
potential
recordings
in
oocytes
expressing
the
KCNQ2
/
3
heteromeric
channel
showed
that
application
of
retigabine
leads
to
a
concentration
-
dependent
hyperpolarization
of
the
oocyte
,
from
a
resting
potential
of
-
63
mV
under
control
conditions
to
-
85
mV
in
the
presence
of
100
microM
retigabine
(
IC
(
50
)
=
5
.
2
microM
)
.

In
control
experiments
retigabine
had
no
effect
on
either
resting
membrane
potential
or
endogenous
oocyte
membrane
currents
.

In
conclusion
,
we
have
shown
that
retigabine
acts
as
a
KCNQ
potassium
channel
opener
.

Because
the
heteromeric
KCNQ2
/
3
channel
has
recently
been
reported
to
underlie
the
M
-
current
,
it
is
likely
that
M
-
current
modulation
can
explain
the
anticonvulsant
actions
of
retigabine
in
animal
models
of
epilepsy
.

Impaired

during
lactation
:
fibrates
and
troglitazone
reverse
lactation
-
induced
downregulation
of
the
uncoupling
protein
-
3
gene
.

The
expression
of
uncoupling
protein
(
UCP
)
-
3
mRNA
in
skeletal
muscle
is
dramatically
reduced
during
lactation
in
mice
.

The
reduction
in
UCP
-
3
mRNA
levels
lowers
the
amount
of
the
UCP
-
3
protein
in
skeletal
muscle
mitochondria
during
lactation
.

Spontaneous
or
abrupt
weaning
reverses
the
downregulation
of
the
UCP
-
3
mRNA
but
not
the
reduction
in
UCP
-
3
protein
levels
.

In
lactating
and
virgin
mice
,
however
,
fasting
increases
UCP
-
3
mRNA
levels
.

Changes
in
UCP
-
3
mRNA
occur
in
parallel
with
modifications
in
the
levels
of
free
fatty
acids
,
which
are
reduced
in
lactation
and
are
upregulated
due
to
weaning
or
fasting
.

Modifications
in
the
energy
nutritional
stress
of
lactating
dams
achieved
by
manipulating
litter
sizes
do
not
influence
UCP
-
3
mRNA
levels
in
skeletal
muscle
.

Conversely
,
when
mice
are
fed
a
high
-
fat
diet
after
parturition
,
the
downregulation
of
UCP
-
3
mRNA
and
UCP
-
3
protein
levels
due
to
lactation
is
partially
reversed
,
as
is
the
reduction
in
serum
free
fatty
acid
levels
.

Treatment
of
lactating
mice
with
a
single
injection
of
bezafibrate
,
an
activator
of
the
peroxisome
proliferator
-
activated
receptor
(
PPAR
)
,
raises
UCP
-
3
mRNA
in
skeletal
muscle
to
levels
similar
to
those
in
virgin
mice
.

,
a
specific
ligand
of
the
PPAR

subtype
,
causes
the
most
dramatic
increase
in
UCP

3
mRNA
,
whereas
troglitazone
,
a
specific
activator
of
PPAR

gamma
,
also
significantly
increases
UCP

3
mRNA
abundance
in
skeletal
muscle
of
lactating
mice
.

However
,
in
virgin
mice
,
bezafibrate
and
WY
-
14
,
643
do
not
significantly
affect
UCP
-
3
mRNA
expression
,
whereas
troglitazone
is
at
least
as
effective
as
it
is
in
lactating
dams
.

It
is
proposed
that
the
UCP
-
3
gene
is
regulated
in
skeletal
muscle
during
lactation
in
response
to
changes
in
circulating
free
fatty
acids
by
mechanisms
involving
activation
of
PPARs
.

The
impaired
expression
of
the
UCP
-
3
gene
is
consistent
with
the
involvement
of
UCP
-
3
gene
regulation
in
the
reduction
of
the
use
of
fatty
acids
as
fuel
by
the
skeletal
muscle
and
in
impaired
adaptative
thermogenesis
,
both
of
which
are
major
metabolic
adaptations
that
occur
during
lactation
.

Hypertrophic
effect
of
selective
beta
(

)
-
adrenoceptor
stimulation
on
ventricular
cardiomyocytes
from
adult
rat
.

We
investigated
whether
selective
beta
(
1
)
-
adrenoceptor
stimulation
causes
hypertrophic
growth
on
isolated
ventricular
cardiomyocytes
from
adult
rat
.

As
parameters
for
the
induction
of
hypertrophic
growth
,
the
increases
of
[
(
14
)
C
]
phenylalanine
incorporation
,
protein
and
RNA
mass
,
and
cell
size
were
determined
.

Isoproterenol
(
Iso
,
10
microM
)
alone
had
no
growth
effect
.

In
the
presence
of
the
beta
(
2
)
-
adrenoceptor
antagonist
ICI
-
118551
(
ICI
,
10
microM
)
,
Iso
caused
an
increase
in
[
(
14
)
C
]
phenylalanine
incorporation
,
protein
and
RNA
mass
,
cell
volume
,
and
cross
-
sectional
area
.

We
showed
for
phenylalanine
incorporation
that
the
growth
effect
of
Iso
+
ICI
could
be
antagonized
by
beta
(
1
)
-
adrenoceptor
blockade
with
atenolol
(
10
microM
)
or
metoprolol
(
10
microM
)
,
indicating
that
it
was
caused
by
selective
beta
(
1
)
-
adrenoceptor
stimulation
.

The
growth
response
to
Iso
+
ICI
was
accompanied
by
an
increase
in
ornithine
decarboxylase
(
ODC
)
activity
and
expression
.

Inhibition
of
ODC
by
the
ODC
antagonist
difluoromethylornithine
(
1
mM
)
attenuated
this
hypertrophic
response
,
indicating
that
ODC
induction
is
causally
involved
.

The
growth
response
to
Iso
+
ICI
was
found
to
be
cAMP
independent
but
was
sensitive
to
genistein
(
100
microM
)
or
rapamycin
(
0
.
1
microM
)
.

The
reaction
was
enhanced
in
the
presence
of
pertussis
toxin
(
10
microM
)
.

We
conclude
that
selective
beta
(
1
)
-
adrenoceptor
stimulation
causes
hypertrophic
growth
of
ventricular
cardiomyocytes
by
a
mechanism
that
is
independent
of
cAMP
but
dependent
on
a
tyrosine
kinase
and
ODC
.

Hyperphenylalaninemia

/

:
analysis
of
enzyme
activity
in
intestinal
biopsies
.

Hyperphenylalaninemia
,
which
can
cause
neurological
disorders
and
mental
retardation
,
results
from
a
mutation
in
phenylalanine
hydroxylase
or
an
enzyme
required
for
biosynthesis
or
regeneration
of
its
cofactor
,
tetrahydrobiopterin
.

The
hyperphenylalaninemia
variant
primapterinuria
is
characterized
by
the
excretion
of
7
-
biopterin
(
primapterin
)
.

This
disorder
is
thought
to
be
due
to
a
deficiency
of
4a
-
hydroxy
-
tetrahydrobiopterin
dehydratase
(
pterin
-
4a
-
carbinolamine
dehydratase
)
,
but
a
lack
of
tissue
activity
has
not
been
directly
demonstrated
.

The
five
mutations
so
far
recognized
in
patients
with
primapterinuria
are
associated
with
either
a
single
amino
acid
change
or
a
premature
stop
codon
.

Only
C81R
has
been
successfully
expressed
in
soluble
form
,
and
was
found
to
have
40
%
of
normal
activity
.

Tissues
which
could
be
obtained
by
minimally
invasive
procedures
were
analyzed
for
dehydratase
activity
.

None
was
detected
in
normal
human
white
cells
or
fibroblasts
.

However
,
activity
was
found
in
intestine
of
rat
,
dog
,
pig
,
and
particularly
humans
where
it
was
only
eight
times
lower
than
in
liver
.

Distribution
along
the
length
and
across
the
wall
of
small
intestine
was
relatively
uniform
.

Moreover
,
the
dehydratases
from
human
liver
and
intestinal
mucosa
have
identical
kinetic
properties
.

A
biopsy
of
duodenal
mucosa
from
a
patient
with
homozygous
E96K
dehydratase
had
activity
of
55
nmol
.

.

min
(
-
1
)
g
(
-

tissue
in
controls
(
n

)
.

The
sixfold
lower
tissue
activity
of
the
E96K
mutant
alone
may
not
be
sufficient
to
account
for
the
biochemical
symptoms
of
primapterinuria
in
this
patient
.

However
,
accumulation
of
a
4a
-
hydroxy
-
tetrahydrobiopterin
degradation
product
(
a
side
-
chain
cyclic
adduct
)
,
which
has
been
observed
in
vitro
and
appears
to
be
a
dehydratase
inhibitor
,
may
further
exacerbate
the
problem
.

Effects

Rat
.

The
limited
entry
of
interleukin
-
1beta
(
IL
-
1beta
)
into
the
central
nervous
system
has
led
to
the
hypothesis
that
IL
-
1beta
acts
,
through
IL
-
1beta
receptors
located
notably
on
endothelial
cells
,
on
the
release
of
prostaglandins
which
in
turn
stimulate
the
hypothalamic
-
pituitary
-
adrenal
(
HPA
)
axis
.

We
used
cyclo

oxygenase
-
1
(
COX

)
and
cyclo
-
oxygenase
-
2
(
COX

)
and
5

lipoxygenase
(

-
LOX
)
inhibitors
,
before
the
injection
of
IL
-
1beta
,
to
explore
the
role
of
arachidonic
acid
metabolic
pathways
on
HPA
axis
activation
.

Adult

were

injected

;
or
(

(

)
.

Following
this
,
rats
were
killed
90
min
after

.

IL
-
1beta
injection
and
analysis
for
plasma
adrenocorticotropic
hormone
(
ACTH
)
and
corticosterone
concentrations
and
determination
of
anterior
pituitary
pro
-
opio
melanocortin
(
POMC
)
gene
transcription
was
conducted
.

Administration
of
the
COX
-
1
/
COX
-
2
inhibitor
led
to
a
complete
blockage
of
ACTH
and
corticosterone
secretion
and
POMC
gene
transcription
.

The
COX
-
2
inhibitor
led
to
a
complete
blockade
of
ACTH
secretion
and
POMC
gene
transcription
but
had
no
effect
on
corticosterone
secretion
.

The
5
-
LOX
inhibitor
had
no
significant
effect
on
any
parameter
.

These
results
demonstrate
the
crucial
role
of
eicosanoid
pathways
in
mediating
the
stimulation
of
the
HPA
axis
induced
by
IL
-
1beta
.

Moreover
,
we
found
a
clear
dissociation
of
the
effect
of
the
blockage
of
COXs
upon
ACTH
and
corticosterone
secretion
,
suggesting
that
IL
-
1beta
may
act
at
the
brain
as
well
as
at
the
adrenal
cortex
to
stimulate
the
secretion
of
corticosterone
.

Drug
treatment
of
obesity
.

Drugs
to
treat
obesity
can
be
divided
into
three
groups
:
those
which
reduce
food
intake
,
those
which
alter
metabolism
and
those
which
increase
thermogenesis
.

Monoamines
acting
on
noradrenergic
receptors
,
serotonin
receptors
,
dopamine
receptors
and
histamine
receptors
can
reduce
food
intake
.

A
number
of
peptides
also
affect
food
intake
.

The
noradrenergic
drugs
phentermine
,
diethylpropion
,
mazindol
benzphetamine
and
phendimetrazine
are
approved
only
for
short
-
term
use
.

Sibutramine
,
a
norepinephrine
-
serotonin
re
-
uptake
inhibitor
,
is
approved
for
long
-
term
use
.

Orlistat

pancreatic
lipase
and
can
block
30
%
of
triglyceride
hydrolysis

The
only
thermogenic
drug

that
has
been
tested
is
ephedrine
and
caffeine
,
but
this
treatment
has
not
been
approved

from
death
.

These
central
components
biochemically
intermingle
in
a
ternary
complex
recently
dubbed
the
"
apoptosome
.
"
The
C

protein
EGL
-
1
and
its
mammalian
counterparts
,
pro
-
apoptotic
members
of
the
bcl
-
2
family
,
induce
cell
death
by
disrupting
apoptosome
interactions
.

Thus
,
EGL
-
1
may
represent
a
primordial
signal
integrator
for
the
apoptosome
.

Various
biochemical
processes
including
oligomerization
,
adenosine
triphosphate
ATP
/
dATP
binding
,
and
cytochrome
c
interaction
play
a
role
in
regulating
the
ternary
death
complex
.

Recent
studies
suggest
that
cell
death
receptors
,
such
as
CD95
,
may
amplify
their
suicide
signal
by
activating
the
apoptosome
.

These
mutual
associations
by
core
components
of
the
suicide
apparatus
provide
a
molecular
framework
in
which
diverse
death
signals
likely
interface
.

Understanding
the
apoptosome
and
its
cellular
connections
will
facilitate
the
design
of
novel
therapeutic
strategies
for
cancer
and
other
disease
states
in
which
apoptosis
plays
a
pivotal
role

.

However
,
the
mechanism
of
action
of
CMA

has
not
been
well
elucidated

The

and
the

was
investigated
by
cell

were
done
by

A

was
observed
in

that
expressed

,
restored
the
cytotoxic

676
is
a

The
combined

may
increase
the

Retigabine

anticonvulsant
,
unrelated
to

antiepileptic
agents
,
with
activity
in

broad
range
of

In
the
present

we
sought
to

whether
retigabine
could

In

,
retigabine
enhanced

The
effect
of
retigabine
was
associated
with
a
slowing
of

in

Retigabine

also
slowed
the

predominantly
by

Our
findings
identify
KCNQ2

suggest
that

Interaction
of
flavodoxin
with
cobalamin
-
dependent
methionine
synthase
.

Cobalamin
-
dependent
methionine
synthase
catalyzes
the
transfer
of
a
methyl
group
from
methyltetrahydrofolate
to
homocysteine
,
forming
tetrahydrofolate
and
methionine
.

The
Escherichia
coli
enzyme
,
like
its
mammalian
homologue
,
is
occasionally
inactivated
by
oxidation
of
the
cofactor
to
cob
(
II
)
alamin
.

To
return
to
the
catalytic
cycle
,
the
cob
(
II
)
alamin
forms
of
both
the
bacterial
and
mammalian
enzymes
must
be
reductively
remethylated
.

Reduced
flavodoxin
donates
an
electron
for
this
reaction
in
E
.
coli
,
and
S
-
adenosylmethionine
serves
as
the
methyl
donor
.

In
humans
,
the
electron
is
thought
to
be
provided
by
methionine
synthase
reductase
,
a
protein
containing
a
domain
with
a
significant
degree
of
homology
to
flavodoxin
.

Because
of
this
homology
,
studies
of
the
interactions
between
E
.
coli
flavodoxin
and
methionine
synthase
provide
a
model
for
the
mammalian
system
.

To
characterize
the
binding
interface
between
E
.
coli
flavodoxin
and
methionine
synthase
,
we
have
employed
site
-
directed
mutagenesis
and
chemical
cross
-
linking
using
carbodiimide
and
N
-
hydroxysuccinimide
.

Glutamate
61
of
flavodoxin
is
identified
as
a
cross
-
linked
residue
,
and
lysine
959
of
the
C
-
terminal
activation
domain
of
methionine
synthase
is
assigned
as
its
partner
.

The
mutation
of
lysine
959
to
threonine
results
in
a
diminished
level
of
cross
-
linking
,
but
has
only
a
small
effect
on
the
affinity
of
methionine
synthase
for
flavodoxin
.

Identification
of
these
cross
-
linked
residues
provides
evidence
in
support
of
a
docking
model
that
will
be
useful
in
predicting
the
effects
of
mutations
observed
in
mammalian
homologues
of
E
.
coli
flavodoxin
and
methionine
synthase

SYNTHESIS
:
Entacapone
is
the
second
medication
of
a
new
class
of
drugs
,
the
catechol
-
O
-
methyltransferase
inhibitors
,
indicated
for
clinical
use
as
an
adjunct
to
levodopa
/
carbidopa
to
treat
patients
with
idiopathic
Parkinson
'
s
disease
who
experience
the
signs
and
symptoms
of
end
-
of
-
dose

-
off
.

Entacapone
in
combination
with
levodopa
/
dopa
decarboxylase
inhibitor
has
been
shown
to
increase
the
AUC
of
levodopa
,
which
leads
to
less
fluctuation
of
levodopa
plasma
concentrations
.

Clinically
,
the
duration
of
motor
response
to
levodopa
was
prolonged
as
reflected
by
an
increase
in
the
mean
on
time
.

The
addition
of
entacapone
resulted
in
a
decrease
in
the
mean
daily
dosage
of
levodopa
.

The
recommended
dosage
of
entacapone
is
200
mg
administered
orally
with
each
dose
of
levodopa
/
carbidopa
,
up
to
a
maximum
of
eight
doses
per
day
.

Common
adverse
effects
include
dyskinesia
,
nausea
,
diarrhea
,
and
urine
discoloration
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
Entacapone
should
be
considered
as
add

Bupropion
is
a
nicotinic
antagonist
.

Neuronal
nicotinic
receptors
are
ligand
-
gated
ion
channels
of
the
central
and
peripheral
central
nervous
system
that
regulate
synaptic
activity
from
both
pre
-
and
postsynaptic
sites
.

The
present
study
establishes
the
acute
interaction
of
bupropion
,
an
antidepressant
agent
that
is
also
effective
in
nicotine
dependence
,
with
nicotine
and
nicotinic
receptors
using
different
in
vivo
and
in
vitro
tests
.

Bupropion
was
found
to
block
nicotine
'
s
antinociception
(
in
two
tests
)
,
motor
effects
,
hypothermia
,
and
convulsive
effects
with
different
potencies
in
the
present
investigation
,
suggesting
that
bupropion
possesses
some
selectivity
for
neuronal
nicotinic
receptors
underlying
these
various
nicotinic
effects
.

In
addition
,
bupropion
blocks
nicotine
activation
of

than
alpha
(

)
This
functional
blockade
was
noncompetitive
,
because
it
was
insurmountable
by
increasing
concentration
of
ACh
in
the
nAChRs
subtypes
tested
.

Furthermore
,
bupropion
at
high
concentration
failed
to

]
nicotine
binding
sites
,
a
site
largely
composed
of
alpha
(
4
)
beta
(
2
)
subunit
combination
.

Given
the
observation
that
bupropion
inhibition
of
alpha
(

)
beta
(
2
)
and
alpha
(
4
)
beta

receptors
exhibits

independence
properties
,
bupropion
may
not
be
acting
as
an
open
channel
blocker
.

These
effects
may
explain
in
part
bupropion
'
s
efficacy
in
nicotine
dependence
.

Our
present
findings
suggest
that
functional
blockade
of
neuronal
nAChRs
are
useful
in

Leukotriene
B
(

)
(
LTB
(

)
)
is
a
product
of
eicosanoid
metabolism
and
acts
as
an
extremely
potent
chemotactic
mediator
for
inflammation
.

LTB
(
4
)
exerts
positive
effects
on
the
immigration
and
activation
of
leukocytes
.

These
effects
suggest
an
involvement
of
LTB
(

)
in
several
diseases
:
inflammatory

disease
,
psoriasis
,
arthritis
,
and

.

LTB
(

elicits
actions
through
interaction
with
one
or
more
cell
surface
receptors
that
lead
to
chemotaxis
and

.

One
leukotriene

receptor
has
been
recently
identified
(

In

aid
in
further
understanding
the
roles

By
using
the
technique
of
site

directed
spin
labeling
combined
with
EPR
spectroscopy
,
we
have
observed
that
binding
of
arachidonic

induces
conformational
changes
in
the
human
prostaglandin

was
used
to
calculate
the
inter

helical
distances
and
changes
in
these
distances
that
occur
in
response
to
binding
various

.

The

determined
for
the

using

were
1

A
shorter
than
those
of
the
crystal

of
the

However
,

calculated

determined
by

for
PGHS

complexed
with
arachidonic

were
in
close

with
those
obtained

These
results
indicate
that
the
structure
of
the
solubilized

measured
in
solution
differs
from
the
crystal
structure
of
PGHS
-

holoenzyme
obtained
by

analysis
.

Furthermore
,
binding
of
ligands
induces
a
conformational
change
in
the
holo
-
PGHS
-
2
,
converting
it
to
a
structure
similar
to
those
obtained
by

Proteolysis

assays
had
previously
provided
circumstantial
evidence
that
binding
of
heme
and
non

drugs
alters
the
conformation
of
PGHS
,
but
the
present
experiments
are
the
first
to
directly
measure
such
changes
.

The
finding
that
arachidonate
can
also
induce
a
conformational
change
in
PGHS
-
2
was
unexpected
,
and
the
magnitude
of
changes
suggests
this
structural
flexibility
may
be
integral
to
the
cyclooxygenase

mechanism
.

A
comparison
of
the
effects
of
etodolac
and
ibuprofen
on
renal
haemodynamics
,
tubular
function
,
renin
,
vasopressin
and
urinary
excretion
of
albumin
and
alpha
-
glutathione
-
S
-
transferase
in
healthy
subjects
:
a
placebo
-
controlled
cross
-
over
study
.

BACKGROUND
:
Non
-
steroidal
anti
-
inflammatory
drugs
(
NSAIDs
)
are
known
to
be
potentially
nephrotoxic
agents
.

NSAIDs
inhibit
the
enzyme
cyclo
-
oxygenase
and
thereby
block
the
prostaglandin
synthesis
in
the
kidneys
.

Cyclo
-
oxygenase
exists
in
two
isoforms
(
COX
-
1
and
COX
-
2
)
.

It
has
been
proposed
that
NSAIDs
with
preferential
COX
-
2
selectivity
have
fewer
renal
side
effects
than
drugs
with
preferential
COX
-
1
selectivity
.

Etodolac
is
a
relative
selective
inhibitor
of
COX
-
2
,
while
ibuprofen
has
a
higher
potency
against
COX
-
1
than
COX
-
2
.

OBJECTIVE
:
In
this
study
,
we
compared
the
effects
of
etodolac
and
ibuprofen
on
renal
function
,
plasma
renin
,
plasma
arginine
vasopressin
and
the
urinary
excretion
of
albumin
and
alpha
-
glutathione
-
S
-
transferase
(
alpha
-
GST
)
.

METHODS
:
In
a
randomised
,
double
-
blind
,
three
-
way
crossover
study
with
placebo
,
we
compared
the
effects
of
2
weeks
of
treatment
with
ibuprofen
and
etodolac
on
renal
haemodynamics
[
glomerular
filtration
rate
(
GFR
)
,
renal
plasma
flow
(
RPF
)
and
filtration
fraction
(
FF
)
]
,
tubular
function
and
plasma
concentrations
of
the
hormones
renin
(
PRC
)
and
arginine
vasopressin
(
AVP
)
in
18
healthy
subjects
.

In
addition
,
we
examined
the
effects
on
the
urinary
excretion
of
albumin
and
alpha
-
GST
as
markers
of
renal
injury
.

RESULTS
:
No
differences
were
found
between
the
three
treatments
,
placebo
,
ibuprofen
and
etodolac
,
in
the
effects
on
GFR
,
RPF
,
FF
,
free
water
clearance
,
urinary
output
or
fractional
excretion
of
potassium
and
sodium
.

However
,
ibuprofen
,
in
contrast
to
etodolac
,
caused
a
significant
decrease
in
both
lithium
clearance
(
-
16
%
versus
placebo
)
and
the
fractional
excretion
of
lithium
(
-
17
%
versus
placebo
)
,
suggesting
an
increase
in
the
reabsorption
in
the
proximal
tubuli
.

PRC
was
reduced
significantly
by
ibuprofen
(
-
32
%
versus
placebo
)
but
not
etodolac
.

None
of
the
drugs
changed
AVP
.

Fourteen
days
of
treatment
with
ibuprofen
caused
a
significant
decrease
(
-
47
%
versus
placebo
)
in
the
urinary
excretion
of
alpha
-
GST
,
while
no
changes
were
seen
after
etodolac
.

None
of
the
drugs
changed
the
urinary
excretion
of
albumin
.

CONCLUSION
:
In
conclusion
,
a
14
-
day
administration
of
etodolac
or
ibuprofen
in
therapeutic
doses
did
not
affect
the
renal
haemodynamics
,
the
net
excretion
of
electrolytes
or
the
urinary
excretion
of
albumin
in
healthy
subjects
.

However
,
ibuprofen
,
in
contrast
to
etodolac
,
caused
a
reduction
in
PRC
,
suggesting
that
COX
-
1
is
involved
in
basal
renin
release
in
humans
.

Furthermore
,
ibuprofen
decreased
lithium
excretion
suggesting
that
COX
-
1
is
involved
in
the
re
-
absorption
of
sodium
and
/
or
water
in
the
proximal
tubuli
.

The
reduction
in
the
urinary
excretion
of
alpha
-
GST
by
ibuprofen
may
be
caused
by
an
inhibition
of
the
detoxification
enzyme
by
ibuprofen
.

Overall
the
study
indicates
that
only
small
differences
in
the
effects
of
the
two
drugs
on
renal
function
in
healthy
subjects
exist
during
a
treatment
period
of
2
weeks
.

Tyrosine

located
in
the
active

was
replaced

had
a
marginal
effect
on
the
k
(
cat

value
determined
using
S

D
-
lactoylglutathione
as
substrate
.

However
,
the
Y175F
mutant
had
an
8
-
fold
higher
K
(
m
)
value
than
the
wild

type
enzyme
.

The
competitive
inhibitor
S
-
(
N

N
-
bromophenylcarbamoyl
)
glutathione
had
a
30
-
fold
higher
K
(
i
)
value
towards
the
mutant
,
than
that
of
the
wild
-
type
.

Pre
-
equilibrium
fluorescence
studies
with
the
inhibitor
showed
that
this
was
due
to
a
significantly
increased
off
-
rate
for
the
mutant
enzyme
.

The
phenolic
hydroxyl
group
of
tyrosine
-
175
is
within
hydrogen
bonding
distance
of
the
amide
nitrogen
of
the
glycine
in
the
glutathione
moiety
and
the
present
study
shows
that
this
interaction
makes
a
significant
contribution
to
the
binding
of
the
active

ligand
.

Beneficial

We
examined
the
effects
of
omapatrilat
in
a
placebo

controlled
crossover
study
using
a
pacing
model
of
HF
.

Seven
sheep
were
paced
sequentially
at
180
bpm
(
mild

)
and
then
225

for
7
days
each
.

Omapatrilat

)
or

was
administered
by
intravenous
bolus
on
days
4
to
7
of
each
paced
period
.

Omapatrilat
lowered
mean
arterial

left
atrial
pressure
and
increased
cardiac
output
acutely
and
chronically
in
both
mild
and
severe
HF
(
P

for
all
)
.

Plasma
atrial
and
brain
natriuretic
peptide
and
cGMP
levels
were
stable
acutely
(
P

)
,
while
brain
natriuretic
peptide
increased
after
repeated
dosing
in
severe
HF
(
P
<
0
.
05
)
.

Plasma
renin
activity
rose
,
whereas
angiotensin

and
aldosterone
levels
fell
after
acute
and
repeated
dosing
in
both
states
(
P
<
0
.
01
for
all
)
.

Omapatrilat
increased
urinary
sodium
excretion
by
day
7
in
both
mild
and
severe
HF
(
P
<
0
.
05
)
.

Effective
renal
plasma
flow
and
glomerular
filtration
rate
increased
or
were
stable
after
omapatrilat
in
mild
and
severe
HF
after
both
acute
and
repeated
dosing
.

Omapatrilat
exhibited
pronounced
acute
and
sustained
beneficial
hemodynamic
and
renal
effects
in
both

A
comparison
of
agonist

of

.

The
agonist
-
specific
coupling
properties
of
the
three
cloned
human
alpha
(
2
)
-
adrenoceptor
subtypes
have
been
compared
,
when
expressed
at
similar
levels
in
Chinese
hamster
ovary
(
CHO
)
cell
lines
,
using
noradrenaline
and
(
+
/
-
)
-
meta
-
octopamine
as
agonists
.

Noradrenaline
can
couple
the
receptor
to
both
the
inhibition
and
stimulation
of
forskolin
-
stimulated
cyclic
AMP
production
in
all
three
receptor
subtypes
,
with
the
relative
strength
of
the
coupling
to
the
pathways
varying
for
each
of
the
receptor
subtypes
.

meta
-
Octopamine
selectively
couples
the
alpha
(
2A
)
-
adrenoceptor
only
to
the
inhibition
of
forskolin
-
stimulated
cyclic
AMP
production
.

However
,
meta
-
octopamine
couples
the
alpha
(
2B
)
-
and
alpha
(
2C
)
-
adrenoceptors
to
both
the
inhibition
and
stimulation
of
forskolin
-
stimulated
cyclic
AMP
production
.

The
relative
potency
of
meta
-
octopamine
to
noradrenaline
varies
between
the
different
alpha
(
2
)
-
adrenoceptor
subtypes
.

The
effects
of
meta
-
octopamine
are
around
two
orders
of
magnitude
less
potent
than
those
of
noradrenaline
on
both
the
alpha
(
2A
)
-
and
alpha
(
2B
)
-
adrenoceptor
subtypes
.

In
contrast
,
in
the
case
of
the
alpha
(
2C
)
-
adrenoceptor
,
meta
-
octopamine
is
only
one
order
of
magnitude
less
potent
than
noradrenaline
in
the
stimulation
of
forskolin
-
stimulated
cyclic
AMP
production
and
,
in
addition
,
is
equipotent
with
noradrenaline
in
the
inhibition
of
forskolin
-
stimulated
cyclic
AMP
production
and
has
an
increased
maximal
response
.

This
raises
the
possibility
that
meta
-
octopamine
may
have
physiologically
important
actions
via
alpha
(
2C
)
-
adrenoceptors
in
vivo
.

The
results
show
that
the
modulation
of
cyclic
AMP
production
occurs
in
both
a
subtype
-
and
agonist
-
specific
manner
for
alpha
(
2A
)
-
adrenoceptors
and
in
a
subtype
specific
manner
for
alpha
(
2B
)
-
and

)

.

Suppression
of
NF

kappaB
activity
by
sulfasalazine
is
mediated
by
direct
inhibition
of
IkappaB
kinases
alpha
and

.

BACKGROUND
&
AIMS
:
Activation
of
NF
-
kappaB
/
Rel
has
been
implicated
in
the
pathogenesis
of
inflammatory
bowel
disease
(
IBD
)
.

Various
drugs
used
in
the
treatment
of
IBD
,
such
as
glucocorticoids
,
5
-
aminosalicylic
acid
,
and
sulfasalazine
,
interfere
with
NF
-
kappaB
/
Rel
signaling
.

The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
define
the
molecular
mechanism
by
which
sulfasalazine
inhibits
NF
-
kappaB
activation
.

METHODS
:
The
effects
of
sulfasalazine
and
its
moieties
on
NF
-
kappaB
signaling
were
evaluated
using
electromobility
shift
,
transfection
,
and
immune
complex
kinase
assays
.

The
direct
effect
of
sulfasalazine
on
IkappaB
kinase
(
IKK
)
activity
was
investigated
using
purified
recombinant
IKK
-
alpha
and
-
beta
proteins
.

RESULTS
:

or
constitutively
active
IKK

beta
mutants
was
inhibited
dose
dependently
by
sulfasalazine
.

Sulfasalazine
inhibited

induced
activation
of
endogenous
IKK
in
Jurkat

and
SW620
colon
cells
,
as
well
as
the
catalytic
activity
of
purified
IKK
-
alpha
and
IKK
-
beta
in

.

In
contrast
,
the
moieties
of
sulfasalazine
,
5
-
aminosalicylic
acid
,
and
sulfapyridine
or
4
-
aminosalicylic
acid
had
no
effect
.

Activation
of

,
c
-
Jun
-
N
-
terminal
kinase
(
JNK
)
1
,
and
p38
was
unaffected
by
sulfasalazine
.

The
decrease
in
substrate
phosphorylation
by
IKK
-
alpha
and
-
beta
is
associated
with
a
decrease
in
autophosphorylation
of
IKKs
and
can
be
antagonized
by
excess
adenosine
triphosphate
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
These
data
identify
sulfasalazine
as
a
direct
inhibitor
of
IKK
-
alpha
and
-
beta
by
antagonizing
adenosine
triphosphate
binding
.

The
suppression
of
NF
-
kappaB
activation
by
inhibition
of
the
IKKs
contributes
to
the
well
-
known
anti
-
inflammatory
and
immunosuppressive
effects
of
sulfasalazine
.

Physiologically
,
AKR1C1
regulates
progesterone
action
by
converting
the
hormone
into
its
inactive
metabolite
20alpha

hydroxyprogesterone
,
and
toxicologically
this
enzyme
activates
polycyclic

.

However
,
the
significance
of
its
potent
induction
by
Michael

and

is
unknown

were
reduced
by
AKR1C1
with
high

.

Kinetic
studies
revealed
that
AKR1C1
reduced

with
a
k

similar
to
that
for
20alpha
-
hydroxysteroids
.

Six
other
homogeneous
recombinant
AKRs
were
examined
for
their
ability
to
reduce
HNE
.

Of
these
,
AKR1C1
possessed
one
of
the
highest
specific
activities
and
was
the
only
isoform
induced
by
oxidative
stress
and
by
agents
that
deplete
glutathione
(
ethacrynic
acid
)
.

Several
hydroxysteroid
dehydrogenases
of
the
AKR1C
subfamily
catalyzed
the
reduction
of
HNE
with
higher
activity
than
aldehyde
reductase
(
AKR1A1
)
.

NMR
spectroscopy
identified
the
product
of
the
NADPH
-
dependent
reduction
of
HNE
as
1
,
4
-
dihydroxy
-

The

)
suggested
that
it
is
primed
for
reductive
metabolism
of
HNE
.

Isoform
-
specific
reverse
transcription
-
polymerase
chain
reaction
showed
that
exposure
of
HepG2
cells
to
HNE
resulted
in
elevated
levels
of
AKR1C1
mRNA
.

Thus
,
HNE
induces
its
own
metabolism
via
AKR1C1
,
and
this
enzyme
may
play
a
hitherto
unrecognized
role
in
a
response
mounted
to
counter
oxidative
stress
.

AKRs
represent
alternative
GSH
-
independent
/
NADPH
-
dependent
routes
for
the
reductive
elimination
of
HNE
.

Of
these
,
AKR1C1
provides
an
inducible
cytosolic
barrier
to
HNE
following
ROS
exposure
.

)
,
generated
by

)
from
immunostimulated

during

,
plays
an
important
role
in
host

against

.

The
impact
of
different
rates
of

on

function
has
not
been
defined
.

Herein
,
we
describe
the
development
of
a
method
to
express
varied
levels
of
murine
NOS
II
in
bovine
pulmonary
artery
endothelial
cells
.

A
retroviral
vector
(
pMFGSNOS
)
encoding
NOS
II
was
used
to
transduce
primary
cultures
of
endothelial
cells
.

Bovine
endothelial
cells
were
susceptible
to
this
transduction
and
up
to
18
%
of
the
cells
expressed
immunodetectable
murine
NOS
II
.

The
NOS
II
-
transduced
endothelial
cells
were
cultured
on
the
three
-
dimensional
matrix
,
Gelfoam
,
for
8
-
10
days
.

Stable
expression
of
NOS
II
was
assessed
by
measuring
nitrite
accumulation
in
media
every
2
days
.

By
day
10
,
endothelial
cells
on
Gelfoam
were
found
to
secrete
NO

at
a
rate
exceeding

Argininosuccinate
synthetase
,
a
key
enzyme
in
the

of

,
increased
as
well
,
perhaps
in
response
to
dimunition
of
the
intracellular
arginine
pool
corresponding
to
the
observed
high
output
of
NO
*
.

In
spite
of
the
continuous
flux
of
NO
*
,
endothelial
cell
viability
was
not
effected
.

This
system
provides
the
opportunity
to
assess
the
impact
of
different
levels
of
sustained
NO

production
on
endothelial

Effects
of
eletriptan
on
the
peptidergic
innervation
of
the
cerebral
dura
mater
and
trigeminal
ganglion
,
and
on
the
expression
of
c
-
fos
and
c
-
jun
in
the
trigeminal
complex
of
the
rat
in
an
experimental

model
.

Nociceptive
axons
and
terminals
in
the
supratentorial
cerebral
dura

display
an
intense
calcitonin
gene
-
related
peptide
(
CGRP
)
immunoreactivity
.

In
an
experimental
migraine
model
,
it
has
been
shown
that
electrical
stimulation
of
the
rat
trigeminal
ganglion
induced
an
increase
in
the
lengths
of
CGRP
-
immunoreactive
axons
,
increased
size
and
number
of
pleomorphic
axonal
varicosities
in
the
dura
mater
,
and
an
increased
number
of
c
-
jun
and
c
-
fos
protein
-
expressing
nerve
cells
in
the
trigeminal
complex
.

We
demonstrate
the
effect
of
the
highly
specific
and
moderately
lipophilic
serotonin
agonist
eletriptan
(
Pfizer
)
which
prevents
the
effects
of
electrical
stimulation
in
the
dura
mater
.

Eletriptan
also
affected
the
caudal
trigeminal
complex
;
it
markedly
reduced
the
numbers
of
the
oncoprotein
-
expressing
cells
,
mainly
after
stimulation
and
to
some
extent
also
in
nonstimulated
animals
.

Eletriptan
also
affected
expression
of
CGRP
in
perikarya
of
trigeminal
ganglion
cells
,
insofar
as
the
number
of
small
nerve
cells
exhibiting
a
compact
CGRP
immunoreaction
was
decreased
to
one
quarter
of
the
original
value
.

In
all
these
respects
,
eletriptan
acted
in
a
similar
way
to
sumatriptan
,
with
the
notable
exception
that
eletriptan
also
blocked
the
stimulation
-
induced
effects
in
the
nucleus
caudalis
trigemini
and
the
upper
cervical
spinal
cord
(
trigeminal
complex
)
,
whereas
sumatriptan
did
not
.

It
is
concluded
that
eletriptan
,
acting
on
perikarya
and
both
the
peripheral
and
the
central
axon
terminals
of
primary
sensory
neurons
,
exerts
its
antimigraine
effect
by
an
agonist
action
on
5
-
HT1B
/
1D
receptors
throughout
the
entire
trigeminal
system
,
probably
by
passing
the
blood
-
brain
-
barrier
because
of
its
lipophilic
character
.

of
the
cDNA
,
properties
of
the
recombinant
enzyme
,
and
immunohistochemical
localization
in
human
skin
.

Peptidylarginine
deiminase
catalyzes
the
post
-
translational
modification
of
proteins
through
the
conversion
of
arginine
to
citrulline
in
the
presence
of
calcium
ions
.

In
rodents
,
peptidylarginine
deiminase
has
been
classified
into
four
isoforms
,
types
I
,
II
,
III
,
and
IV
,
which
are
distinct
in
their
molecular
weights
,
substrate
specificities
,
and
tissue
localization
.

Of
these
isoforms
,
only
type
III
was
detected
in
epidermis
and
hair
follicles
.

Although
the
role
of
this
enzyme
in
these
tissues
is
not
yet
clear
,
indirect
data
have
shown
that
several
structural
proteins
such
as
filaggrin
,
trichohyalin
,
and
keratin
are
substrates
for
peptidylarginine
deiminase
.

In
this
study
,
we
cloned
the
full
-
length
cDNA
of
human
peptidylarginine
deiminase
type
III
(
3142
bp
)
from
cultured
human
keratinocytes
by
reverse
transcription
-
polymerase
chain
reaction
and
by
rapid
amplification
of
cDNA

methods
.

This
cDNA
contained
a
1995
bp
open
reading
frame
encoding
664
amino
acids
(
Mr
=

)
.

To
explore
the
physicochemical
and
enzymatic
properties
of
human
peptidylarginine
deiminase
type
III
,
we
constructed
a
plasmid
for
producing
a
recombinant
human
peptidylarginine
deiminase
type
III
in
bacteria
.

The
enzymatic
characteristics
of
the
recombinant
enzyme
were
very
similar
to
those
of
the
rodent
peptidylarginine
deiminase
type
III
.

The
recombinant
enzyme
showed
the
catalytic
activities
toward
structural
proteins
of
epidermis
and
hair
follicle
,
filaggrin
and
trichohyalin
,
in
which
the
deiminations
maxima
of
about
60
%
and
13
%
arginine
residues
were
observed
in
filaggrin
and
trichohyalin
,
respectively
.

An
immunohistochemical
study
of
human
scalp
skin
with
a
monospecific
anti
-
peptidyl
-
arginine
deiminase
type
III
antibody
revealed
that
the
type
III
enzyme
was
localized
to
the
inner
root
sheath
and
outer
root
sheath
of
hair
follicles
.

Peptidylarginine
deiminase
type
III
in
the
inner
root
sheath
was
notable
between
supramatrix
and
keratogenous
zone
and
was
scarcely
detected
in
cornified
hair
zone
.

The
enzyme
was
also
expressed
in
the
cuticle
layer
of
hair
.

On
the
other
hand
,
expression
of
the
enzyme
in
the
epidermis
was
very
low
.

These
data
imply
that
human
peptidylarginine
deiminase
type
III
is
the
predominant
isoform
in
hair
follicles
and
may
function
as
a
modulator
of
hair
structural
proteins
,
including
trichohyalin
during
hair
and
hair
follicle
formation
.

Coinduction
of
inducible
nitric
oxide
synthase
and
arginine
recycling
enzymes
in
cytokine
-
stimulated
PC12
cells
and
high
output
production
of
nitric
oxide
.

Nitric
oxide
(
NO
)
is
involved
in
many
physiological
and
pathological
processes
in
the
brain
.

NO
is
synthesized
from
arginine
by
nitric
oxide
synthase
(
NOS
)
,
and
the
citrulline
generated
as
a
by
-
product
can
be
recycled
to
arginine
by
argininosuccinate
synthetase
(
AS
)
and
argininosuccinate
lyase
(
AL
)
via
the
citrulline
-
NO
cycle
.

When
neuronal
PC12
cells
differentiated
with
nerve
growth
factor
were
treated
with
interferon
-
gamma
(
IFNgamma
)
and
tumor
necrosis
factor
-
alpha
(
TNFalpha
)
,
iNOS
and
AS
mRNAs
and
proteins
were
markedly
induced
,
with
AL
mRNA
and
protein
being
weakly
induced
.

Cationic
amino
acid
transporter
-
1
and
-
2
were
not
induced
.

IFNgamma
or
TNFalpha
alone
was
ineffective
.

A
large
amount
of
NO
(
190
microM
NO
(
2
)
(
-
)
plus
NO
(
3
)
(
-
)
in
culture
medium
in
24
h
)
was
produced
from
arginine
by
cytokine
-
stimulated
cells
,
and
arginine
could
be
replaced
by
citrulline
.

iNOS
induction
and
NO
production
were
attenuated
by
dexamethasone
and
dibutyryl
cAMP
and
even
more
strongly
so
when
combined
.

The
new
cholinesterase
inhibitors
for
Alzheimer
'
s
disease
,
Part
1
:
their
similarities
are
different
.

Three
new
cholinesterase
inhibitors
,
donepezil
,
rivastigmine
,
and
galantamine
,
all
inhibit
the
enzyme
AChE
.

Rivastigmine
also
inhibits
BuChE
,
which
could
lead
to
additional
benefits
in
late
-
stage
Alzheimer
'
s
disease
,
but
also
cause
more
GI
side
effects
at
initiation
of
therapy
.

Galantamine
is
also
an
allosteric
modulator
of
nicotinic
receptors
,
which
could
lead
to
additional
efficacy
for
attention
and
for
behaviors
mediated
by
neurotransmitters
other
than
ACh
.

We
are
now
entering
an
exciting
era
where
the
options
for
treating
the
devastating
illness
Alzheimer
'
s
disease
are
multiplying
and
creating
a
foundation
upon
which
new
therapies
with
new
mechanisms
of
action
can
be
built
.

Biochemistry
of
cyclooxygenase
(
COX
)
-
2
inhibitors
and
molecular
pathology
of
COX
-
2
in
neoplasia
.

Several
types
of
human
tumors
overexpress
cyclooxygenase
(
COX
)
-
2
but
not
COX
-
1
,
and
gene
knockout
transfection
experiments
demonstrate
a
central
role
of
COX
-
2
in
experimental
tumorigenesis
.

COX
-
2
produces
prostaglandins
that
inhibit
apoptosis
and
stimulate
angiogenesis
and
invasiveness
.

Selective
COX
-
2
inhibitors
reduce
prostaglandin
synthesis
,
restore
apoptosis
,
and
inhibit
cancer
cell
proliferation
.

In
animal
studies
they
limit
carcinogen
-
induced
tumorigenesis
.

In
contrast
,
aspirin
-
like
nonselective
NSAIDs
such
as
sulindac
and
indomethacin
inhibit
not
only
the
enzymatic
action
of
the
highly
inducible
,
proinflammatory
COX
-
2
but
the
constitutively
expressed
,
cytoprotective
COX
-
1
as
well
.

Consequently
,
nonselective
NSAIDs
can
cause
platelet
dysfunction
,
gastrointestinal
ulceration
,
and
kidney
damage
.

For
that
reason
,
selective
inhibition
of
COX
-
2
to
treat
neoplastic
proliferation
is
preferable
to
nonselective
inhibition
.

Selective
COX
-
2
inhibitors
,
such
as
meloxicam
,
celecoxib
(
SC
-
58635
)
,
and
rofecoxib
(
MK
-
0966
)
,
are
NSAIDs
that
have
been
modified
chemically
to
preferentially
inhibit
COX
-
2
but
not
COX
-
1
.

For
instance
,
meloxicam
inhibits
the
growth
of
cultured
colon
cancer
cells
(
HCA
-
7
and
Moser
-
S
)
that
express
COX
-
2
but
has
no
effect
on
HCT
-
116
tumor
cells
that
do
not
express
COX
-
2
.

NS
-
398
induces
apoptosis
in
COX
-
2
expressing
LNCaP
prostate
cancer
cells
and
,
surprisingly
,
in
colon
cancer
S
/
KS
cells
that
does
not
express
COX
-
2
.

This
effect
may
due
to
induction
of
apoptosis
through
uncoupling
of
oxidative
phosphorylation
and
down
-
regulation
of
Bcl
-
2
,
as
has
been
demonstrated
for
some
nonselective
NSAIDs
,
for
instance
,
flurbiprofen
.

COX
-
2
mRNA
and
COX
-
2
protein
is
constitutively
expressed
in
the
kidney
,
brain
,
spinal
cord
,
and
ductus
deferens
,
and
in
the
uterus
during
implantation
.

In
addition
,
COX
-
2
is
constitutively
and
dominantly
expressed
in
the
pancreatic
islet
cells
.

These
findings
might
somewhat
limit
the
use
of
presently
available
selective
COX
-
2
inhibitors
in
cancer
prevention
but
will
probably
not
deter
their
successful
application
for
the
treatment
of
human
cancers
.

Sulfonylurea
sensitivity
of
adenosine
triphosphate
-
sensitive
potassium
channels
from
beta
cells
and
extrapancreatic
tissues
.

Sulfonylureas
are
widely
used
to
stimulate
insulin
secretion
in
type
2
diabetic
patients
because
they
close
adenosine
triphosphate
-
sensitive
potassium
(
K
(
ATP
)
)
channels
in
the
pancreatic
beta
-
cell
membrane
.

This
action
is
mediated
by
binding
of
the
drug
to
the
sulfonylurea
receptor
(
SUR1
)
subunit
of
the
channel
.

K
(
ATP
)
channels
are
also
present
in
a
range
of
extrapancreatic
tissues
,
but
many
of
these
contain
an
alternative
type
of
SUR
subunit
(
SUR2A
in
heart
and
SUR2B
in
smooth
muscle
)
.

The
sulfonylurea
-
sensitivity
of
K
(
ATP
)
channels
containing
the
different
types
of
SUR
is
variable
:
gliclazide
and
tolbutamide
block
the
beta
cell
,
but
not
the
cardiac
or
smooth
muscle
types
of
K
(
ATP
)
channels
with
high
affinity
.

Glibenclamide
and
glimepiride
,
on
the
other
hand
,
block
channels
containing
SUR1
and
SUR2
with
similar
affinity
.

The
reversibility
of
the
different
sulfonylureas
also
varies
.

Tolbutamide
and
gliclazide
produce
a
reversible
inhibition
of
Kir6
.
2
/
SUR1
and
Kir6
.
2
/
SUR2
channels
,
whereas
glibenclamide
has
a
reversible
effect
on
cardiac
,
but
not
beta
-
cell
,
K
(
ATP
)
channels
.

In
this
article
,
we
summarize
current
knowledge
of
how
sulfonylureas
act
on
K
(
ATP
)
channels
containing
the
different
types
of
sulfonylurea
receptor
,
and
discuss
the
implications
of
these
findings
for
the
use
of
sulfonylureas
in
the
treatment
of
diabetes
mellitus
.

Determination
of
residues
in
the
norepinephrine
transporter
that
are
critical
for
tricyclic
antidepressant
affinity
.

The
norepinephrine
(
NET
)
and
dopamine
(
DAT
)
transporters
are
highly
homologous
proteins
,
displaying
many
pharmacological
similarities
.

Both
transport
dopamine
with
higher
affinity
than
norepinephrine
and
are
targets
for
the
psychostimulants
cocaine
and
amphetamine
.

However
,
they
strikingly
contrast
in
their
affinities
for
tricyclic
antidepressants
(
TCA
)
.

Previous
studies
,
based
on
chimeric
proteins
between
DAT
and
NET
suggest
that
domains
ranging
from
putative
transmembrane
domain
(
TMD
)
5
to
8
are
involved
in
the
high
affinity
binding
of
TCA
to
NET
.

We
substituted
24
amino
acids
within
this
region
in
the
human
NET
with
their
counterparts
in
the
human
DAT
,
resulting
in
22
different
mutants
.

Mutations
of
residues
located
in
extra
-
or
intracytoplasmic
loops
have
no
effect
on
binding
affinity
of
neither
TCA
nor
cocaine
.

Three
point
mutations
in
TMD6
(
F316C
)
,
-
7
(
V356S
)
,
and
-
8
(
G400L
)
induced
a
loss
of
TCA
binding
affinity
of
8
-
,
5
-
,
and
4
-
fold
,
respectively
,
without
affecting
the
affinity
of
cocaine
.

The
triple
mutation
F316C
/
V356S
/
G400L
produced
a
40
-
fold
shift
in
desipramine
affinity
.

These
three
residues
are
strongly
conserved
in
all
TCA
-
sensitive
transporters
cloned
in
mammalian
and
nonmammalian
species
.

A
strong
shift
in
TCA
affinity
(
IC
(
50
)
)
was
also
observed
for
double
mutants
F316C
/
D336T
(
35
-
fold
)
and
S399P
/
G400L
(
80
-
fold
for
nortriptyline
and
1000
-
fold
for
desipramine
)
.

Reverse
mutations
P401S
/
L402G
in
hDAT
did
not
elicit
any
gain
in
TCA
affinities
,
whereas
C318F
and
S358V
resulted
in
a
3
-
and
10
-
fold
increase
in
affinity
,
respectively
.

Our
results
clearly
indicate
that
two
residues
located
in
TMD6
and
-
7
of
hNET
may
play
an
important
role
in
TCA
interaction
and
that
a
critical
region
in
TMD8
is
likely
to
be
involved
in
the
tertiary
structure
allowing
the
high
affinity
binding
of
TCA
.

Lyprinol
:
anti
-
inflammatory
and
uterine
-
relaxant
activities
in
rats
,
with
special
reference
to
a
model
for
dysmenorrhoea
.

Lyprinol
exhibits
anti
-
inflammatory
activity
distinct
from
that
of
most
NSAIDs
,
controlling
chronic
but
not
acute
inflammation
.

Unlike
Cox
-
1
inhibitors
(
aspirin
,
meclofenamic
acid
)
it
is
not
gastro
-
toxic
.

Predosing
rats
with
Lyprinol
can
modify
both
(
i
)
the
spontaneous
and
(
ii
)
the
oxytocin
-
induced
contractions
of
the
uterus
.

In
humans
there
is
anecdotal
evidence
that
Lyprinol
can
relieve
dysmenorrhea
.

This
report
explores
the
concept
that
the
uterotrophic
actions
of
Lyprinol
are
conditioned
by
:
the
intrinsic
profile
of
estrogenic
hormones
and
progestagens
and
,
certain
extrinsic
stimuli
.

Evidence
from
in
vitro
studies
indicates
that
Lyprinol
is
not
a
smooth
muscle
relaxant
and
that
its
uterotrophic
mechanism
is
not
that
of
a
cyclo
-
oxygenase
inhibitor
,
but
may
mimic
that
of
a
leukotriene
receptor
antagonist
.

NMDA
and
glutamate
evoke
excitotoxicity
at
distinct
cellular
locations
in
rat
cortical
neurons
in
vitro
.

The
development
of
cortical
neurons
in
vivo
and
in
vitro
is
accompanied
by
alterations
in
NMDA
receptor
subunit
expression
and
concomitant
modifications
in
the
pharmacological
profile
of
NMDA
-
activated
ionic
currents
.

For
example
,
we
observed
that
with
decreasing
NR2B
/
NR2A
subunit
expression
ratio
,
the
block
of
NMDA
receptor
-
mediated
whole
-
cell
responses
by
the
NR2B
-
selective
antagonist
haloperidol
was
also
decreased
.

In
mature
cultures
(
>
22
d
in
vitro
)
,
however
,
NMDA
responses
obtained
from
excised
nucleated
macropatches
,
which
comprised
a
large
portion
of
the
soma
,
remained
strongly
antagonized
by
haloperidol
.

These
results
suggest
that
in
more
mature
neurons
NR1
/
NR2B
receptors
appear
to
be
preferentially
expressed
in
the
cell
body
.

As
predicted
from
the
whole
-
cell
recording
pharmacological
profile
,
NMDA
-
induced
toxicity
was
largely
unaffected
by
haloperidol
in
mature
cultures
.

However
,
haloperidol
effectively
blocked
glutamate
toxicity
in
the
same
cultures
,
suggesting
that
the
neurotoxic
actions
of
this
amino
acid
were
mostly
due
to
the
activation
of
somatic
NMDA
receptors
.

In
experiments
in
which
the
potency
of
glutamate
toxicity
was
increased
by
the
transport
inhibitor
l
-
trans
-
pyrrolidine
-
2
,
4
-
dicarboxylic
acid
,
the
neuroprotective
effects
of
haloperidol
were
significantly
diminished
.

This
was
likely
because
of
the
fact
that
glutamate
,
now
toxic
at
much
lower
concentrations
,
was
able
to
reach
and
activate
dendritic
receptors
under
these
conditions
.

These
results
strongly
argue
that
exogenous
glutamate
and
NMDA
normally
induce
excitotoxicity
at
distinct
cellular
locations
in
mature
mixed
neuronal
cultures
and
that
NR1
/
NR2B
receptors
remain
an
important
component
in
the
expression
of
glutamate
,
but
not
NMDA
-
induced
excitotoxicity
.

against
quipazine

induced

,
whereas
MDL

151

.

This
suggests
that
the

is
mediated
by
5
-
HT2C
receptors
,
while
quipazine
-
induced
head

are
mediated
primarily
by
5

HT2A
receptors
.

The
effects
on

were
comparable
to
previously

Clozapine
showed
similar
potencies
in
both

,
while
sertindole
,
olanzapine
and
risperidone
inhibited
quipazine
-
induced

more
potently
than
the

exerted
a

preference
for

,
we

:
the

To

attributable
to
complete
inhibition
of
either
AAAD
activity
or
the
serotonin
synthetic
pathway
.

In
further
evaluating
potential
applications
of
these
findings
with
carbidopa
,
we
determined
that
sublethal
doses
of
carbidopa
produced
additive
cytotoxic
effects
in
carcinoid
cells
in
combination
with
etoposide
and
cytotoxic
synergy
in
SCLC
cells
when
coincubated
with
topotecan
.

Role

Previous
studies
in
our
laboratory
have
shown
that
the
phase
III
efflux
transporter
multidrug
-
resistance
protein
(
MRP
)
1
can
act
synergistically
with
the
phase
II
conjugating
glutathione
S
-
transferases
(
GST
)
to
confer
resistance
to
the
toxicities
of
some
electrophilic
drugs
and
carcinogens
.

To
determine
whether
the
distinct
efflux
transporter
MRP2
could
also
potentiate
GST
-
mediated
protection
from
electrophilic
toxins
,
we
examined
the
effect
of
regulatable
GSTP1
-
1
expression
in
MRP2
-
rich
HepG2
cells
on
4
-
nitroquinoline

-
oxide
(
4NQO
)
-
induced
cytotoxicity
and
genotoxicity
(
nucleic

formation
)
.

Expression
of
GSTP1
-
1
was
associated
with
a
fourfold
to
tenfold
protection
from
4NQO
-
induced
cytotoxicity
.

result
indicating
that
