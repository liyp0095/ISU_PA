Abstract

Prediction
of
biliary
excretion
is
a
challenge
due
to
the
lack
of
in
vitro
assays
.

Our
laboratory
previously
demonstrated
a
highly
significant
correlation
between
in
vitro
IC
(
50
)
values
against
mrp2
using
rat
canalicular
liver
plasma
membrane
vesicles
and
in
vivo
biliary
excretion
(
Colombo
et
al
.

,

)
.

This
study
explores
the
possibility
of
predicting
in
vivo
biliary
excretion
in
human
using
membrane
vesicles
prepared
from
MDCKII
cells
transfected
with
human
ABCC2
.

.

In

MRP2
activity
was
determined
by
measuring
the
ATP-dependent
uptake
of
5
(

)
-carboxy-2'
,
7'-dichlorofluorescein
(
CDCF
)
in
inside-out

isolated
from

cells
.

in
humans
was
observed
using

well-documented
drugs
covering

to

.

This
study
demonstrates
,
for
the
first
time
,
that
inhibition
of
CDCF
uptake
in
MDCKII-ABCC2
vesicles
not
only
provides
a
screening
assay
to
assess
MRP2
drug-drug
interaction
potential
,
but
is
also
predictive
of
human
MRP2-mediated
biliary
excretion
.
The
human
HDAC
(
histone
deacetylase
)
family
,
a
well-validated
anticancer
target
,
plays
a
key
role
in
the
control
of
gene
expression
through
regulation
of
transcription
.

While
HDACs
can
be
subdivided
into
three
main
classes
,
the
class
I
,
class
II
and
class
III
HDACs
(
sirtuins
)
,
it
is
presently
unclear
whether
inhibiting
multiple
HDACs
using
pan-HDAC
inhibitors
,
or
targeting
specific
isoforms
that
show
aberrant
levels
in
tumours
,
will
prove
more
effective
as
an
anticancer
strategy
in
the
clinic
.

To
address
the
above
issues
,
we
have
tested
a
number
of
clinically
relevant
HDACis
(
HDAC
inhibitors
)
against
a
panel
of
rhHDAC
(
recombinant
human
HDAC
)
isoforms
.

Eight
rhHDACs
were
expressed
using
a
baculoviral
system
,
and
a
Fluor
de
Lystrade
mark
(
Biomol
International
)
HDAC
assay
was
optimized
for
each
purified
isoform
.

The
potency
and
selectivity
of
ten
HDACs
on
class
I
isoforms
(
rhHDAC1
,
rhHDAC2
,
rhHDAC3
and
rhHDAC8
)
and
class
II
HDAC
isoforms
(
rhHDAC4
,
rhHDAC6
,
rhHDAC7
and
rhHDAC9
)
was
determined
.

MS-275
was
HDAC1-selective
,
MGCD0103
was
HDAC1-
and
HDAC2-selective
,
apicidin
was
HDAC2-
and
HDAC3-selective
and
valproic
acid
was
a
specific
inhibitor
of
class
I
HDACs
.

The
hydroxamic
acid-derived
compounds
(
trichostatin
A
,
NVP-LAQ824
,
panobinostat
,
ITF2357
,
vorinostat
and
belinostat
)
were
potent
pan-HDAC
inhibitors
.

The
growth-inhibitory
effect
of
the
HDACis
on
HeLa
cells
showed
that
both
pan-HDAC
and
class-I-specific
inhibitors
inhibited
cell
growth
.

The
results
also
showed
that
both
pan-HDAC
and
class-I-specific
inhibitor
treatment
resulted
in
increased
acetylation
of
histones
,
but
only
pan-HDAC
inhibitor
treatment
resulted
in
increased
tubulin
acetylation
,
which
is
in
agreement
with
their
activity
towards
the
HDAC6
isoform
.

The
effects
of
catecholamines
on
ciliary
motility
of
canine
bronchial
epithelium
was
studied
by
a
photoelectric
method
in
vitro
.

Addition
of
beta-adrenoceptor
agonists
increased
ciliary
beat
frequency
,
a
rank
order
of
potency
being
salbutamol
>
or
=
BRL
37344
,
a
selective
beta
3-adrenoceptor
agonist
>
norepinephrine
.

The
response
to
BRL
37344
was
relatively
resistant
to
the
blockade
of
beta
1-
and
beta
2-adrenoceptors
but
was
competitively
antagonized
by
the
beta
3-adrenoceptor
antagonist
cyanopindolol
,
with
the
pA2
value
being
lower
than
that
when
salbutamol
was
used
as
an
agonist
.

These
results
suggest
that
beta
3-adrenoceptors
exist
in
canine
bronchial
epithelium
and
that
stimulation
of
this
receptor
subtype
may
enhance
ciliary
motility
and
,
hence
,
mucociliary
transport
in
the
airway
.
Enzyme
expression
profiles
suggest
the
novel
tumor-activated
fluoropyrimidine
carbamate
capecitabine
(

might
be
effective
against
papillary
thyroid
cancers
of
children
and
young
adults
.
Anti-platelet
therapy
is
a
useful
strategy
to
prevent
acute
thromboembolic
artery
occlusions
.

This
study
was
designed
to
assess
the
efficacy
of
seselin
derivatives
against
murine
pulmonary
thromboembolism
,
bleeding
time
,
platelet
activation
and
thrombosis
.

Administration
of
C3
(
16
mg
/
kg
)
offered
70%
protection
against
collagen-
and
epinephrine-induced
pulmonary
thromboembolism
and
30%
protection
against
arachidonic
acid-induced
death
in
mice
,
without
adversely
affecting
bleeding
time
.

No
significant
difference
was
observed
by
C3
in
ferric
chloride-induced
arterial
thrombosis
in
rats
.

Significant
reduction
in
thrombus
weight
was
observed
in
arteriovenous
shunt
model
.

In
rat
PRP
,
C3
reduced
ADP
and
collagen-induced
platelet
aggregation
.

In
chronic
hamster
model
of
dyslipidemia
,
administration
of
C3
(
16
mg
/
kg
p
.

o
.

for
90
days
)
had
no
effect
on
plasma
lipids
,
vasoreactivity
and
platelet
adhesion
.

C3
fed
hamsters
showed
reduced
whole-blood
aggregation
response
to
ADP
and
collagen
compared
to
HC-fed
hamsters
.

In
addition
,
C3
augmented
thrombin
time;
however
,
time
to
occlusion
was
not
increased
.

These
results
convincingly
demonstrated
that
C3
is
a
novel
molecule
that
reduces
the
risk
of
thrombosis
and
alleviates
prothrombotic
state
associated
with
hyperlipidemia
without
any
adverse
effect
on
bleeding
time
.

The
high
benefit
/
risk
ratio
of
this
compound
makes
it
a
suitable
candidate
for
future
valid
studies
.
Vardenafil
(
Levitra
)
,
recently
launched
in
Belgium
by
Bayer
and
Glaxo-SmithKline
,
is
a
new
drug
that
potently
and
selectively
inhibits
phosphodiesterase
type
5
(
PDE5
)
in
the
cavernosum
tissue
of
the
penis
.

Inhibition
of
PDE5
blocks
the
hydrolysis
of
cyclic
guanosine
monophosphate
(
GMPc
)
and
results
in
increased
arterial
blood
flow
leading
to
enlargement
of
the
corpus
cavernosum
and
resulting
in
erection
.

In
controlled
clinical
trials
,
vardenafil
at
least
doubled
the
rate
of
successful
erections
as
compared
to
placebo
,
whatever
the
evaluation
parameter
considered
and
the
subgroup
of
patients
studied
.

Vardenafil
is
thus
indicated
in
the
treatment
of
patients
with
erectile
dysfunction
.

It
is
presented
as
5
,
10
and
20
mg
tablets
and
the
usual
dose
is
10
mg
to
be
ingested
25
to
60
minutes
before
sexual
activity
.

Vardenafil
has
a
more
potent
inhibitory
activity
of
PDE5
in
vitro
than
sildenafil
or
tadalafil
while
its
pharmacokinetics
in
vivo
is
somewhat
more
rapid
than
that
of
the
two
other
compounds
.

The
dosage
of
vardenafil
may
be
reduced
to
5
mg
(
especially
in
older
individuals
)
to
improve
tolerance
or
be
increased
up
to
20
mg
(
especially
in
the
presence
of
organic
diseases
aggravating
erectile
dysfunction
)
to
improve
efficacy
.

Contra-indications
(
co-administration
with
drugs
increasing
nitric
oxide
)
and
side-effects
(
headache
and
flushing
due
to
vasodilatation
)
of
vardenafil
are
similar
to
those
of
other
PDE5
inhibitors
.

The
susceptibility
of
developing
immune
system
to
chemical
disruption
warrants
the
assessment
of
immune
parameters
in
reproductive
and
developmental
testing
protocols
.

In
this
study
,
a
wide
range
of
immune
endpoints
was
included
in
an
extended
one-generation
reproduction
toxicity
study
(
EOGRTS
)
design
to
determine
the
relative
sensitivity
of
immune
and
developmental
parameters
to
ethanol
(
EtOH
)
,
a
well-known
developmental
toxicant
with
immunomodulatory
properties
.

Adult
Wistar

were
exposed
to
EtOH
via

,
gestation
and
lactation
and
continuation
of
exposure
of
the
F
(

)
from
weaning
until
killed
.

Immune
assessments
were
performed
at
postnatal
days
(
PNDs
)
21
,
42
and
70
.

Keyhole
limpet
hemocyanin
(
KLH
)
-specific
immune
responses
were
evaluated
following
subcutaneous
immunizations
on
PNDs
21
and
35
.

EtOH
exposure
affected
innate
as
well
as
adaptive
immune
responses
.

The
most
sensitive
immune
parameters
included
white
blood
cell
subpopulations
,
ConA-stimulated
splenocyte
proliferation
,
LPS-induced
NO
and
TNF-α
production
by
adherent
splenocytes
and
KLH-specific
immune
responses
.

Most
parameters
showed
recovery
after
cessation
of
EtOH
exposure
after
weaning
in
the
14
%
exposure
group
.

However
,
effects
on
LPS-induced
NO
and
TNF-α
production
by
adherent
splenocytes
and
KLH-specific
parameters
persisted
until
PND
70
.

The
results
demonstrate
the
relative
sensitivity
to
EtOH
of
especially
functional
immune
parameters
and
confirm
the
added
value
of
immune
parameters
in
the
EOGRTS
.

Furthermore
,
this
study
identified
an
expanded
KLH-specific
parameter
set
and
LPS-induced
NO
and
TNF-α
production
by
adherent
splenocytes
as
valuable
parameters
that
can
provide
additional
information
on
functional
immune
effects

In

Current

Anti-carcinogenic

We

in
jejunum

of
rats
fed
diets

In

organs
,
GPx1
mRNA
expression
was
70
%

90

lower
in

in

GPx2
expression
increased
in

the

was
4-5

for
both
sulfasalazine
and

.

The
acetylated

was
ineffective

The
present

suggest
that
inhibition

be
an

action
of

The

,
simultaneously
inactivates
the
pregnene

well
as
the
C21

activities
in

At

concentrations
(

ratios

,
the

inactivates
the

activity
(
t1

.
5-3
.
7
min
)
2-fold
faster
than
the
isomerase
activity
.

Pregnenolone
and
dehydroepiandrosterone
protect
the

activity
,
while
5-pregnene-3
,
20-dione
,
progesterone
,
and
androstenedione
protect
isomerase
activity
from
inactivation
.

The
protection
studies
and
competitive
kinetics
of
inhibition
demonstrate
that
the
affinity
alkylator
is
active
site-directed
.

Kitz
and
Wilson
analyses
show
that
2
alpha-bromoacetoxyprogesterone
inactivates
the

activity
by
a
bimolecular
mechanism
(
k3'

,
while
the

(

.

Pregnenolone
completely
protects
the
dehydrogenase
activity
but
does
not
slow
the
rate
of
isomerase
inactivation
by
2
alpha-bromoacetoxyprogesterone
at
all
.

NADH
completely
protects
both
activities
from
inactivation
by
the
alkylator
,
while
NAD
+
protects
neither
.

From
Dixon
analysis
,
NADH
competitively
inhibits
NAD
+
reduction
by
dehydrogenase
activity
.

Mixed
cofactor
studies
show
that
isomerase
binds
NAD
+
and
NADH
at
a
common
site
.

Therefore
,
NADH
must
not
protect
either
activity
by
simply
binding
at
the
cofactor
site
.

We
postulate
that
NADH
binding
as
an
allosteric
activator
of
isomerase
protects
both
the
dehydrogenase
and
isomerase
activities
from
affinity
alkylation
by
inducing
a
conformational
change
in
the
enzyme
protein
.

The
human
placental
enzyme
appears
to
express
the
pregnene

site

the

In

the

did
not

Surprisingly
,
despite
the

the

whey

were
unaffected

as
compared
with

That
mineralocorticoid
receptor
(
MR
)
might
compensate
for
the
loss
of
GR
was
suggested
by
the
detection
of
MR
in
the
mammary

This
hypothesis
was
tested
using
explant

fludrocortisone
was
able
to
synergistically
induce
beta-casein

These

suggest
that

may
compensate
for
the

GR
at
some

not

Obesity-induced
chronic
low-grade
inflammation
originates
from
adipose
tissue
and
is
crucial
for
obesity-driven
metabolic
deterioration
including
insulin
resistance
and
type
2
diabetes
.

Chronic
inflammation
may
be
a
consequence
of
a
failure
to
actively
resolve
inflammation
,
and
could
result
from
a
lack
of
local
specialized
pro-resolving
lipid
mediators
(
SPM
)
such
as
resolvins
and
protectins
,
which
derive
from
the
n-3
polyunsaturated
fatty
acids
eicosapentaenoic
acid
(
EPA
)
and
docosahexaenoic
acid
(
DHA
)
.

We
assessed
obesity-induced
changes
of
n-3-derived
SPM
in
adipose
tissue
and
effects
of
dietary
EPA
/
DHA
thereon
.

Moreover
,
we
treated
obese
mice
with
SPM
precursors
and
investigated
effects
on
inflammation
and
metabolic
dysregulation
.

Obesity
significantly
decreased
DHA-derived
17-hydroxydocosahexaenoic
acid
(
17-HDHA
,
resolvin
D1
precursor
)
and
protectin
D1
levels
in
murine
adipose
tissue
.

Dietary
EPA
/
DHA
treatment
restored
endogenous
biosynthesis
of
n-3
derived
lipid
mediators
in
obesity
while
attenuating
adipose
tissue
inflammation
and
improving
insulin
sensitivity
.

Notably
,
17-HDHA
treatment
reduced
adipose
tissue
expression
of
inflammatory
cytokines
,
increased
adiponectin
expression
and
improved
glucose
tolerance
parallel
to
insulin
sensitivity
in
obese
mice
.

These
findings
indicate
that
impaired
biosynthesis
of
certain
SPM
and
SPM
precursors
including
17-HDHA
and
protectin
D1
contributes
to
adipose
tissue
inflammation
in
obesity
and
suggest
17-HDHA
as
a
novel
treatment
option
for
obesity-associated
complications

Profenofos
is
a

(
OP
)
pesticide
capable
of
inhibiting
β-esterases
such
as
acetylcholinesterase
,
butyrylcholinesterase
,
and

.

Profenofos
is
known
to
be
detoxified
to
the
biologically
inactive
metabolite
,
4-bromo-2-chlorophenol
(
BCP
)
;
however
,
limited
data
are
available
regarding
the
use
of
urinary
BCP
as
an
exposure
biomarker
in
humans
.

A
pilot
study
conducted
in
Egyptian
agriculture
workers
,
demonstrated
that
urinary
BCP
levels
prior
to
application
(
3

)
were
elevated
to
34
.
5-3566μg
/
g
creatinine
during
the
time
workers
were
applying
profenofos
to
cotton
fields
.

Subsequently
,
the
in

enzymatic
formation
of
BCP
was
examined
using
pooled
human
liver
microsomes
and
recombinant
human
cytochrome
P-450s
(
CYPs
)
incubated
with
profenofos
.

Of
the
nine
human
CYPs
studied
,
only
CYPs
3A4
,
2B6
,
and
2C19
were
able
to
metabolize
profenofos
to
BCP
.

Kinetic
studies
indicated
that
CYP
2C19
has
the
lowest
Km
,
0

516μM
followed
by
2B6
(
Km
=

.
02μM
)
and
3A4
(

)
.

,
indicate
that

are
primarily
responsible
for
the
detoxification
of
profenofos
.

These
findings
support
the
use
of
urinary
BCP
as
a
biomarker
of
exposure
to
profenofos
in
humans
and
suggest
polymorphisms
in

The
formation
of
the
atherosclerotic
lesion
is
a
complex
process
influenced
by
an
array
of
inflammatory
and
lipid
metabolism
pathways
.

We
previously
demonstrated
that
NR4A
nuclear
receptors
are
highly
induced
in
macrophages
in
response
to
inflammatory
stimuli
and
modulate
the
expression
of
genes
linked
to
inflammation
in
vitro
.

Here
we
used
mouse
genetic
models
to
assess
the
impact
of
NR4A
expression
on
atherosclerosis
development
and
macrophage
polarization
.

led
to
comparable

of
atherosclerotic

after

.

We
also
observed
comparable
induction
of
genes
linked
to
M1
and
M2
responses
in
wild-type
and
Nur77-null
macrophages
in
response
to
lipopolysaccharides

,
respectively
.

In

Recent
studies
have
suggested
that
alterations
in
levels
of
Ly6C
(
lo
)
monocytes
may
be
a
contributor
to
inflammation
and
atherosclerosis
.

In
our
study
,
loss
of
Nur77
,
but
not
Nor1
,
was
associated
with
decreased
abundance
of
Ly6C
(

)
monocytes
,
but
this
change
was
not
correlated
with
atherosclerotic
lesion
development
.

Collectively
,
our
results
suggest
that
alterations
in
the
Ly6C

monocyte
population
and

NR4A

do
not
play
dominant
roles

We
report
,
for
the
first
time
,
the
immunotoxic
effects
of
DCPA
metabolites
on
T-cell
function
.

Human
Jurkat
T
cells
were
exposed
to
varying
concentrations
of
DCPA
or
its
metabolites
and
assayed
for
effects
on
T-cell
function
.

In
addition
,
fluorine
analogs
of
DCPA
and
DCA
were
investigated
to
determine
the
relative
role
of
chlorine
substituents
on
T-cell
immunotoxicity
.

Here
we
report
that
exposure
of
Jurkat
T
cells
to
DCPA
and
DCA
alters
IL-2
secretion
,
nuclear
factor
of
activated
T
cells
(
NFAT
)
activity
,
and
calcium
influx

However
,
exposure
to
6OH-DCA
and
NOH-DCA
reduces
IL-2
secretion
and
NFAT
activity
but
has
no
effect
on
calcium
flux
.

When
both
chlorines
in
DCPA
and
DCA
were
substituted
with
fluorines
all
effects
were
abrogated
.

Our

indicate
that

The
natural
product
tryptanthrin
(

)
represents
a
potential
lead
for
new
tuberculosis
(
TB
)
drugs
since
tryptanthrin
and
its
synthetic
analogues
possess
potent
in
vitro
activity
against
Mycobacterium
tuberculosis
(
Mtb
)
.

However
,
in
spite
of
their
in
vitro
activity
,
none
of
these
agents
have
been
shown
to
be
efficacious
in

against
animal
models
of
TB
.

Described
herein
are
syntheses
of
new
tryptanthrin
analogues
together
with
a
systematic
investigation
of
their
in

antitubercular
activity
and
ADME
properties
followed
by

characterization
in

for
the
most
promising
compounds
.

Those
with
the
best
potency
and
oral
bioavailability
were
progressed
to
evaluations
of
efficacy
against
acute
murine
TB
.

The
work
aimed
to
prove
the
concept
that
this
compound
class
can
limit
growth
of
Mtb
during
infection
as
well
as
to
establish
the
SAR
for
in

activity
against
Mtb
and
the
range
of
in

ADME
parameters
for
this
class
of
natural
products
.

Novel
C-11-deoxy
(
5b
)
and
A-ring-saturated
(
6
)
tryptanthrin
analogues
were
discovered
that
maintained
activity
against
Mtb
and
showed
improved
solubility
compared
to
tryptanthrin
as
well
as
evidence
of
oral
bioavailability
in
rodents
.

However
,
neither
5b

efficacy
against
acute
murine
TB
following
administration
at
doses
up
to
400

Although
5b

failed
to
inhibit

,
they
illuminate
a
path
to

and
the

,
a

.

METHODS
:
Asthma
model
was
induced
by
chronic
exposure
to
ovalbumin
(
OVA
)
in
C57BL
/
6
mice
.

The
eosinophils
in
bronchoalveolar

(
BAL
)
fluid
and
lung
tissues
were
counted
,
IL-5
level
in
BAL
fluid
was
measured
,
and
CysLT1
and
CysLT2
receptor

were
detected
by
semi-quantitative
RT-PCR
.

RESULTS
:
Montelukast
(
6
mg

,
once
per
day
for
20
d
)
significantly
suppressed
the
increased
eosinophils
in
BAL
fluid
and
lung
tissue
,
and
increased
IL-5
level
in
BAL
fluid
in
OVA
challenged
mice
.

OVA
challenge
increased
CysLT1
but
decreased
CysLT2
receptor
mRNA
expression
.

Montelukast
inhibited
the
increased
CysLT1
but
not
the
reduced
CysLT2
expression
after
OVA
challenge
.

CONCLUSION
:
CysLT
receptors
are
modulated
immunologically
,
and
montelukast
inhibits
up-regulation
of
CysLT1
receptor
and

to
induce

to
both
U-NX

to
protect

It
is
concluded
that
the
pretreatment
of
NDGA
is
able
to
induce
in

nuclear
Nrf2

in

of

A
novel
,
EGFR-targeted
nanomedicine
has
been
developed
in
the
current
study
.

Glutaraldehyde
crosslinked
albumin
nanoparticles
with
a
size
of
approximately
100nm
were
loaded
with
the
multikinase
inhibitor
17864-L
(
x
)
-a
platinum-bound
sunitinib
analogue-which
couples
the
drug
to
methionine
residues
of
albumin
and
is
released
in
a
reductive
environment
.

Albumin
nanoparticles
were
surface-coated
with
bifunctional
polyethylene
glycol
3500
(
PEG
)
and
a
nanobody-the
single
variable
domain
of
an
antibody-
(
Ega1
)
against
the
epidermal
growth
factor
receptor
(
EGFR
)
.

EGa1-PEG
functionalized
nanoparticles
showed
a
40-fold
higher
binding
to
EGFR-positive
14C
squamous
head
and
neck
cancer
cells
in
comparison
to
PEGylated
nanoparticles
.

17864-L
(
x
)
loaded
EGa1-PEG
nanoparticles
were
internalized
by
clathrin-mediated
endocytosis
and
ultimately
digested
in
lysosomes
.

The
intracellular
routing
of
EGa1
targeted
nanoparticles
leads
to
a
successful
release
of
the
kinase
inhibitor
in
the
cell
and
inhibition
of
proliferation
whereas
the
non-targeted
formulations
had
no
antiproliferative
effects
on
14C
cells
.

The
drug
loaded
targeted
nanoparticles
were
as
effective
as
the
free
drug
in
vitro
.

These
results
demonstrate
that
multikinase
inhibitor
loaded
nanoparticles
are
interesting
nanomedicines
for
the
treatment
of
EGFR-positive
cancers
.
This
study
tested
the
time
course
of
the
discriminative
stimulus
effects
of
inhibitors
of
monoamine
oxidase
alone
or
in
combination
with
cocaine
.

Male
Sprague-Dawley
rats
were
trained
to
discriminate
cocaine
(
10
mg
/
kg
,
intraperitoneal
)
from
saline
using
a
two-lever
choice
methodology
.

The
nonselective
monoamine
oxidase
inhibitors
tranylcypromine
(
0
.
01-5
mg
/
kg
)
and
phenelzine
(
1-25
mg
/
kg
)
,
the
monoamine
oxidase-A
selective
compound
clorgyline
(
1-25
mg
/
kg
)
,
and
the
monoamine
oxidase-B
selective
compounds
pargyline
(
0
.
005-50
mg
/
kg
)
and
selegiline
(
1-25
mg
/
kg
)
were
tested
for
substitution
15
min
or
24
h
following
administration
,
and
in
combination
with
10
mg
/
kg
of
cocaine
24
and
48
h
after
administration
.

At
15
min
,
selegiline
fully
substituted
for
the
discriminative
stimulus
effects
of
cocaine
,
whereas
all
other
compounds
partially
substituted
.

At
24
h
,
substitution
of
cocaine
was
diminished
for
all
compounds
except
phenelzine
,
which
produced
a
greater
amount
of
substitution
at
24
h
than
at
15
min
.

When
cocaine
was
administered
24
h
after
clorgyline
,
selegiline
,
pargyline
,
and
phenelzine
,
cocaine-appropriate
responding
was
attenuated
at
intermediate
doses
of
these
drugs
,
whereas
the
highest
doses
did
not
alter
cocaine-lever
responding
.

All
compounds
except
selegiline
substantially
decreased
response
rate
and
produced
various
adverse
effects
.

At
48
h
,
the
effects
of
all
compounds
except
phenelzine
were
markedly
reduced
.

Selectivity
for
monoamine
oxidase-A
or
monoamine
oxidase-B
did
not
predict
the
ability
to
substitute
for
or
attenuate
the
subjective
effects
of
cocaine
.

These
findings
suggest
that
monoamine
oxidase
inhibitors
can
modulate
the
discriminative
stimulus
effects
of
cocaine
for
at
least
24
h
,
and
may
be
useful
for
treatment
of
cocaine
abuse
.
Induction
of

protects
cells
from
oxidative
injury
.

Here
Hsp72
,
Hsp27
and
heme
oxygenase-1
(
HO-1
)
were
induced
in
cultured
rat
astrocytes
,
and
protection
against
oxidative
stress
was
investigated
.

Astrocytes
were
treated
with
sodium
arsenite
(
20-50
micro
m
)
for
1
h
,
which
was
non-toxic
to
cells
,
24
h
later
they
were
exposed
to
400
micro
m
H2O2
for
1
h
,
and
cell
death
was
evaluated
at
different
time
points
.

Arsenite
triggered
strong
induction
of
HSPs
,
which
was
prevented
by
1
micro
g
/
mL
cycloheximide
(
CXH
)
.

H2O2
caused
cell
loss
and
increased
cell
death
with
features
of
apoptosis
,
i
.

e
.

TdT-mediated
dUTP
nick-end
labelling
(
TUNEL
)
reaction
and
caspase-3
activation
.

These
features
were
abrogated
by
pre-treatment
with
arsenite
,
which
prevented
cell
loss
and
significantly
reduced
the
number
of
dead
cells
.

The
protective
effect
of
arsenite
was
not
detected
in
the
presence
of
CHX
.

Pre-treatment
with
arsenite
increased
protein
kinase
B
(
Akt
)
and
extracellular
signal
regulated
kinase
1
/
2
(
ERK1
/
2
)
phosphorylation
after
H2O2
.

However
,
while
Akt
phosphorylation
was
prevented
by
CHX
,
Erk1
/
2
phosphorylation
was
further
enhanced
by
CHX
.

The
results
show
that
transient
arsenite
pre-treatment
induces
Hsp72
,
HO-1
and
,
to
a
lesser
extent
,
Hsp27;
it
reduces
H2O2-induced
astrocyte
death;
and
it
causes
selective
activation
of
Akt
following
H2O2
.

It
is
suggested
that
HSP
expression
at
the
time
of
H2O2
exposure
protects
astrocytes
from
oxidative
injury
and
apoptotic
cell
death
by
means
of
pro-survival
Akt
.

Perinatal
glucocorticoid
(
GC
)
treatment
is
increasingly
associated
with
long-term
disturbances
in
hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical
function
.

In
the
male
rat
,
such
treatment
induces
profound
molecular
,
morphological
and
functional
changes
in
the
anterior
pituitary
gland
at
adulthood
.

To
determine
whether
these
effects
are
sex-specific
,
we
have
examined
the
effects
of
perinatal
dexamethasone
treatment
on
the
female
pituitary
gland
,
focusing
on
(
i
)
the
integrity
of
the
annexin
1
(
ANXA1
)
dependent
regulatory
effects
of
GCs
on
adrenocorticotrophic
hormone
(
ACTH
)
release
and
(
ii
)
corticotroph
and
folliculo-stellate
(
FS
)
cell
morphology
.

Dexamethasone
was
given
to
pregnant
(
gestational
days
16-19
)
or
lactating
(
days
1-7
post
partum
)
rats
via
the
drinking
water
(
1
microg
/
ml
)
;
controls
received
normal
drinking
water
.

Pituitary
tissue
from
the
female
offspring
was
examined
ex
vivo
at
adulthood
(
60-90
days
)
.

Both
treatment
regimes
reduced
the
intracellular
and
cell
surface
ANXA1
expression
,
as
determined
by
western
blot
analysis
and
quantitative
immunogold
electron
microscopic
histochemistry
.

In
addition
,
they
compromised
the
ability
of
dexamethasone
to
suppress
the
evoked
release
of
ACTH
from
the
excised
tissue
in
vitro
,
a
process
which
requires
the
translocation
of
ANXA1
from
the
cytoplasm
to
the
cell
surface
of
FS
cells
.

Although
neither
treatment
regime
affected
the
number
of
FS
cells
or
corticotrophs
,
both
altered
the
subcellular
morphology
of
these
cells
.

Thus
,
prenatal
dexamethasone
treatment
increased
while
neonatal
treatment
decreased
FS
cell
size
and
cytoplasmic
area
.

By
contrast
,
corticotroph
size
was
unaffected
by
either
treatment
,
as
also
was
the
size
of
the
secretory
granules
.

Corticotroph
granule
density
and
margination
were
,
however
,
increased
markedly
by
the
prenatal
treatment
,
while
the
neonatal
treatment
had
no
effect
on
granule
density
but
decreased
granule
margination
.

Thus
,
perinatal
dexamethasone
treatment
exerts
long-term
effects
on
the
female
pituitary
gland
,
altering
gene
expression
,
cell
morphology
and
the
ANXA1-dependent
GC
regulation
of
ACTH
secretion
.

The
changes
are
similar
but
not
identical
to
those
reported
in
the
male
.

Novel
therapeutic
strategies
for
type
2
diabetes
are
needed
,
since
the
current
treatment
options
neither
address
all
pathophysiological
mechanisms
nor
achieve
the
glycemic
target
goals
.

A
general
islet-cell
dysfunction
including
insulin-
and
glucagon-secretion
defects
contributes
to
the
pathophysiology
of
type
2
diabetes
.

Improving
islet
function
by
incretin
hormone
action
is
a
novel
therapeutic
approach
.

Glucagon-like
peptide-1
(
GLP-1
)
and
glucose-dependent
insulinotropic
peptide
(
GIP
)
are
important
incretin
hormones
contributing
to
50-70%
of
the
stimulation
of
insulin
secretion
after
a
meal
.

Dipeptidyl-peptidase
IV
(
DPP-4
)
inhibitors
inhibit
the
degradation
of
GLP-1
and
GIP
as
well
as
that
of
other
regulatory
peptides
.

Sitagliptin
,
a
DPP-4
inhibitor
,
is
orally
active
and
has
been
shown
to
be
efficacious
and
safe
in
clinical
studies
.

Sitagliptin
has
received
approval
in
Mexico
,
the
United
States
and
other
countries
.

Like
other
DPP-4
inhibitors
,
sitagliptin
reduces
hemoglobin
A1c
(
HbA1c
)
,
fasting
and
postprandial
glucose
by
glucose-dependent
stimulation
of
insulin
secretion
and
inhibition
of
glucagon
secretion
.

Sitagliptin
is
weight
neutral
.

Indirect
measures
show
a
possible
improvement
of
beta-cell
function
.

Sitagliptin
does
not
cause
a
higher
rate
of
hypoglycemia
in
comparison
to
metformin
or
placebo
.

This
article
gives
an
overview
of
the
mechanisms

,

and
clinical
trial
results
of
sitagliptin
.
Maspin
is
a
member
of
the
serine
protease
inhibitor
(
serpin
)
superfamily
and
displays
tumor-suppressing
activity
by
controlling
cell
migration
,
proliferation
,
apoptosis
,
and
adhesion
.

Here
,
we
provide
evidence
that
maspin
acts
as
a
reactive
oxygen
species
(
ROS
)
scavenger
through
oxidation
of
three
structurally
exposed
cysteine
thiols
to
sulfenic
acid
.

Ablation
of
these
cysteine
residues
in
maspin
resulted
in
a
significant
increase
in
total
ROS
production
in
mouse
mammary
TM40D
cells
.

Also
,
cells
containing
a
triple-cysteine
mutant
of
maspin
showed
elevated
ERK1
/
2
activity
,
a
downstream
target
of
ROS
,
and
enhanced
proliferation
and
colony
formation
.

These
findings
establish
a
novel
mechanism
by
which
maspin
utilizes
its
cysteine
thiols
to
inhibit
oxidative
stress
and
cell
growth
.
In
this
study
we
explore
the
mechanisms
by
which
a
double
mutation
(
E59D
/
D75Y
)
in
cardiac
troponin
C
(
CTnC
)
associated
with
dilated
cardiomyopathy
reduces
the
Ca
(
2
+
)
-activated
maximal
tension
of
cardiac
muscle
.

Studying
the
single
mutants
(
i
.

e
.

E59D
or
D75Y
)
indicates
that
D75Y
,
but
not
E59D
,
causes
a
reduction
in
the
calcium
affinity
of
CTnC
in
troponin
complex
,
regulated
thin
filaments
(
RTF
)
,
and
the
Ca
(
2
+
)
sensitivity
of
contraction
and
ATPase
in
cardiac
muscle
preparations
.

However
,
both
D75Y
and
E59D
are
required
to
reduce
the
actomyosin
ATPase
activity
and
maximal
force
in
muscle
fibers
,
indicating
that
E59D
enhances
the
effects
of
D75Y
.

Part
of
the
reduction
in
force
/
ATPase
may
be
due
to
a
defect
in
the
interactions
between
CTnC
and
cardiac
troponin
T
,
which
are
known
to
be
necessary
for
ATPase
activation
.

An
additional
mechanism
for
the
reduction
in
force
/
ATPase
comes
from
measurements
of
the
binding
stoichiometry
of
myosin
subfragment-1
(
S-1
)
to
the
RTF
.

Using
wild
type
RTFs
,
4
.
8
mol
S-1
was
bound
per
mol
filament
(
seven
actins
)
,
whereas
with
E59D
/
D75Y
RTFs
,
the
number
of
binding
sites
was
reduced
by
approximately
23%
to
3
.
7
.

Altogether
,
these
results
suggest
that
the
reduction
in
force
and
ATPase
activation
is
possibly
due
to
a
thin
filament
conformation
that
promotes
fewer
accessible
S-1-binding
sites
.

In
the
absence
of
any
family
segregation
data
,
the
functional
results
presented
here
support
the
concept
that
this
is
likely
a
dilated
cardiomyopathy-causing
mutation
.
The
voltage
gated
calcium
channel
family
is
a
major
target
for
a
range
of
therapeutic
drugs
.

Mibefradil
(
Ro
40-5967
)
belongs
to
a
new
chemical
class
of
these
molecules
which
differs
from
other
Ca2
+
antagonists
by
its
ability
to
potently
block
T-type
Ca2
+
channels
.

However
,
this
molecule
has
also
been
shown
to
inhibit
other
Ca2
+
channel
subtypes
.

To
further
analyze
the
mechanism
governing
the
Ca2
+
channel-Mibefradil
interaction
,
we
examined
the
effect
of
Mibefradil
on
various
recombinant
Ca2
+
channels
expressed
in
mammalian
cells
from
their
cloned
cDNAs
,
using
Ca2
+
as
the
permeant
ion
at
physiological
concentration
.

Expression
of
alpha1A
,
alpha1C
,
and
alpha1E
in
tsA
201
cells
resulted
in
Ca2
+
currents
with
functional
characteristics
closely
related
to
those
of
their
native
counterparts
.

Mibefradil
blocked
alpha1A
and
alpha1E
with
a
Kd
comparable
to
that
reported
for
T-type
channels
,
but
had
a
lower
affinity
(
approximately
30-fold
)
for
alpha1C
.

For
each
channel
,
inhibition
by
Mibefradil
was
consistent
with
high-affinity
binding
to
the
inactivated
state
.

Modulation
of
the
voltage-dependent
inactivation
properties
by
the
nature
of
the
coexpressed
beta
subunit
or
the
alpha1
splice
variant
altered
block
at
the
Mibefradil
receptor
site
.

Therefore
,
we
conclude
that
the
tissue
and
sub-cellular
localization
of
calcium
channel
subunits
as
well
as
their
specific
associations
are
essential
parameters
to
understand
the
in
vivo
effects
of
Mibefradil
.
Steroidogenesis
in
the
unfertilized

ova
was
investigated
by
indirect
immunofluorescence
study
.

delta
5-3
beta-Hydroxysteroid

activity
was
found
in
hamster
follicular

ovulatory
ova
with
pregnenolone
used
as

substrate
.

A
significant
quantity
of
17
beta-estradiol
was
detected
in
the
ooplasm
of
follicular

ovulatory
ova
.

No
progesterone
was
found
.

The
activity
of
delta
5-3
beta-HSD
in
follicular
and
ovulatory
ova
was
inhibited
by
preincubation
with
10
IU
of
human
chorionic
gonadotropin
(
hCG
)
in
1
ml
of
phosphate
buffer
solution
.

Trilostane
,
a
potent
new
inhibitor
of
the
delta
5-3
beta-HSD
system
,
was
found
to
inhibit
the
activity
of
delta
5-3
beta-HSD
in
ovulatory
ova
in
1
ml
of
phosphate
buffer
solution
at
a
concentration
of

.

After
these
results
were
obtained
,
steroidogenesis
of
hamster
ova
was
suggested
in
an
indirect
immunofluorescence
study
,
and
the
implications
of
steroidogenesis
for

maturation
and
subsequent

are

.
BACKGROUND
:
The
efficacy
of
ACE-inhibitor
therapy
is
well
documented
in
the
treatment
of
chronic
heart
failure
.

As
pharmacological
mechanisms
of
ACE-inhibition
and
angiotensin
II
AT1-receptor-antagonists
differ
,
an
additional
positive
effect
concerning
left
ventricular
function
can
be
expected
in
combining
both
classes
of
drugs
.

METHODS
:
Twenty
patients
(
64
.
9
+
/
-8
.
5
years
)
with
advanced
chronic
heart
failure
(
NYHA
class
III
)
receiving
long-term
medication
with
digitalis
,
diuretics
and
ACE-inhibitors
were
randomized
to
either
eprosartan
(
540
+
/
-96
mg
/
day
)
or
placebo
,
according
to
a
blinded
protocol
.

Hemodynamic
measurements
by
impedance
cardiography
were
performed
at
baseline
and
after
8
.
85
+
/
-1
.

5
days
of
study
medication
treatment
.

RESULTS
:
Additional
treatment
with
eprosartan
resulted
in
a
higher
cardiac
output
than
in
the
control
group
(
P<0
.
05
)
.

While
in
the
active
treatment
group
cardiac
output
increased
significantly
from
baseline
(
2
.
27-3
.
24
l
/
min
,
P
=

)
,
there
was
no
change
in
the
control
group
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
The
additional
treatment
with
the
AT1-receptor
antagonist
eprosartan
,
given
to
severe
heart
failure
patients
,
who
received
digitalis
,
diuretics
and
ACE-inhibitors
,
resulted
in
a
beneficial
effect
by
increasing
cardiac
output
.

This
effect
may
be
due
to
eprosartan's
additional
property
of
blocking
the
autocrine
interaction
of
locally
and
not
ACE-generated
angiotensin
II
with
their
respective
vascular
and
myocardial
AT1-receptors
as
well
as
the
influence
on
prejunctional
AT1-receptors
located
on
sympathetic
nerve
terminals
.
Short-chain
fatty
acids
are
an
important
source
of
energy
for
colonocytes
.

One
of
these
is
propionate
,
which
is
metabolized
through
carboxylation
by
propionyl-CoA
carboxylase
(
PCC
)
,
an
enzyme
encoded
by
2
genes
,
PCCA
and
PCCB
.

The
co-factor
of
this
reaction
is
biotin
,
a
product
of
intestinal
bacterial
metabolism
,
as
is
propionate
.

Despite
detailed
knowledge
about
the
metabolic
effects
and
physiology
of
biotin
,
the
relative
amounts
of
this
vitamin
in
normal
colonic
mucosae
and
in
tumour
tissue
remains
quite
unknown
.

The
biotin
content
in
normal
and
cancerous
cells
from
the
distal
digestive
tract
was
examined
on
10
pairs
of
tissue
specimens
of
colorectal
cancer
and
adjacent
normal
mucosae
using
reflectance
in
situ
hybridization
(
RISH
)
.

Having
observed
a
high
biotin
content
in
colon
mucosae
and
a
low
content
in
colorectal-cancer
cells
,
we
then
studied
the
transcription
levels
of
PCCA
and
PCCB
genes
in
9
colorectal
cancers
and
the
corresponding
mucosae
.

In
all
cases
,
the
levels
of
mRNA
were
lower
in
colorectal
cancers
than
in
normal
mucosae
,
the
decrease
being
always
more
marked
for
PCCB
than
for
PCCA
.

In
normal
mucosae
and
in
adenocarcinoma
cancer
cells
,
PCCA
and
PCCB
transcription
levels
were
strongly
related
to
the
amount
of
biotin
detected
,
but
not
to
the
number
of
chromosomes
13
(
which
carries
PCCA
)
or
3
(
which
carries
PCCB
)
.
Chronic
obstructive
pulmonary
disease
(
COPD
)
is
a
major
cause
of
morbidity
and
mortality
worldwide
.

Oxidative
stress
is
an
important
mechanism
in
the
pathogenesis
of
this
disease
.

The
oxidant
/
antioxidant
imbalance
occurring
in
smokers
and
patients
with
COPD
is
well
established
.

Thus
,
therapeutic
strategies
targeting
oxidative
stress
with
pharmacological
antioxidant
agents
or
boosting
the
endogenous
levels
of
antioxidants
is
likely
to
be
beneficial
as
an
adjunctive
tool
in
the
treatment
of
COPD
patients
.

Thiol
compounts
such
as
N-acetyl-L-cysteine
(
NAC
)
,
carbocysteine
,
erdosteine
,
and
fudosteine
have
been
extensively
studied
.

Although
some
results
remain
controversial
,
NAC
and
carbocysteine
seem
to
have
beneficial
effect
in
patients
not
receiving
inhaled
corticosteroids
who
suffer
from
frequent
exacerbations
.

In
addition
,
other
antioxidants
like
superoxide
dismutase
(
SOD
)
mimetics
and
nuclear
factor-erythroid
2
related
factor
2
(
Nrf2
)
are
shown
to
decrease
markers
of
oxidative
stress
in
patients
with
emphysema
,
while
others
like
glutathione
peroxidase
(
GPx
)
mimetics
and
NO
synthase
(
iNOS
)
can
prevent
both
inflammation
and
oxidative
stress
in
clinical
trials
in
vivo
(
or
in
mouse
models
)
.

In
this
article
we
review
the
effectiveness
of
various
antioxidant
factors
in
COPD
and
their
potential
beneficial
effect
in
the
treatment
of
the

In
the
postabsorptive
state
,
certain
tissues
,
including
the
brain
,
require
glucose
as
the
sole
source
of
energy
.

After
an
overnight
fast
,
hepatic
glycogen
stores
are
depleted
,
and
gluconeogenesis
becomes
essential
for
preventing
life-threatening
hypoglycemia
.

Mice
with
a
targeted
deletion
of
KLF15
,
a
member
of
the
Kruppel-like
family
of
transcription
factors
,
display
severe
hypoglycemia
after
an
overnight
(
18
hr
)
fast
.

We
provide
evidence
that
defective
amino
acid
catabolism
promotes
the
development
of
fasting
hypoglycemia
in
KLF15-
/
-
mice
by
limiting
gluconeogenic
substrate
availability
.

KLF15-
/
-
liver
and
skeletal
muscle
show
markedly
reduced
mRNA
expression
of
amino
acid-degrading
enzymes
.

Furthermore
,
the
enzymatic
activity
of
alanine
aminotransferase
(
ALT
)
,
which
converts
the
critical
gluconeogenic
amino
acid
alanine
into
pyruvate
,
is
decreased
(
approximately
50%
)
in
KLF15-
/
-
hepatocytes
.

Consistent
with
this
observation
,
intraperitoneal
injection
of
pyruvate
,
but
not
alanine
,
rescues
fasting
hypoglycemia
in
KLF15-
/
-
mice
.

We
conclude
that
KLF15
plays
an
important
role
in
the
regulation
of
gluconeogenesis

3-Phosphoglycerate
dehydrogenase
(
Phgdh
)
is
the
initial
step
enzyme
in
the
phosphorylated
pathway
of
L-serine
biosynthesis
.

We
have
previously
revealed
in
the
brain
that
Phgdh
is
preferentially
expressed
in
glial
cells
,
but
not
in
neurons
,
and
that
glia-borne
L-serine
exerts
strong
neurotrophic
actions
to
neuronal
survive
,
differentiation
,
and
development
.

To
investigate
whether
such
an
L-serine-meditated
intercellular
relationship
is
constructed
in
peripheral
organs
and
tissues
,
we
examined
the
kidney
,
which
is
one
of
the
organs
with
the
highest
expression
of
Phgdh
mRNA
in
the
body
.

We
found
that
Phgdh
was
distributed
highly
in
the
renal
papilla
and
inner
layer
of
the
outer
zone
and
moderately
in
the
cortex
,
whereas
it
was
almost
negative
in
the
outer
layer
of
the
outer
zone
.

This
heterogeneous
distribution
was
due
to
selective
expression
in

tubular
segments

Therefore
,
either
Phgdh

is
provided
to
each

,
suggesting
that
metabolic

Differential

Data
from
the
literature
indicate
that
nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory
drugs
(
NSAIDs
)
,
such
as
indomethacin
,
naproxen
,
piroxicam
,
or
ibuprofen
,
induce
hair
loss
in
vivo
.

These
NSAIDs
are
well-known
inhibitors
of
both
the
cytoprotective
isoform
of
prostaglandin
endoperoxide
synthase-1
(
PGHS-1
)
and
of
the
inducible
form
(
PGHS-2
)
.

By
immunohistochemical
staining
,
we
found
that
PGHS-1
is
the
main
isoform
present
in
the
dermal
papilla
from
normal
human
hair
follicle
(
either
anagen
or
catagen
)
,
whereas
PGHS-2
was
only
faintly
and
exclusively
expressed
in
anagen
dermal
papilla
.

Thus
,
PGHS-1
might
be
the
primary
target
of
the
hair
growth-inhibitory
effects
of
NSAIDs
.

We
thus
speculated
that
activation
of
PGHS-1
might
be
a
mechanism
by
which
minoxidil
(
2
,
4-diamino-6-piperidinopyrimidine-3-oxyde
)
stimulates
hair
growth
in
vivo
.

We
demonstrate
here
that
minoxidil
is
a
potent
activator
of
purified
PGHS-1
(
AC50
=
80
microM
)
,
as
assayed
by
oxygen
consumption
and
PGE2
production
.

This
activation
was
also
evidenced
by
increased
PGE2
production
by
BALB
/
c
3T3
fibroblasts
and
by
human
dermal
papilla
fibroblasts
in
culture
.

Our
findings
suggest
that
minoxidil
and
its
derivatives
may
have
a
cytoprotective
activity
in
vivo
and
that
more
potent
second-generation
hair
growth-promoting
drugs
might
be
designed

Cocaine
modulates

levels

rats
,
as
well
as
in

and
progesterone
decreases
or
attenuates
cocaine-induced
behavioral
and

.

It
has
been
postulated
that
cocaine's
modulation
of
serum
progesterone
levels
may
in
turn
alter
progesterone
receptor
activity
,
thereby
contributing
to
cocaine-induced
alterations
of
neuronal

regulations

To
test
this
hypothesis
,
intact

received

.

After
injection
of
15
mg

induction
of
progesterone
serum
levels
was
closely
followed
by
an
increase

.

After

of
30

similar
effects

observed
along
with
an
attenuation

Our

exploration

potential
mechanisms

toxicity

drug
fenclozic
acid

Fluorescence
and
stopped
flow
methods
were
used
to
compare
clinically
used
heparins
with
regard
to
their
ability
to
bind
to
antithrombin
and
to
accelerate
the
inactivation
of
factor
Xa
.

Titration
of
antithrombin
with
both
low
molecular
weight
heparin
(
LMWH
)
(
enoxaparin
,
fragmin
and
ardeparin
)
and
unfractionated
heparin
(
UFH
)
produced
an
equivalent
fluorescence
increase
and
indicates
similar
affinity
of
all
heparin
preparations
to
antithrombin
.

However
,
relative
to
UFH
enoxaparin
,
the
LMWH
with
the
smallest
average
molecular
mass
,
contained
only
12%
material
with
high
affinity
for
antithrombin
.

The
rate
of
factor
Xa
inhibition
by
antithrombin
increased
with
the
concentration
of
the
examined
heparins
to
the
same
limiting
value
,
but
the
concentration
required
for
maximal
acceleration
depended
on
the
preparation
.

According
to
these
data
the
high
affinity
fraction
of
the
heparin
preparations
increased
the
intrinsic
fluorescence
and
inhibitory
activity
equally
without
additional
effects
by
variations
in
chain
length
and
chemical
composition
.

In
contrast
,
in
the
presence
of
Ca
UFH
accelerated
the
inhibition
of
factor
Xa
by
antithrombin
10-fold
more
efficiently
than
comparable
concentrations
of
the
high
affinity
fractions
of
enoxaparin
and
fragmin
.

The
bell-shaped
dependence
of
this
accelerating
effect
suggests
simultaneous
binding
of
both
proteins
to
heparin
.

In
conclusion
,
under
physiologic
conditions
the
anti-factor
Xa
activity
of
heparin
results
from
a
composite
effect
of
chain
length
and
the
content
of
material
with
high
affinity
to
antithrombin
.

Thus
,
the
reduced
antithrombotic
activity
of
LMWH
relative
to
UFH
results
from
a
smaller
content
of
high
affinity
material
and
the
absence
of
a
stimulating
effect
of
calcium

OBJECTIVES
:
In
this
paper
we
investigated
the
effect
of
indomethacin
,
acetazolamide
and
their
combination
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
on
carbonic
anhydrase
(
CA
)
isozymes
.

METHOD
:
In
vitro
experiments
followed
the
effect
of
the
two
substances
at
concentrations
between
10
(
-8
)
-10
(
-4
)
M
on
purified
human
red

CA
I
and
II
as
well
as
on
human
gastric
mucosa
CA
IV
using
dose-response
relationships
.

Kinetic
studies
were
also
performed
.

The
effects
of
single
and
combined
administration
of
indomethacin
and
acetazolamide
on
red
cell
CA
and
on
gastric
acid
secretion
were
studied
in
vivo
.

RESULTS
:
Indomethacin
,
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
.

induces
an
increase
in
erythorcyte
CA
I
and
CA
II
activity
.

Acetazolamide
,
a
specific
inhibitor
of
CA
,
reduces
the
activity
of
CA
I
and
CA
II
from
red
cells
.

Indomethacin
completely
antagonizes
CA
activity
,
i
.

e
.

abolishes
the
inhibitory
effect
of
acetazolamide
on
CA
.

In
humans
,
an
increase
or
decrease
in
erythrocyte
CA
II
activity
is
correlated
with
an
increase
or
decrease
in
gastric
acid
secretion
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
Our
results
show
that
indomethacin
,
a
known
cyclooxygenase
(
COX
)
inhibitor
,
is
also
an
activator
of
CA
.

Our
data
also
prove
that
indomethacin
is
not
only
an
activator
of
CA
but
also
antagonizes
the
effect
of
acetazolamide
,
a
specific
inhibitor
of
this
enzyme
.

In
view
of
the
role
of
CA
in
acid-base
balance
as
well
as
the
fact
that
an
increase
or
decrease
in
its
activity
is
accompanied
by
an
increase
or
decrease
in
intra-
and
extracellular
pH
,
our
results
suggest
that
:
firstly
,
CA
activation
induced
by
indomethacin
might
cause
changes
in
COX
activity;
secondly
,
PGs
are
synthetized
as
a
consequence
of
the
changes
in
COX
activity
,
a
hypothesis
that
requires
further
study

It
is
postulated
that
SHMT

is
associated
with

and
the

is
regulated
by

The
aim
of
this
study
is
to
advance
our
understanding
of
the
folate-mediated
one-carbon
metabolism
in
zebrafish
by
characterizing
zebrafish
mitochondrial
SHMT
.

The
cDNA
encoding
zebrafish
mitochondrial
SHMT
was
cloned
,
overexpressed
in
Escherichia
coli
,
and
purified
with
a
three-step
purification
protocol
.

Similarities
in
structural
,
physical
,
and
kinetic
properties
were
revealed
between
the
recombinant
zebrafish
mitochondrial
SHMT
and
its
mammalian
orthologs
.

Surprisingly
,
leucovorin
significantly
inhibits
the
aldol
cleavage
of
serine
catalyzed
by
zebrafish
cytosolic
SHMT
but
inhibits
to
a
lesser
extent
the
reaction
catalyzed
by
the
mitochondrial
isozyme
.

This
is
,
to
our
knowledge
,
the
first
report
on
zebrafish
mitochondrial
folate
enzyme
as
well
as
the
differential
inhibition
of
leucovorin
on
these
two
SHMT
isoforms
.

Western
blot
analysis
revealed
tissue-specific
distribution
with
the
highest
enrichment
present
in
liver
for
both
cytosolic
and
mitochondrial
SHMTs
.

Intracellular
localization
was
confirmed
by
confocal
microscopy
for
both
mitochondrial
and
cytosolic
SHMTs
.

Unexpectedly
,
the
cytosolic
isoform
was
observed
in
both
nucleus
and
cytosol
.

Together
with
the
previous
report
on
zebrafish
cytosolic
SHMT
,
we
suggest
that
zSHMTs
can
be
used
in
in

assays
for
folate-related
investigation
and

To

we
probed
the

,
which
attenuated
the

,
alleviating
clinical
hallmarks
of
chronic

as

This

attenuated

Polymeric
nanoparticles
have
revealed
very
effective
in
transmucosal
delivery
of
proteins
.

Polysaccharides
are
among
the
most
used
materials
for
the
production
of
these
carriers
,
owing
to
their
structural
flexibility
and
propensity
to
evidence
biocompatibility
and
biodegradability
.

In
parallel
,
there
is
a
preference
for
the
use
of
mild
methods
for
their
production
,
in
order
to
prevent
protein
degradation
,
ensure
lower
costs
and
easier
procedures
that
enable
scaling
up
.

In
this
work
we
propose
the
production
of
pullulan-based
nanoparticles
by
a
mild
method
of
polyelectrolyte
complexation
.

As
pullulan
is
a
neutral
polysaccharide
,
sulfated
and
aminated
derivatives
of
the
polymer
were
synthesized
to
provide
pullulan
with
a
charge
.

These
derivatives
were
then
complexed
with
chitosan
and
carrageenan
,
respectively
,
to
produce
the
nanocarriers
.

Positively
charged
nanoparticles
of
180-270nm
were
obtained
,
evidencing
ability
to
associate
bovine
serum
albumin
,
which
was
selected
as
model
protein
.

In
PBS
pH
7

4
,
pullulan-based
nanoparticles
were
found
to
have
a
burst
release
of
30%
of
the
protein
,
which
maintained
up
to
24h
.

Nanoparticle

and
zeta

were
preserved
upon
freeze-drying
in

A

design
was
approached
to

Aldehyde
oxidase
(
AOX
)
metabolizes
many
xenobiotics
in
vitro
,
but
its
importance
in
vivo
is
usually
unknown
relative
to
cytochrome
P450s
(
CYPs
)
and
other
detoxification
systems
.

Currently
,
the
most
important
insecticides
are
neonicotinoids
,
which
are
metabolized
in
vitro
by
AOX
on
reduction
of
the
nitroimino
group
and
by
CYPs
via
oxidation
reactions
.

The
goal
of
this
study
was
to
establish
the
relative
importance
of
AOX
and
CYPs
in
vivo
using
the
mouse
model
.

The
procedure
was
to
reduce
liver
AOX
activity
by
providing
tungsten
or
hydralazine
in
the
drinking
water
or
to
use
the
AOX-deficient
DBA
/
2
mouse
strain
.

None
of
these
approaches
reduced
CYP
activity
measured
in
vitro
with
an
isozyme
nonspecific
substrate
.

Liver
AOX
activity
was
reduced
by
45%
with
tungsten
and
61%
with
hydralazine
and
81%
in
AOX-deficient
mice
relative
to
controls
.

When
mice
were
treated
ip
with
the
major
neonicotinoid
imidacloprid
(
IMI
)
,
metabolism
by
CYP
oxidation
reactions
was
not
appreciably
affected
,
whereas
the
AOX-generated
nitrosoguanidine
metabolite
was
decreased
by
30%
with
tungsten
and
56%
with
hydralazine
and
86%
in
the
AOX-deficient
mice
.

The
other
IMI
nitroreduction
metabolite
,
desnitro-IMI
,
was
decreased
by
55%
,
65%
,
and
81%
with
tungsten
,
hydralazine
,
and
in
the
AOX-deficient
mice
,
respectively
.

Thus
,
decreasing
liver
AOX
activity
by
three
quite
different
procedures
gave
a
corresponding
decrease
for
in
vivo
reductive
metabolites
in
the
liver
of
IMI-treated
mice
.

Possible
AOX
involvement
in
IMI
metabolism
in
insects
was
evaluated
using
AOX-expressing
and
AOX-deficient
Drosophila
,
but
no
differences
were
found
in
IMI
nitroreduction
or
sensitivity
between
the
two
strains
.

This
is
the
first
study
to
establish
the
in

relevance
of
AOX
in
neonicotinoid
metabolism

BACKGROUND
:
Pranlukast
,
a
cysteinyl
leukotriene
receptor
1
(
CysLTR1
)
antagonist
,
inhibits
not
only
airway
smooth
muscle
contraction
,
but
also
allergic
inflammation
.

The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
determine
the
mechanism
of
pranlukast-induced
interleukin-5
(
IL-5
)
inhibition
in
allergic
inflammation
.

METHODS
:
Surgically
resected
human
lung
tissue
was
passively
sensitized
in
vitro
with
mite-allergen-sensitized
sera
,
followed
by
stimulation
with
mite
allergen
after
pretreatment
of
the
tissue
with
pranlukast
,
dexamethasone
,
or
both
.

The
IL-5
protein
level
in
the
culture
medium
was
measured
,
and
in
situ
hybridization
of
IL-5
and
CysLTR1
mRNA
was
performed
using
lung
tissues
.

RESULTS
:
Pretreatment
of
lung
tissues
with
pranlukast
alone
significantly
decreased
the
amount
of
IL-5
protein
in
the
culture
medium
by
40%
.

The
combination
of
pranlukast
and
dexamethasone
synergistically
enhanced
this
effect
.

Quantitative
in
situ
hybridization
with
image
analysis
revealed
abundant
expression
of
IL-5
mRNA
in
eosinophils
,
lymphocytes
,
and
mast
cells
in
sensitized
and
allergen-stimulated
lung
tissues
.

CysLTR1
mRNA
was
detected
in
macrophages
,
smooth
muscle
cells
,
eosinophils
,
and
mast
cells
,
but
was
less
expressed
in
lymphocytes
.

Pranlukast-induced
inhibition
of
IL-5
mRNA
expression
was
noted
in
various
cells
,
irrespective
of
their
CysLTR1
mRNA
expression
status
.

In
addition
,
cysteinyl
leukotrienes
per
se
failed
to
upregulate
the
IL-5
production
.

CONCLUSION
:
Our
results
indicate
that
pranlukast
inhibits
IL-5
synthesis
via
a
mechanism
distinct
from
CysLTR1
antagonism
.
Methamphetamine
induces
monoamine
depletions
thought
to
contribute
to
cognitive
and
behavioral
dysfunctions
.

Previously
,
we
reported
that
methamphetamine-induced
neurotoxicity
is
associated
with
impaired
formation
of
stimulus-response
associations
.

Additionally
,
subjective
observations
suggested
that
behavioral
flexibility
might
be
affected
.

Thus
,
the
present
study
examined
whether
methamphetamine
neurotoxicity
induces
perseverative
behavior
.

Rats
were
pretreated
with
(
±
)
-methamphetamine
(
4
×
10
mg
/
kg
,
2-hr
intervals
)
or
saline
.

Three
weeks
later
,
rats
were
trained
to
press
a
lever
on
one
side
of
an
operant
chamber
and
then
retrieve
the
reinforcer
from
a
magazine
on
the
opposite
side
until
they
reached
criterion
(
>50
reinforcers
/
30-min
)
.

After
four
consecutive
sessions
performing
the
task
at
criterion
,
rats
were
sacrificed
and
brains
removed
for
monoamine
determinations
.

Methamphetamine-pretreated
rats
had
∼50%
loss
of
striatal
dopamine
and
prefrontal
serotonin
.

Methamphetamine-
and
saline-pretreated
rats
were
not
different
in
the
number
of
sessions
required
to
reach
criterion
or
in
the
total
numbers
of
lever
presses
and
/
or
head
entries
made
across
the
four
consecutive
sessions
at
criterion-level
performance
.

However
,
methamphetamine-pretreated
rats
earned
fewer
reinforcers
,
because
they
made
extra
lever-presses
and
head
entries
when
they
should
have
been
retrieving
the
reinforcer
or
returning
to
the
lever
.

Latencies
for
methamphetamine-pretreated
rats
to
switch
between
the
two
behaviors
also
were
significantly
slower
than
latencies
for
controls
.

Interestingly
,
the
degree
of
additional
lever-presses
negatively
correlated
with
serotonin-transporter
binding
in
the
prefrontal
cortex
,
even
in
saline-pretreated
controls
.

These
data
suggest
that
methamphetamine-induced
partial
monoamine
toxicity
is
associated
with
perseveration
and
that
the
degree
of
perseveration
may
depend
on
serotonin
innervation
of
the
frontal
cortex
.

GATA2
transcription
factor
and
LIM
homeodomain
proteins
Islet1
(
ISL1
)
and
LIM
homeobox
3
(
LHX3
)
are
suspected
to
be
involved
in
gonadotrope
cell
fate
and
maintenance
.

The
GnRH
receptor
gene
(
Gnrhr
)
,
crucial
for
gonadotrope
function
,
is
expressed
in
the
pituitary
gland
from
embryonic
day
13
.
5
onward
,
well
before
LH
and
FSH
β-subunits
.

This
expression
pattern
together
with
the
presence
of
WGATAR
and
TAAT
motifs
in
Gnrhr
promoter
sequences
suggests
the
involvement
of
early
transcription
factors
in
promoter
activation
.

In
this
study
,
using
a
well-characterized
transgenic
mouse
model
,
GATA2
was
found
colocalized
with
Gnrhr
promoter
activity
in
the
pituitary
.

Transient
transfection
of
Gnrhr
promoter
luciferase
fusion
constructs
together
with
either
GATA2
expression
vectors
or
small
interfering
RNA
in
gonadotrope
cell
lines
indicated
that
GATA2
,
which
typically
acts
as
a
trans-activator
,
unexpectedly
repressed
Gnrhr
promoter
activity
.

Using
DNA
chromatography
affinity
and
EMSA
,
we
demonstrated
that
GATA2
operates
via
a
response
element
containing
a
peculiar
palindromic
GATA
motif
that
overlaps
a
critical
TAAT
motif
involved
in
LHX3
/
ISL1
trans-activation
.

Indeed
,
despite
the
inhibitory
action
of
GATA2
,
this
element
displayed
a
clear-cut
enhancer
activity
in
gonadotrope
cells
.

Chromatin
immunoprecipitation
assays
indicated
that
GATA2
,
LHX3
,
and
ISL1
interact
with
a
Gnrhr
promoter
fragment
encompassing
this
element
.

The
trans-repressive
action
of
GATA2
on
Gnrhr
promoter
activity
is
likely
balanced
or
even
hindered
by
trans-activating
effects
of
LIM
homeodomain
proteins
via
this
novel
bifunctional
LIM
/
GATA
response
element
.

Such
a
hierarchical
interplay
may
contribute
to
finely
adjust
Gnrhr
gene
expression
in
gonadotrope
cell
lineage
during
pituitary
development
as
well
as
in
the
adult
animal
.
Asenapine

agent
with
a
unique
human
receptor
signature
.
Although
Cyclooxygenase-2
(
COX-2
)
is
essential
for
mouse
ovulation
,
fertilization
,
implantation
and
decidualization
,
the
regulation
and
function
of
COX-2
in
rat
reproduction
are
still
unknown
.

This
study
was
designed
to
examine
the
action
of
COX-2
in
rat
ovulation
,
implantation
and
decidualization
by
using
two
specific
inhibitors
of
COX-2
(
nimesulide
and
niflumic
acid
)
.

Compared
to
control
,
either
nimesulide
or
niflumic
acid
significantly
inhibited
the
ovulation
in
the
superovulated
rats
.

Although
nimesulide
had
no
obvious
effects
on
the
number
of
implantation
sites
and
the
vascular
permeability
,
the
expression
of
PPARdelta
,
HB-EGF
and
vimentin
proteins
was
down-regulated
in
the
nimesulide-treated
groups
.

COX-1
protein
was
upregulated
by
nimesulide
treatment
.

Nimesulide
also
had
an
inhibitory
effect
on
decidualization
during
early
pregnancy
and
under
artificial
decidualization
.

Moreover
,
nimesulide
caused
the
increase
of
the
gestation
period
and
the
reduction
of
litter
size
and
birth
weight
compared
to
controls
.

Based
on
our
data
,
rat
implantation
and
decidualization
were
delayed
by
nimesulide
treatment
,
resulting
in
the
reduction
of
litter
size
and
birth
weight
and
the
prolongation
of
gestational
length
,
suggesting
that
COX-2
plays
an
important
role
in
implantation
and
decidualization
.

Testing
chemicals
for
their
endocrine-disrupting
potential
,
including
interference
with
estrogen
receptor
(
ER
)
signaling
,
is
an
important
aspect
of
chemical
safety
testing
.

Because
of
the
practical
drawbacks
of
animal
testing
,
the
development
of
in
vitro
alternatives
for
the
uterotrophic
assay
and
other
in
vivo
(
anti
)
estrogenicity
tests
has
high
priority
.

It
was
previously
demonstrated
that
an
in
vitro
assay
that
profiles
ligand-induced
binding
of
ERα
to
a
microarray
of
coregulator-derived
peptides
might
be
a
valuable
candidate
for
a
panel
of
in
vitro
assays
aiming
at
an
ultimate
replacement
of
the
uterotrophic
assay
.

In
the
present
study
,
the
reproducibility
and
robustness
of
this
coregulator
binding
assay
was
determined
by
measuring
the
binding
profiles
of
14
model
compounds
that
are
recommended
by
the
Office
of
Prevention
,
Pesticides
and
Toxic
Substances
for
testing
laboratory
proficiency
in
estrogen
receptor
transactivation
assays
.

With
a
median
coefficient
of
variation
of
5
.
0%
and
excellent
correlation
(
R
(
2
)
=
0
.
993
)
between
duplicate
measurements
,
the
reproducibility
of
the
ERα-coregulator
binding
assay
was
better
than
the
reproducibility
of
other
commonly
used
in
vitro
ER
functional
assays
.

In
addition
,
the
coregulator
binding
assay
is
correctly
predicting
the
estrogenicity
for
13
out
of
14
compounds
tested
.

When
the
potency
of
the
ER-agonists
to
induce
ERα-coregulator
binding
was
compared
to
their
ER
binding
affinity
,
their
ranking
was
similar
,
and
the
correlation
between
the
EC50
values
was
excellent
(
R
(
2
)
=
0
.
96
)
,
as
was
the
correlation
with
their
potency
in
a
transactivation
assay
(
R
(
2
)
=
0
.
94
)
.

Moreover
,
when
the
ERα-coregulator
binding
profiles
were
hierarchically
clustered
using
Euclidian
cluster
distance
,
the
structurally
related
compounds
were
found
to
cluster
together
,
whereas
the
steroid
test
compounds
having
an
aromatic
A-ring
were
separated
from
those
with
a
cyclohexene
A-ring
.

We
concluded
that
this
assay
is
capable
of
distinguishing
ERα
agonists
and
antagonists
and
that
it
even
reflects
the
structural
similarity
of
ERα
agonists
,
indicating
a
potential
to
achieve
identification
and
classification
of
ERα
endocrine
disruptors
with
high
fidelity

Different

Management
of
fungal
infections
is
markedly
limited
by
problems
of
drug
safety
,
resistance
and
effectiveness
profile
.

Current
therapy
for
invasive
mycoses
uses
a
relatively
reduced
number
of
antifungal
drugs
,
such
as
amphotericin
B
,
fluconazole
and
itraconazole
.

Other
new
antifungal
agents
from
old
and
new
chemical
families
,
like
voriconazole
,
posaconazole
,
ravuconazole
,
caspofungin
and
micafungin
,
have
been
introduced
into
the
armamentarium
for
fungal
infections
management
.

This
review
is
focused
on
the
mode
of
action
of
those
antifungal
drugs
used
against
pathogenic
yeasts
.

The
interaction
of
amphotericin
B
with
ergosterol
and
other
membrane
sterols
results
in
the
production
of
aqueous
pores
of
drug
and
the
ergosterol
biosynthetic
pathway
is
the
target
of
the
allylamines
,
phenylmorpholines
and
azole
antifungal
agents
.

The
main
molecular
target
of
azole
antifungals
is
the
cytochrome
P-450
protein
Erg11p
/
Cyp51p
.

Echinocandins
,
a
new
class
of
antifungal
drugs
,
are
fungal
secondary
metabolites
that
act
against
beta-1-3-D-glucan
synthesis
.

The
phenylmorpholines
,
of
which
amorolfine
is
the
sole
representative
in
human
therapy
,
affect
two
targets
in
the
ergosterol
pathway
:
Erg24p
(
delta
14
reductase
)
and
Erg2p
(
delta
8-delta

)
.

The
sordarins
group
are
protein
synthesis
inhibitors
that
work

are
zofimarin
,
BE31045
,
SCH57504
,
xylarin
,
hypoxysordarin
and
GR135402
.

In
order
to
overcome
the
problems
derived
from
the
exploitation
of
azole
drugs
,
macrolides
and
echinocandins
,
novel
targets
were
explored
.

Proposed
antifungal
drugs
have
been
developed
against
potential
targets
like
the
N-myristylation
of
fungal
proteins
,
with
inhibitors
like
myristate
and
histidine

or

derivatives
,

While
the
benefits
of
progestogen
use
in
hormone
replacement
therapy
(
HRT
)
are
well
recognized
as
far
as
endometrial
protection
is
concerned
,
their
risks
and
drawbacks
have
generated
controversial
articles
.

Several
risks
are
attributed
to
progestogens
as
a
class-effect;
however
,
the
progestogens
used
in
HRT
have
varying
pharmacological
properties
and
do
not
induce
the
same
side
effects
.

Natural
progesterone
(
P
)
and
some
of
its
derivatives
,
such
as
the
19-norprogesterones
(
Nestorone
,
nomegestrol
acetate
,
trimegestone
)
,
do
not
bind
to
the
androgen
receptor
and
,
hence
,
do
not
exert
androgenic
side
effects
.

Newly
synthesized
molecules
such
as
drospirenone
or
dienogest
have
no
androgenic
effect
but
do
have
a
partial
antiandrogenic
effect
.

Drospirenone
derives
from
spironolactone
and
binds
to
the
mineralocorticoid
receptor
.

When
the
cardiovascular
risk
factors
are
considered
,
some
molecules
with
a
higher
androgenic
potency
than
others
attenuate
the
beneficial
effects
of
estrogens
on
the
lipid
profile
as
well
as
the
vasomotion
.

On
the
other
hand
,
other
progestogens
devoid
of
androgenic
properties
do
not
exert
these
deleterious
effects
.

The
epidemiological
data
do
not
suggest
any
negative
effect
of
the
progestogens
administered
together
with
estrogens
on
cardiovascular
morbidity
or
mortality
.

However
,
recent
results
suggest
that
in
women
with
established
coronary
heart
disease
,
HRT
may
not
protect
against
further
heart
attacks
when
the
progestogen
selected
possesses
androgenic
properties
.

The
data
related
to
the
progestogen
effect
on
breast
tissue
has
been
interpreted
differently
from
country
to
country
.

However
,
it
has
been
admitted
that
,
according
to
the
type
of
progestogen
used
and
the
dose
and
duration
of
its
application
,
a
predominant
antiproliferative
effect
is
observed
in
the
human
breast
cells
.

As
far
as
breast
cancer
risk
is
concerned
,
most
epidemiological
studies
do
not
suggest
any
significant
difference
between
the
estrogens
given
alone
or
combined
with
progestogens
in
HRT
.

Complying
with
the
classic
contraindications
of
HRT
and
selecting
molecules
devoid
of
estrogenic
,
androgenic
,
or
glucocorticoid
effect
should
allow
a
larger
use
of
the
progestins
without
any
major
drawback
.
Unraveling
the
mechanisms
involved
in
castration-
and
therapy-resistant
prostate
cancer
has
led
to
a
renewed
interest
in
androgen
receptor
(
AR
)
-targeted
therapeutics
.

Anti-androgens
that
block
the
activity
of
the
AR
therefore
remain
a
valid
therapeutic
option
.

However
,
they
must
be
more
effective
than
,
or
display
a
distinct
mechanism
of
action
or
binding
mode
from
those
of
bicalutamide
and
hydroxyflutamide
,
which
are
currently
in
clinical
use
.

For
that
reason
,
the
second-generation
anti-androgen
MDV3100
was
developed
.

MDV3100
,
however
,
shares
its
4-cyano-3-
(
trifluoromethyl
)
phenyl
group
with
bicalutamide
and
hydroxyflutamide
required
for
binding
to
the
AR
.

In
this
work
,
we
used
a
combined
strategy
to
find
new
antagonist
structures
distinct
from
the
4-cyano-3-
(
trifluoromethyl
)
phenyl
group
to
avoid
cross-resistance
for
these
compounds
and
to
find
structures
without
agonist
activity
on
mutant
ARs
(
AR
W741C
and
AR
T877A
)
.

We
found
two
novel
chemotypes
with
AR-antagonistic
activity
(
IC
(
50
)
:
3-6
μM
)
by
virtual
screening
and
confirmed
their
biological
activity
in
an
androgen-responsive
reporter
assay
.

The
design
of
our
computational
approach
was
validated
by
the
observation
of
strongly
decreased
or
absence
of
agonistic
activity
on
the
two
mutant
ARs
.

Further
structural
derivatization
to
optimize
the
potency
of
these
compounds
can
render
these
chemotypes
into
very
promising
,
alternative
AR
antagonists
for
prostate
cancer
therapy

Mutations

underlie

known
as
thiamine-responsive
megaloblastic
anemia
(
TRMA
)
characterized
by
anemia
,
diabetes
,
and
sensorineural

loss
.

To
create
a
mouse
model
of
this
disease
,
a
mutant
line
was
created
with
targeted
disruption
of
the
gene
.

Cochlear
function
is
normal
in
these
mutants
when
maintained
on
a
high-thiamine
diet
.

When
challenged
with
a
low-thiamine
diet
,
Slc19a2-null
mice
showed
40-60
dB
threshold
elevations
by
auditory
brainstem
response
(
ABR
)
,
but
only
10-20
dB
elevation
by
otoacoustic
emission
(
OAE
)
measures
.

Wild-type
mice
retain
normal
hearing
on
either
diet
.

Cochlear
histological
analysis
showed
a
pattern
uncommon
for
sensorineural
hearing
loss
:
selective
loss
of
inner
hair
cells
after
1-2
weeks
on
low
thiamine
and
significantly
greater
inner
than
outer
hair
cell
loss
after
longer
low-thiamine
challenges
.

Such
a
pattern
is
consistent
with
the
observed
discrepancy
between
ABR
and
OAE
threshold
shifts
.

The
possible
role
of
thiamine
transport
in
other
reported
cases

However
,

interaction

Mutations
C569Y
and
V608F
in
the
NADPH
binding
domain
of
POR
had
49
and
28%
of
activity
of
CYP19A1
compared
with
normal
reductase
and
were
more
sensitive
to
the
amount
of
NADPH
available
for
supporting
CYP19A1
activity
.

Substitution
of
NADH
for
NADPH
had
a
higher
impact
on
C569Y
and
V608F
mutants
of
POR
.

Similar
effects
were
obtained
at
low
/
high

)
pH
,
but
using
octanol
to
limit
the
flux
of
electrons
from
POR
to
CYP19A1
inhibited
activity
supported
by
all
variants
.

High
molar
ratios
of
KCl
also
reduced
the
CYP19A1
supporting
activities
of
C569Y
and
V608F
mutants
of
POR
to
a
greater
extent
compared
to

Because
POR
supports
many
P450s

in
steroidogenesis
,
bone
formation
,
and
drug
metabolism
,
variations
in
the
effects
of

may
explain

The
etiology
of
preeclampsia
is
unknown
but
is
thought
to
be
related
to
hypoxia
in
the
placenta
.

We
previously
reported
that
the
enzyme
lactate
dehydrogenase
(
LDH
)
has
increased
activity
and
gene
expression
in
placentas
from

.

LDH
is
responsible
for
pyruvate
conversion
to
lactate
through
glycolysis
.

In
this
study
,
we
further
investigated
the
role
of
hypoxia
in
primary
trophoblast
cells
and
a
cultured
cell
line
,
JEG3
cells
,
to
obtain
a
better
understanding
of
how
it
affects
the
activities
of
lactate
dehydrogenase
,
lactate
production
and
regulatory
genes
,
as
a
possible
model
for
preeclampsia
.

Primary
trophoblast
cells
and
JEG3
cells
were
cultured
under
1%
oxygen
.

At
6
,
12
and
24h
,
cells
were
analyzed
for
LDHA
and
LDHB
isozyme
activities
,
mRNA
and
protein
expression
compared
to
standard
culture
conditions
.

Lactate
was
measured
from
cell
medium
.

The
hypoxia
inducible
transcription
factor
(
HIF-1alpha
)
protein
expression
was
confirmed
by
western
blot
.

Two
lactate
transporters
(
MCT1
and
MCT4
)
mRNA
and
protein
expression
were
also
studied
under
hypoxia
.

Finally
,
lactate
was
measured
in
plasma
obtained
from
patients
with
severe
preeclampsia
.

Under
hypoxic
conditions
,
LDHA
mRNA
is
increased
in
primary
trophoblast
cells
and
JEG3
cells
.

The
HIF-1alpha
protein
expression
is
higher
in
hypoxia-treated
JEG3
cells
than
control
.

LDHA
isozyme
activity
and
its
protein
expression
are
increased
most
significantly
at
24h
of
culture
under
hypoxia
.

However
,
LDHB
protein
is
unchanged
while
its
mRNA
is
decreased
.

Lactate
secretion
from
JEG3
cells
under
hypoxia
is
increased
,
as
is
the
lactate
levels
in
the
plasma
from
preeclampsia
patients
.

Of
the
two
lactate
transporters
studied
,
MCT4
mRNA
and
protein
level
are
increased
under
hypoxia
.

Our
findings
support
the
role
of
hypoxia
in
inducing
HIF-1alpha
activity
in
trophoblasts
and
increasing
LDH
transcription
as
well
as
its
activity
.

Higher
levels
of
lactate
are
produced
and
secreted
which
may
contribute
to
the
higher
lactate
levels
in
plasma
of
preeclamptic
patients
.

These
mechanisms
may
be
important
in
the
pathophysiology
of
preeclampsia
.
The
extra-pyramidal
symptoms
associated
with
manganism
often
overlap
with
that
seen
in
Parkinsonism
suggesting
a
common
link
between
the
two
disorders
.

Since
wide
deviations
are
observed
in
susceptibility
and
characteristics
of
the
symptoms
observed
in
manganism
,
these
differences
may
be
due
to
underlying
genetic
variability
.

Genes
linked
to
early
onset
of
Parkinsonism
which
includes
ATP13A2
and
parkin
have
already
been
suggested
to
promote
development
of
Mn
toxicity
.

Of
the
other
Parkinson-linked
genes
,
mutations
in
LRRK2
,
an
autosomal
dominant
gene
,
represent
another
likely
candidate
involved
in
the
development
of
manganism
.

In
this
paper
the
effect
of
shRNA
LRRK2
knock-down
on
Mn
toxicity
was
examined
in
control
and
DAT
transfected
HEK293
cells
.

Results
demonstrate
that
LRRK2
down-regulation
potentiates
Mn
toxicity
in
both
control
and
DAT-transfected
cell
as
well
as
potentiates
DA
toxicity
.

Combined
treatment
of
Mn
and
DA
further
augments
cell
toxicity
,
ROS
production
and
JNK
phosphorylation
in
LRRK2
deficient
cells
compared
to
controls
.

Consistent
with
studies
demonstrating
that
LRRK2
plays
a
role
in
the
phosphorylation
of
p38
,
our
results
similarly
demonstrate
a
decrease
in
p38
activation
in
LRRK2
knock-down
cells
.

Our
findings
suggest
that
null
mutations
in
LRRK2
which
cause
Parkinsonism
potentiate
Mn
toxicity
and
increase
susceptibility
to
develop
manganism

We

reported
potassium-chloride
cotransporter

The
purpose
of
the
present
study
was
to
demonstrate
in
these
cells
as
well
as
in
human
lens

the
potassium-chloride
cotransport
(
KCC
)
isoforms
by
reverse

reaction
(

)
,
Western

Of
the
four
KCC
genes
known
to
encode
the
respective
proteins
and
their
spliced
variants
,
RT-PCR
with
both
rat
and

primers
revealed
the
predicted
cDNA
fragments
of
KCC1

KCC3a
,
KCC3b
,
and
KCC4
but
not
KCC2
in

Polyclonal

and
anti-human
(

antibodies
against
rtKCC1
and
hmKCC3
,
respectively
,
and
a
commercially
available
rb-anti-mouse

KCC4
antibody
were
used
.

Rb
anti-rtKCC1-ECL3
[
against
epitopes

the
large

)
]
revealed
a
150kDa
band
in
HLE-B3
cells
consistent
with
the
known
molecular
weight
of
KCC1
.

Rb
anti-hmKCC3-ECL3
yielded
three
bands
of
150
,
122
and
105kDa
,
evidence
for
the
presence
of
KCC3a
,
KCC3b
and
possibly
KCC3c
isoforms
.

The
122
and
112kDa
bands
were
also
demonstrated
by
rb
anti-hmKCC3-CTD
[
the
C-terminal
domain
(
CTD
)
]
.

Rb
anti-msKCC4
antibody
only
showed
a
100kDa
band
in
HLE-B3
cells
.

In
the
human
lens
tissues
,
a
115kDa
protein
was
detected
with
rb
anti-rtKCC1-ECL3
and
a
100kDa
band
with
rb
anti-msKCC4
,
however
,
no
bands
with

-KCC4
antibodies
and
a
Cy3-tagged

.

Hence
HLE-B3
cells
expressed
proteins
of
the
KCC1
,
KCC3a
,
b
,
and
KCC4
isoforms
,
whereas
surgically

In
a
view
to
develop
new
DNA
alkylating
antitumour
drugs
,
evaluating
the
precise
mechanism
of
action
and
the
molecular
/
cellular
consequences
of
the
alkylation
is
a
point
of
major
interest
.

The
benzo-b-acronycine
derivative
S23906-1
alkylates
guanine
nucleobases
in
the
minor
groove
of
the
DNA
helix
and
presents
an
original
ability
to
locally
open
the
double
helix
of
DNA
,
which
appears
to
be
associated
with
its
cytotoxic
activity
.

However
,
the
molecular
mechanism
linking
adduct
formation
to
cellular
consequences
is
not
precisely
known
.

The
objective
of
the
present
study
was
to
identify
proteins
involved
in
the
recognition
and
mechanism
of
action
of
S23906-DNA
adducts
.

We
found
that
GAPDH
(
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase
)
is
a
protein
that
binds
to
S23906-alkylated
single-stranded
,
double-stranded
and
telomeric
sequences
in
a
drug-dependent
and
DNA
sequence
/
structure-dependent
manner
.

We
used
the
CASTing
(
cyclic
amplification
of
sequence
targeting
)
method
to
identify
GAPDH
DNA-binding
selectivity
and
then
evaluated
its
binding
to
such
selected
S23906-alkylated
sequences
.

At
the
cellular
level
,
alkylation
of
S23906-1
results
in
an
increase
in
the
binding
of
GAPDH
and
its
protein
partner
HMG
(
high-mobility
group
)
B1
to
the
chromatin
.

Regarding
the
multiple
roles
of
GAPDH
in
apoptosis
and
DNA
repair
,
the
cytotoxic
and
apoptotic
activities
of
GAPDH
were
evaluated
and
present
opposite
effects
in
two
different
cellular
models

BACKGROUND
:
Prior
investigations
have
demonstrated
that
beta
(
2
)
-adrenoceptor
stimulation
is
ineffective
in
inhibiting
synthesis
of
eicosanoids
in
human
eosinophils
.

This
effect
has
been
postulated
to
relate
to
density
or
structural
differences
in
the
beta
(
2
)
-adrenoceptor
or
its
coupled
G-protein
.

However
,
recent
reports
indicate
that
cAMP-specific
PDE4
activity
in
eosinophils
is
10-fold
that
of
other
inflammatory
cells
.

We
postulated
that
selective
blockade
of
PDE4
in
eosinophils
would
unmask
the
inhibitory
effect
of
beta
(
2
)
-adrenoceptor
stimulation
and
that
this
inhibition
would
result
from
decreased
phosphor-ylation
of
cytosolic
group
IV-PLA
(
2
)
(
gIV-PLA
(
2
)
)
.

OBJECTIVE
:
To
determine
(
a
)
whether
PDE4
inhibition
alone
with
rolipram
blocked
secretions
of
arachidonic
acid
(
AA
)
and
leukotriene
C
(
4
)
(
LTC
(
4
)
)
caused
by
activation
of
eosinophils
with
formyl-met-leu-phe
plus
cytochalasin
B
(
FMLP
/
B
)
,
(
b
)
to
determine
if
PDE4
inhibition
plus
beta
(
2
)
-adrenoceptor
agonist
act
additively
to
augment
endogenous
cAMP
concentration
,
and
(
c
)
to
determine
the
mechanism
by
which
additive
inhibition
of
AA
and
LTC
(
4
)
synthesis
is
regulated
by
cAMP
.

METHODS
:
Human
eosinophils
were
pretreated
with
buffer
,
salmeterol
or
rolipram
(
singly
or
combination
)
before
FMLP
/
B
activation
.

Release
of
AA
and
LTC
(
4
)
,
intracellular
cAMP
concentration
,
and
phosphorylation
and
activation
of
gIV-PLA
(
2
)
were
determined
.

RESULTS
:
Rolipram
unmasked
the
inhibitory
effect
of
beta
(
2
)
-adrenoceptor
stimulation
with
salmeterol
and
significantly
attenuated
the
stimulated
release
of
AA
and
subsequent
LTC
(
4
)
.

Inhibition
corresponded
to
increased
cAMP
production
caused
by
rolipram
alone
or
rolipram
plus
salmeterol
and
blocked
proportionately
the
phosphorylation
and
activation
of
gIV-PLA
(
2
)
in
FMLP
/
B-activated
eosinophils
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
Inhibition
of
PDE4
by
rolipram
unmasks
beta
(
2
)
-adrenergic
blockade
of
LTC
(
4
)
synthesis
caused
by
FMLP
/

The
nuclear
receptor
peroxisome

(
PPAR
)
α
is
known
primarily
as
a
regulator
of
fatty
acid
metabolism
,
energy
balance
,
and
inflammation
,
but
evidence
suggests
a
wider
role
in
regulating
the
biotransformation
of
drugs
and
other
lipophilic
chemicals
.

We
investigated
whether
PPARα
directly
regulates
the
transcription
of
cytochrome
P450
3A4
,
the
major
human
drug-metabolizing
enzyme
.

Using
chromatin
immunoprecipitation
in
human
primary
hepatocytes
as
well
as
electrophoretic
mobility
shift
and
luciferase
reporter-gene
assays
,
we
identified
three
functional
PPARα-binding
regions
(
PBR-I
,
-II
,
and
-III
)
within
∼12
kb
of
the
CYP3A4
upstream
sequence
.

Furthermore
,
a
humanized
CYP3A4
/
3A7
mouse
model
showed
in
vivo
induction
of
CYP3A4
mRNA
and
protein
by
[
4-chloro-6-
(
2
,
3-xylidino
)
-2-pyrimidinylthio
]
acetic
acid
(
WY14
,
643
)
in
liver
but
not
in
intestine
,
whereas
hepatic
occupancy
of
PBRs
by
PPARα
was
ligand
independent
.

Using
lentiviral
gene
knock-down
and
treatment
with
WY14
,
643
in
primary
human
hepatocytes
,
PPARα
was
further
shown
to
affect
the
expression
of
a
distinct
set
of
CYPs
,
including
1A1
,
1A2
,
2B6
,
2C8
,
3A4
,
and
7A1
,
but
not
2C9
,
2C19
,
2D6
,
or
2E1
.

Interestingly
,
the
common
phospholipid
1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphocholine
(
16
:
0
/
18
:
1-PC
)
,
previously
proposed
to
reflect
nutritional
status
and
shown
to
be
a
specific
endogenous
ligand
of
PPARα
,
induced
CYP3A4
(
up
to
4-fold
)
and
other
biotransformation
genes
in
hepatocytes
with
similar
selectivity
and
potency
as
WY14
,
643
.

These
data
establish
PPARα
as
a
direct
transcriptional
regulator
of
hepatic
CYP3A4
.

This
finding
warrants
investigation
of
both
known
and
newly
developed
PPARα-targeted
drugs
for
their
drug-drug
interaction
potential
.

Furthermore
,
our
data
suggest
that
nutritional
status
can
influence
drug

OBJECTIVE
:
Preterm
birth
is
one
of
the
major
problems
faced
in
perinatal
medicine
and
is
often
associated
with
underlying
clinical
infection
.

Treatment
with
maternal
betamethasone
has
helped
to
improve
neonatal
morbidity
and
mortality
.

We
hypothesized
that
betamethasone
treatment
and
chorioamnionitis
would
alter
the
bioavailability
of
placental
glucocorticoids
through
the
regulation
of
the
11beta
hydroxysteroid
dehydrogenase
(
11beta
HSD
)
isozymes
and
the
glucocorticoid
receptor
(
GR
)
.

METHODS
:
Placental
samples
were
obtained
from
three
groups
of
women
who
delivered
prematurely
:
(
1
)
those
who
delivered
in
the
absence
of
infection
,
(
2
)
those
who
received
betamethasone
treatment
before
delivering
without
infection
,
and
(
3
)
those
who
had
pregnancies
complicated
with
chorioamnionitis
.

Western
blotting
was
used
to
determine
11beta
HSD-1
,
11beta
HSD-2
,
GRT
,
and
GRalpha
expression
,
and
11beta
HSD-2
activity
was
determined
in
each
group
.

JEG-3
cells
were
used
to
study
the
regulation
of
the
11beta
HSD
isozymes
.

RESULTS
:
In
cases
of
chorioamnionitis
where
mothers
had
not
been
treated
with
betamethasone
,
placental
32-kd
11beta
HSD-1
protein
expression
was
increased
.

In
cases
of
chorioamnionitis
regardless
of
betamethasone
treatment
,
placental
11beta
HSD-2
expression
and
activity
was
decreased
compared
to
controls
.

In
these
placental
samples
,
the
expression
of
GRT
and
GRalpha
did
not
change
significantly
.

In
JEG-3
cells
,
11beta
HSD-1
32-kd
expression
was
increased
with
interleukin
(
IL
)
-1beta
and
tumor
necrosis
factor
alpha
(
TNF-alpha
)
,
while
11beta
HSD-2
expression
was
unaffected
.

CONCLUSION
:
These
data
suggest
that
there
could
be
an
increased
fetal
exposure
to
maternal
glucocorticoids
in
cases
of
chorioamnionitis
as
a
result
of
changes
in
the
expression
and
activity
of
the
placental
11beta
HSD
isozymes
.

promoted

LC-MS

approaches
are
applied
to
obtain
a
better
knowledge
on
changes
in
the
concentration
of
metabolites
due
to
its
dietary
intake
and
allow
a
better
understanding
of
involved
metabolic
pathways
.

Eight
volunteers
daily
consumed
400
mL
of
juice
for
four
consecutive
days
and
urine
samples
were
collected
before
intake
and
24h
after
each
citrus
juice
intake
.

Urine
samples
were
analysed
by
nanoHPLC-q-TOF
,
followed
by
principal
component
analysis
(
PCA
)
and
Student's
t-test
(
p<0
.
05
)
.

PCA
showed
a
separation
between
two
groups
(
before
and
after
citrus
juice
consumption
)
.

This
approach
allowed
the
identification
of
four
endocrine
compounds
(
tetrahydroaldosterone-3-glucuronide
,
cortolone-3-glucuronide
,
testosterone-glucuronide
and
17-hydroxyprogesterone
)
,
which
belonged
to
the
steroid
biosynthesis
pathway
as
significant
metabolites
upregulated
by
citrus
juice
intake
.

Additionally
,
these
results
confirmed
the
importance
of
using
the
non-targeted
metabolomics
technique
to
identify
new
endogenous
metabolites
,
up-

as
a

The
widely
used
hypnosedative-anxiolytic
agent
R
,
S-lorazepam
is
cleared
predominantly
by
conjugation
with
glucuronic
acid
in
humans
,
but
the
enantioselective
glucuronidation
of
lorazepam
has
received
little
attention
.

The
present
study
characterized
the
kinetics
of
the
separate
R-
and
S-
enantiomers
of
lorazepam
by
human
liver
microsomes
(
HLM
)
and
by
a
panel
of
recombinant
human
UDP-glucuronosyltransferase
(
UGT
)
enzymes
.

Respective
mean
Km
and
Vmax
values
for
R-

S-
lorazepam
by
HLM
were

.

Microsomal
intrinsic
clearances
were
not
significantly
different
,
suggesting
the
in
vivo
clearances
of
R-
and
S-
lorazepam
are
likely
to
be
similar
.

Both
R-
and
S-
lorazepam
were
glucuronidated
by
UGT
2B4
,
2B7
,
and
2B15
,
while
R-lorazepam
was
additionally
metabolized
by
the
extra-hepatic
enzymes
UGT
1A7
and
1A10
.

Based
on
in
vitro
clearances
and
consideration
of
available
in
vivo
and
in
vitro
data
,
UGT2B15
is
likely
to
play
an
important
role
in
the
glucuronidation
of
R-
and
S-lorazepam
.

However
,
the
possible
contribution
of
other
enzymes
and
the
low
activities
observed
in
vitro
indicate
that
the
lorazepam
enantiomers
are
of
limited
use
as
substrate
probes
for
UGT2B15
.

In
order
to
identify
potential
drug-drug
interactions
,
codeine
,
fluconazole
,
ketamine
,
ketoconazole
,
methadone
,
morphine
,
valproic
acid
,
and
zidovudine
were
screened
as
inhibitors
of
R-
and
S-
lorazepam
glucuronidation
by
HLM
.

Of
these
drugs
,
in
vitro
-
in
vivo
extrapolation
suggested
that
only
ketoconazole
had
the
potential
to
inhibit
lorazepam
clearance
to
a
clinically
significant
extent
.
Bone

(
BMP-7
)
has
been
shown
to
inhibit
liver
and
renal
fibrosis
in
in

studies
.

There
is
no
study
to
investigate
BMP-7's
role
in
the
development
of
pulmonary
fibrosis
induced
by
silica
.

In
the
current
study
,
we
used
the
rat
model
to
explore
the
potential
antifibrotic
role
of
BMP-7
and
its
underlying
mechanism
in
silica-induced
pulmonary
fibrosis
.

Sixty
Wistar
rats
were
randomly
assigned
into
three
groups
.

Control
group
received
saline
,
silica
group
received
silica
and
BMP-7
treated
group
received
silica
and
BMP-7
.

BMP-7
was
administered
to
silica-treated
rats
intraperitoneally
at
a
dose
of
300μg
/
kg
/
injection
from
day
8
to
day
30
every
other
day
.

After
the
animals
were
sacrificed
on
day
15
and
30
,
hydroxyproline
levels
,
the
protein
expressions
of
BMP
/
Smad
and
TGF-β
/
Smad
signaling
,
and
histopathology
in
lung
tissues
were
analyzed
.

The
hydroxyproline
contents
in
BMP-7
treated
groups
were
significantly
lower
than
the
silica
groups
(
P<0
.
05
)
.

Histopathological
results
showed
BMP-7
could
reduce
the
progression
of
silica
induced
fibrosis
.

Furthermore
,
the
expression
of
p-Smad1
/
5
/
8
,
a
marker
of
BMP
/
Smad
signaling
,
was
significantly
up-regulated
in
BMP-7
treated
groups
(
P<0
.
05
)
compared
with
the
silica
groups
.

On
the
contrary
,
the
expression
of
p-Smad2
/
3
,
a
marker
for
TGF-β
/
Smad
signaling
,
reduced
significantly
in
BMP-7-treated
groups
compared
with
silica
groups
(
P<0
.
05
)
.

In
conclusion
,
the
pulmonary
fibrosis
induced
by
silica
in
rats
was
significantly
reduced
with
the
therapeutic
treatment
of
BMP-7
.

The
antifibrotic
effect
of
BMP-7
could
be
related
to
the
activation
of
BMP
/
Smad
signaling
and
inhibition
of
TGF-β
/
Smad
pathways
.

The
human
pregnane
X
receptor
(
PXR
)
regulates
genes
involved
in
drug
metabolism
and
disposition
.

PXR
associates
with
multiple
corepressors
that
attenuate
,
and
coactivators
that
enhance
its
activity
.

PXR
plays
a
vital
role
in
the
drug
metabolism
pathway
,
and
a
comprehensive
examination
of
PXR-associated
proteins
will
provide
greater
insight
into
the
regulation
of
the
receptor
and
possible
therapeutic
implications
.

We
performed
a
mass
spectrometric
screen
to
identify
PXR-associated
proteins
.

Here
we
report
that
the
tumor
suppressor
protein
p53
can
associate
with
PXR
and
downregulate
its
activity
.

A
loss-of-function
p53
mutant
(
R175H
)
interacts
with
PXR
but
does
not
repress
its
activity
.

Mutant
p53
can
relieve
the
suppressive
effect
of
wild-type
p53
by
competing
with
its
interaction
with
PXR
,
suggesting
that
protein-protein
interaction
is
required
but
not
sufficient
for
p53
to
repress
PXR
activity
.

Interestingly
,
a
PXR
variant
with
a
naturally
occurring
deletion
of
a
conserved
,
unique
sequence
in
the
ligand
binding
domain
(
PXR174-210
)
did
not
interact
with
p53
,
indicating
that
the
PXR-p53
interaction
is
specific
.

Using
a
chromatin
immunoprecipitation
assay
,
we
showed
that
p53
inhibits
the
binding
of
PXR
to
the
CYP3A4
promoter
.

The
loss
of
p53
function
in
tumor
cells
leads
to
aberrant
cell
proliferation
,
apoptosis
,
carcinogenesis
,
and
altered
sensitivity
to
chemotherapeutic
drugs
,
while
PXR
contributes
to
chemoresistance
in
many
cancer
cells
.

Our
findings
show
for
the
first
time
that
wild-type
p53
can
negatively
regulate
PXR
by
physically
associating
with
it
.

Thus
,
PXR
and
p53
appear
to
play
important
yet
opposing
roles
in
the
sensitivity
of
tumor
cells
to
chemotherapy
.

Although
the
actions
of
androgens
have
been
studied
extensively
,
the
mechanisms
underlying
oestrogen
signalling
in
prostate
cancer
are
not
fully
understood
.

In
the
present

,
we
analyzed
the
effect
of
androgens

oestrogens
on
the
expression
of
anterior

of
which
(

Quantitative

A
functional

turned
out
to
be
required
for
both
androgen
and
oestrogen
regulation
.

This
pattern

was
confirmed
in

was
also
observed

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL
RELEVANCE
:
Different

Mimosa
pigra
(
MPG
)
are
used
in
traditional
medicine
in
Madagascar
,
tropical
Africa
,
South
America
and
Indonesia
for
various
troubles
including
cardiovascular
disorders
.

AIM
OF
THE
STUDY
:
To
investigate
the
mechanisms
underlying
the
vascular
effects
of
MPG
by
assessing
in
vitro
its
antioxidant
and
anti-inflammatory
properties
,
and
its
vascular
relaxing
effects
,
and
in
vivo
,
its
action
on
hypoxic
pulmonary
hypertension
(
PAH
)
in
rats
.

MATERIAL
AND
METHODS
:
The
antioxidant
activity
of
MPG
leaf
hydromethanolic
extract
was
determined
by
using
both
the
1
,
1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl
radical
scavenging
and
the
oxygen
radical
absorbance
capacity
in
vitro
assays
.

Anti-inflammatory
properties
were
assayed
on
TNFα-induced
VCAM-1
expression
in
endothelial
cells
.

The
vasorelaxant
effect
of
MPG
extract
was
studied
on
rat
arterial
rings
pre-contracted
with
phenylephrine
(
1μM
)
in
the
presence
or
absence
of
the
endothelium
.

In
vivo
MPG
extract
effects
were
analyzed
in
chronic
hypoxic
PAH
,
obtained
by
housing
male
Wistar
rats
,
orally
treated
or
not
with
MPG
extract
(
400mg
/
kg
/
d
)
,
in
a
hypobaric
chamber
for
21
days
.

RESULTS
:
MPG
leaf
extract
had
antioxidant
and
anti-inflammatory
properties
.

It
induced
endothelium-dependent
,
NO-mediated
relaxation
of
rat
aorta
and
pulmonary
artery
.

In
vivo
,
chronic
MPG
treatment
reduced
hypoxic
PAH
in
rat
by
decreasing
by
22
.
3%
the
pulmonary
arterial
pressure
and
by
20
.
0%
and
23
.
9%
the
pulmonary
artery
and
cardiac
remodelling
,
respectively
.

This
effect
was
associated
with
a
restoration
of
endothelium
function
and
a
2
.
3-fold
increase
in
endothelial
NO
synthase
phosphorylation
.

MPG
leaf
hydromethanolic
extract
contained
tryptophan
and
flavonoids
,
including
quercetin
glycosides
.

Both
compounds
also
efficiently
limit
hypoxia-induced
PAH
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
Our
results
show
endothelial
protective
action
of
MPG
leaf
hydromethanolic
extract
which
is
likely
to
be
due
to
its
antioxidant
action
.

MPG
successfully
attenuated
the
development
of
PAH
,
thus
demonstrating
the
protective
effect
of
MPG
on
cardiovascular
diseases

Glutamate
dehydrogenase
(
GLUD
)
is
an
important
mitochondrial
enzyme
that
participates
in
neuronal
transmission
by
catalyzing
the
deamination
of
L-glutamate
,
which
serves
as
a
potent
excitatory
neurotransmitter
.

The
direct
involvement
of
GLUD
in
the
pathogenesis
of
certain
human
neurodegenerative
disorders
has
been
suggested
recently
.

To
investigate
its
possible
role
in
the
induction
and
progression
of
these
disorders
,
we
have
initiated
studies
focusing
on
the
chromosomal
organization
of
the
several
members
of
the
GLUD
family
and
their
functional
status
.

In
the
present
study
using
a
panel
of
human
x
rodent
somatic
cell
hybrids
and
in
situ
hybridization
to
metaphase
chromosomes
,
we
documented
that
the
members
of
the
GLUD
gene
family
are
dispersed
in
the
human
genome
.

The
functional
GLUD1
gene
was
mapped
to
chromosome
10q22
.
3-q23
,
and
an
intronless
processed
gene
(
GLUDP1
)
to
chromosome
Xq22-q23
,
while
the
truncated
intron-containing
GLUD
pseudogene
GLUDP2
was
also
assigned
on
chromosome
10
,
but
not
closely
linked
to
the
GLUD1
gene
.

These
results
provide
novel
information
concerning
the
chromosomal
organization
of
the
human
GLUD
gene
family
.
The
human

cell
line
HepaRG
has
been
recognized
as
a
promising
source
for
in

testing
of
metabolism
and

of
compounds
.

However
,
currently
the
hepatic
differentiation
of
these
cells
relies
on
exposure
to
dimethylsulfoxide
(
DMSO
)
,
which
,
as
a
side
effect
,
has
a
cytotoxic
effect
and
represses
an
all-round
hepatic
functionality
.

The
AMC-bioartificial

previously
been
shown
to
upregulate
various

functions
of
cultured
cells
.

We
therefore
cultured
HepaRG
cells
in
the
AMC-BAL
without
DMSO
and
characterized
the
drug
metabolism
.

Within
14
days
of
culture
,
the
HepaRG-AMC-BALs
contained
highly
polarized
viable
liver-like
tissue
with
heterogeneous
expression
of
CYP3A4
.

We
found
a
substantial
metabolism
of
the
tested
substrates
,
ranging
from
26%
(
UDP-glucuronosyltransferase
1A1
)
,
47%
(
CYP3A4
)
,
to
240%
(
CYP2C9
)
of
primary
human
hepatocytes
.

The
CYP3A4
activity
could
be
induced
2-fold
by
rifampicin
,
whereas
CYP2C9
activity
remained
equally
high
.

The
HepaRG-AMC-BAL
secreted
bile
acids
at
43%
the
rate
of
primary
human
hepatocytes
and
demonstrated
hydroxylation
,
conjugation
,
and
transport
of
bile
salts
.

Concluding
,
culturing
HepaRG
cells
in
the
AMC-BAL
yields
substantial

and
phase
2
drug
metabolism
,
while
maintaining
high
viability
,
rendering
DMSO
addition
superfluous
for
the
promotion
of
drug
metabolism
.

Therefore
,
AMC-BAL
culturing
makes
the
HepaRG
cells
more
suitable
for
testing
metabolism
and
toxicity
of
drugs
.

Utilizing
agonist-stimulated
GTPgammaS
autoradiography
,
we
analyzed
the
ability
of
preproorphanin
FQ
(
ppOFQ
)
peptides
to
stimulate
[
35S
]
-GTPgammaS
binding
in
adult
rat
brain
.

Orphanin
FQ
(
OFQ
)
stimulated
[
35S
]
-GTPgammaS
binding
in
a
pattern
similar
to
that
described
for
[
125I
]
-OFQ
at
the
endogenous
opioid
receptor-like
(
ORL1
)
receptor
.

The
ppOFQ
peptides
nocistatin
and
orphanin
FQ2
(
OFQ
II
(
1-17
)
)
had
no
effect
,
suggesting
that
they
do
not
mediate
their
reported
analgesic
effects
via
a
G
(
i
/
o
)
-coupled
receptor
(
i

e
.

opioid
or
ORL1
)
.

Unlike
OFQ
II
(
1-17
)
,
high
concentrations
of
its
C-terminal
extension
,
OFQ
II
(
1-28
)
,
stimulated
[
35S
]
-GTPgammaS
binding
in
a
mu
(
mu
)
opioid
receptor-like
distribution
and
the
effect
was
blocked
by
naloxone
.

To
explore
these
observations
,
we
evaluated
the
receptor
binding
profile
of
OFQ
II
(
1-28
)
at
the
cloned
ORL1
and
mu
opioid
receptors
.

OFQ
II
(
1-28
)
had
no
specific
binding
at
either
ORL1
or
mu
opioid
receptors
at
concentrations
up
to
50
microM
.

This
lack
of
affinity
was
not
consistent
with
a
mu-mediated
effect
,
as
suggested
by
preliminary
observation
using
functional
autoradiography
in
rat
brain
sections
.

Although
behavioral
studies
suggest
that
OFQ
II
(
1-28
)
possesses
analgesic
activity
,
this
effect
does
not
appear
to
be
mediated
via
direct
binding
at
the
mu
opioid
receptor
.

Taken
together
,
these
findings
support
the
view
that
(
1
)
OFQ
is
the
only
ppOFQ
peptide
that
binds
to
and
activates
the
ORL1
receptor
and
(
2
)
OFQ
II
(
1-28
)
does
not
bind
or
stimulate
[

-GTPgammaS
binding
in
cells
expressing
the
mu
opioid
receptor

.

Single
oral
doses
of
75
mg
,
150
mg
,
and
300
mg

,
300
mg

,
and
a

were
administered
on

occasions
1
h
before

h
,
and
the
pH
,
H

concentration
and
output
,
volume
,
and
pepsin
concentration
and
output
were
determined
.

Doses
of
150
mg
and
300
mg
nizatidine
depressed
the
secretory
response
significantly
more
than
did
cimetidine
.

The
antisecretory
effects
of
75
mg
nizatidine
was
no
different
than
that
of
300
mg
cimetidine
.

Nizatidine
300
mg
inhibited
pepsin
output
significantly
more
than
volume
.

Although
pepsin
concentration
was
reduced
more
than
volume
,
the
difference
was
not
significant
.

These
observations
,
in
contrast
to
results
of

,
suggest
a
direct
inhibition
of
pepsin
secretion
,

We
have
reported
that
a
deficiency
of
tetrahydrobiopterin
(
BH
(

)
)
,
an
active
cofactor
of
endothelial
NO
synthase
(

)
,
contributes
to
the
endothelial
dysfunction
through
reduced
eNOS
activity
and
increased
superoxide
anion
(
O
(
2
)
(
-
)
)
generation
in
the
insulin-resistant
state
.

To
further
confirm
this
hypothesis
,
we
investigated
the
effects
of
dietary
treatment
with
BH
(

)
on
endothelium-dependent
arterial
relaxation
and
vascular
oxidative
stress
in
the

for

significantly
increased
the
BH
(

content
in
cardiovascular
tissues
of
rats
fed
high
levels
of
fructose
(
fructose-fed
rats
)
.

Impairment
of
endothelium-dependent
arterial
relaxation
in
the
aortic
strips
of
the
fructose-fed
rats
was
reversed
with
BH
(
4
)
treatment
.

The
BH
(
4
)
treatment
was
associated
with
a
2-fold
increase
in
eNOS
activity
as
well
as
a
70%
reduction
in
endothelial
O
(
2
)
(
-
)
production
compared
with
those
in
fructose-fed
rats
.

The
BH
(
4
)
treatment
also
partially
improved
the
insulin
sensitivity
and
blood
pressure
,
as
well
as
the
serum
triglyceride
concentration
,
in
the
fructose-fed
rats
.

Moreover
,
BH
(
4
)
treatment
of
the
fructose-fed
rats
markedly
reduced
the
lipid
peroxide
content
of
both
aortic
and
cardiac
tissues
and
inhibited
the
activation
of
2
redox-sensitive
transcription
factors
,
nuclear
factor-kappaB
and
activating
protein-1
,
which
were
increased
in
fructose-fed
rats
.

The
BH
(
4
)
treatment
of
control
rats
did
not
have
any
significant
effects
on
these
parameters
.

These
results
indicate
that
BH
(

augmentation
is
essential
for
the
restoration
of
eNOS
function
and
the
reduction
of

a

When

was
co-administered
with

Osteoporosis
is
a
significant
health
concern
for
the
elderly;
conjugated
linoleic
acid
(
CLA
)
has
been
shown
to
improve
overall
bone
mass
when
calcium
is
included
as
a
co-supplement
.

However
,
potential
effects
of
CLA
and
calcium
on
bone
mass
during
a
period
of
bone
loss
have
not
been
reported
.

The
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
determine
how
dietary
calcium
modulates
the
effects
of
conjugated
linoleic
acid
(
CLA
)
in
preventing
bone
loss
,
using
an
ovariectomised
mouse
model
.

CLA
supplementation
significantly
prevented
ovariectomy-associated
weight
and
fat
mass
gain
,
compared
to
non-supplemented
controls
.

CLA
significantly
increased
bone
markers
without
major
changes
in
bone
mineral
composition
in
the
femur
compared
to

controls
.

CLA
treatment
increased

,
while
serum

,
25-dihydroxyvitamin

Meanwhile
,
CLA
significantly
reduced

The
data
suggest
that

along
with

calcium
,
has
great
potential
to
be
used
to
prevent
bone

The
subfamily
Phyllomedusinae
has
attracted
a
great
interest
of
many
researchers
mainly
due
to
the
high
diversity
of
these
frog
species
and
plethora
of
pharmacological
activities
frequently
observed
for
their
skin
secretions
.

Despite
of
this
fact
,
mainly
for
new
species
,
limited
information
is
available
regarding
the
molecular
composition
of
these
skin
secretions
and
the
cellular
components
involved
in
their
production
.

Phyllomedusa
nordestina
is
a
recently
described
Brazilian
frog
species
also
popularly
known
as
'tree-frogs'
.

Aiming
at
contributing
to
the
biological
knowledge
of
this
species
,
we
show
here
the
gene
expression
profile
of
this
frog
skin
secretion
using
a
global
ESTs
analysis
of
a
cDNA
library
.

The
marked
aspect
of
this
analysis
revealed
a
significant
higher
transcriptional
level
of
the
opioid
peptide
dermorphins
in
P
.

nordestina
skin
secretion
than
in
Phyllomedusa
hypochondrialis
,
which
is
its
closest
related
species
,
belonging
both
to
the
same
phylogenetic
group
.

Precursors
of
bioactive
peptides
as
dermaseptins
,
phylloseptins
,
tryptophyllins
,
and
bradykinin-like
peptideswere
also
found
in
this
library
.

Transcripts
encoding
proteins
related
to
ordinary
cellular
functions
and
pathways
were
also
described
.

Some
of
them
are
chiefly
involved
in
the
production
of
the
skin
secretion
.

Taken
together
,
the
data
reported
here
constitute
a
contribution
to
the
characterization
of
the
molecular
diversity
of
gene-encoded
polypeptides
with
potential
possibility
of
pharmacological
exploitation
.

The
transcriptional
composition
of
the
skin
secretion
may
also
help
to
give
the
necessary
support
for
the
definition
of

as
a
new

actually
relies
basically

The
cDNA
encoding
PH-20
hyaluronidase
from
human
sperm
has
been
mutated
at
five
positions
by
in
vitro
mutagenesis
.

We
have
changed
three
acidic
amino
acids
and
two
arginine
residues
that
are
conserved
in
the
sequence
of
mammalian
PH-20
polypeptides
as
well
as
in
the
hyaluronidases
from
bee
and
hornet
venom
.

Of
the
former
,
the
mutants
[
Gln113
]
PH-20
and
[
Gln249
]
PH-20
had
no
detectable
enzymatic
activity;
the
mutant
[
Asn111
]
PH-20
had
about
3%
activity
.

The
mutant
[
Thr252
]
PH-20
was
also
inactive
,
while
[
Gly176
]
PH-20
had
only
about
1%
activity
.

This
indicates
that
the
PH-20
hyaluronidases
,
like
numerous
enzymes
that
hydrolyze
glycosidic
bonds
,
have
acidic
amino
acids
in
their
active
site
.

Moreover
,
for
the
binding
of
the
substrate
,
the
polyanion
hyaluronan
,
arginine
residues
appear
to
be
essential
.
Global
hypomethylation
,
gene-specific

,
and
genome
instability
are

events
in
tumorigenesis
.

To
date
,
few
studies
have
examined
the
aberrant
DNA
methylation
patterns
in
coke
oven
workers
,
who
are
highly
at
risk
of
lung
cancer
by
occupational
exposure
to
polycyclic
aromatic
hydrocarbons
(
PAHs
)
.

We
recruited
82
PAH-exposed
workers
and
62
unexposed
controls
,
assessed
exposure
levels
by
urinary
1-hydroxypyrene
,
and
measured
genetic
damages
by
comet
assay
,
bleomycin
sensitivity
,
and
micronucleus
assay
.

The
PAHs
in
coke
oven
emissions
(
COE
)
were
estimated
based
on
toxic
equivalency
factors
.

We
used
bisulfite-PCR
pyrosequencing
to
quantitate
DNA
methylation
in
long
interspersed
nuclear
element-1
(
LINE-1
)
and
O

-methylguanine-DNA
methyltransferase
(
MGMT
)
.

Further
,
the
methylation
alteration
was
also
investigated
in
COE-treated
human
bronchial
epithelial
(
16HBE
)
cells
.

We
found
there
are
higher
levels
of
PAHs
in
COE
.

Among
PAH-exposed
workers
,
LINE-1
and
MGMT
methylation
levels
(
with
CpG
site
specificity
)
were
significantly
lowered
.

LINE-1
,
MGMT
,
and
its
hot
CpG
site-specific
methylation
were
negatively
correlated
with
urinary
1-hydroxypyrene
levels
(
r

049
and
r

.
176
,
p
=

.
034
,
respectively
)
.

In
addition
,
LINE-1
methylation
was
inversely
associated
with
comet
tail
moment
and
micronucleus
frequency
,
and
a
significant
increase
of
micronucleus
in
low
MGMT
methylation
group
.

In
vitro
study
revealed
that
treatment
of
COE
in
16HBE
cells
resulted
in
higher
production
of
BPDE-DNA
adducts
,
LINE-1
hypomethylation
,
hypomethylation
,
and
suppression
of
MGMT
expression
.

These
findings
suggest
hypomethylation
of
LINE-1
and
MGMT
promoter
could
be
used
as
markers
for
PAHs
exposure
and
merit
further
investigation

by

.

However
,
the
details
of
the
apoptosis-inducing
mechanism
remain
obscure
.

The
present
study
showed
that
the
induction
of
apoptosis
by
N-BPs
in
hematopoietic
tumor
cells
is
mediated
by
mitochondrial
apoptotic
signaling
pathways
,
which
are
activated
by
the
suppression
of
geranylgeranyl
pyrophosphate
(
GGPP
)
biosynthesis
.

Furthermore
,
N-BPs
decreased
the
levels
of
phosphorylated
extracellular
signal-regulated
kinase
(
ERK
)
and
mTOR
via
suppression
of
Ras
prenylation
and
enhanced
Bim
expression
.

The
present
results
indicated
that
N-BPs
induce
apoptosis
by
decreasing
the
mitochondrial
transmembrane
potential
,
increasing
the
activation
of
caspase-9
and
caspase-3
,
and
enhancing
Bim
expression
through
inhibition
of
the
Ras

MEK
/
ERK
and

pathways
.

The

Conformational
analyses
have
been
performed
on
several
phenothiazine
and
thioxanthene
dopamine
antagonists
using
the
MM2-87
program
and
parameter
set
.

The
compounds
that
were
examined
are
thioridazine
(

)
,
methotrimeprazine
(
3
)
,
cis-
and
trans-chlorprothixene
,
and
a
piperidylidene

of
chlorprothixene
.

In
addition
,
(
+
)
-2
and
(
-
)
-3
were
determined
by
X-ray
crystallography
to
have
the
R
absolute
configuration
.

The
above
compounds
were
superimposed
onto
loxapine
,
which
was
used
as
a
template
for
the
previously
proposed
dopamine
D2
receptor
ligand
model
.

The
conformational
properties
and
receptor
affinities
of
these
compounds
were
found
to
be
entirely
consistent
with
the
ligand
model
.

For
example
,
a
conformer
of
(
+
)
-R-2
that
is
consistent
with
the
ligand
model
is
lower
in
energy
than
a
consistent
conformer
for
(
-
)
-S-2
,
which
agrees
with
the
higher
D2
receptor
affinity
of
the
former
.

Similarly
,
in
agreement
with
the
much
higher
affinity
of
(
-
)
-R-3
relative
to
(
+
)
-S-3
,
only
the
former
contains
a
low
energy
conformer
consistent
with
the
ligand
model
.

The
ligand
model
is
also
consistent
with
the
greater
potency
of
cis-thioxanthenes
over
the
trans
isomers
.

These
results
emphasize
the
importance
of
the
correct
orientation
of
the
ammonium
hydrogen
for
high
affinity
at
the
D2
receptor
.

Protein
kinase
C
(
PKC
)
isozymes
undergo
down-regulation
upon
sustained
stimulation
.

Previous
studies
have
pointed
to
the
existence
of
both
proteasome-dependent
and
-independent
pathways
of
PKCα
processing
.

Here
we
demonstrate
that
these
down-regulation
pathways
are
engaged
in
different
subcellular
compartments;
proteasomal
degradation
occurs
mainly
at
the
plasma
membrane
,
whereas
non-proteasomal
processing
occurs
in
the
perinuclear
region
.

Using
cholesterol
depletion
,
pharmacological
inhibitors
,
RNA
interference
,
and
dominant-negative
mutants
,
we
define
the
mechanisms
involved
in
perinuclear
accumulation
of
PKCα
and
identify
the
non-proteasomal
mechanism
mediating
its
degradation
.

We
show
that
intracellular
accumulation
of
PKCα
involves
at
least
two
clathrin-independent
,
cholesterol
/
lipid
raft-mediated
pathways
that
do
not
require
ubiquitination
of
the
protein;
one
is
dynamin-dependent
and
likely
involves
caveolae
,
whereas
the
other
is
dynamin-
and
small
GTPase-independent
.

Internalized
PKCα
traffics

and

and
(

)
inhibition
of
its

limited
dephosphorylation
of
PKCα
occurs
during
trafficking
,
with
fully

These
studies
define
a
novel

widespread
mechanism
of

of
PKCα

that
involves
endocytic
trafficking
and
lysosome-mediated

The

flavin
oxidoreductase
from
Aminobacter
aminovorans
is
an
NADH-specific
flavin
reductase
herein
designated
FRD
(
Aa

.

FRD

,
molar
absorption
coefficient
,
and
effects
of
phosphate

strength
and

Evidence
from
this
work
favors
the
classification
of
FRD
(
Aa
)
as
a
flavin
cofactor-utilizing
class
I
flavin
reductase
.

The
isolated
native
FRD
(
Aa
)
contained
about
0
.
5
bound
riboflavin-5'-phosphate
(
FMN
)
per
enzyme
monomer
,
but
one
bound
flavin
cofactor
per
monomer
was
obtainable
in
the
presence
of
excess
FMN
or
riboflavin
.

In
addition
,
FRD
(
Aa
)
holoenzyme
also
utilized
FMN
,
riboflavin
,
or
FAD
as
a
substrate
.

Steady-state

of
substrate
titrations
,

and

)
indicated
an
ordered
sequential
mechanism
with
NADH
as
the
first
binding
substrate
and
reduced
FMN
as
the
first
leaving
product
.

This
is
contrary
to
the
ping-pong
mechanism
shown
by
other
class
I
flavin
reductases
.

The
FMN
bound
to
the
native
FRD
(
Aa
)
can
be
fully
reduced
by
NADH
and
subsequently
reoxidized
by
oxygen
.

No
NADH
binding
was
detected
using
90
microM

apoenzyme
and

All
results
favor
the
interpretation
that
the
bound
FMN
was
a
cofactor
rather
than
a
substrate
.

It
is
highly
unusual
that
a
flavin
reductase
using
a
sequential
mechanism
would
require
a
flavin
cofactor
to
facilitate
redox
exchange

NADH

Polymethacrylates

Here
,
we

several
Eudragit
E
PO
(
n-butyl-
,
dimethylaminoethyl-
,
methyl-methacrylate-terpolymer
)
analogues
via
free
radical
polymerization
.

These
polymers
are
processed
via
hot
melt
extrusion
,
followed
by
injection
molding
and
evaluated
as
carriers
to
produce

.

Three
chemical
modifications
increased
the
glass

temperature
of
the
polymer
:
(
a
)
substitution
of
n-butyl

t-butyl
groups
,
(

of

dimethylaminoethyl
methacrylate
(
DMAEMA
)
content
,
and
(
c
)
incorporation
of
a
bulky
isobornyl
repeating
unit
.

These
structural
modifications
revealed
the
possibility
to
increase
the
mechanical
stability
of
the
tablets
via
altering
the
polymer
Tg
without
influencing
the

The

be
crucial
with

interaction
(
essential
in

An

The
discovery
that
rapamycin
extends
the
life
span
of
diverse
organisms
has
triggered
many
studies
aimed
at
identifying
the
underlying
molecular
mechanisms
.

Mammalian
target
of
rapamycin
complex
1
(
mTORC1
)
regulates
cell
growth
and
may
regulate
organismal
aging
by
controlling
mRNA
translation
.

However
,
how
inhibiting
mTORC1
and
decreasing
protein
synthesis
can
extend
life
span
remains
an
unresolved
issue
.

We
showed
that
constitutively
active
mTORC1
signaling
increased
general
protein
synthesis
but
unexpectedly
reduced
the
quality
of
newly
synthesized
polypeptides
.

We
demonstrated
that
constitutively
active
mTORC1
decreased
translation
fidelity
by
increasing
the
speed
of
ribosomal
elongation
.

Conversely
,
rapamycin
treatment
restored
the
quality
of
newly
synthesized
polypeptides
mainly
by
slowing
the
rate
of
ribosomal
elongation
.

We
also
found
distinct
roles
for
mTORC1
downstream
targets
in
maintaining
protein
homeostasis
.

Loss
of
S6
kinases
,
but
not
4E-BP
family

are
both
involved
in
regulation
of
translation
,
attenuated
the
effects
of
rapamycin
on
the
quality
of
newly
translated
proteins
.

Our
results
reveal
a
mechanistic
connection
between
mTORC1
and
protein
quality
,
highlighting
the
central
role
of
nutrient
signaling
in

Tyrosinase
inhibitors

Rhododendron
collettianum

their
structure-activity

(
SAR
)
studies

Drugs
used
to
treat
attention
deficit
hyperactivity
disorder
(
ADHD
)
improve
prefrontal
cortex
(
PFC
)
-dependent
cognitive
function
.

The
majority
of
ADHD-related
treatments
act
either
as
dual
norepinephrine
(
NE
)
and
dopamine
(
DA
)
reuptake
inhibitors
(
psychostimulants
)
or
selective
NE
reuptake
inhibitors
(
SNRIs
)
.

Certain
benztropine
analogs
act
as
highly
selective
DA
reuptake
inhibitors
while
lacking
the
reinforcing
actions
,
and
thus
abuse
potential
,
of
psychostimulants
.

To
assess
the
potential
use
of
these
compounds
in
the
treatment
of
ADHD
,
we
examined
the
effects
of
a
well-characterized
benztropine
analog
,
AHN
2-005
,
on
performance
of
rats
in
a
PFC-dependent
delayed-alternation
task
of
spatial
working
memory
.

Similar
to
that
seen
with
all
drugs
currently
approved
for
ADHD
,
AHN
2-005
dose-dependently
improved
performance
in
this
task
.

Clinically-relevant
doses
of
psychostimulants
and
SNRIs
elevate
NE
and
DA
preferentially
in
the
PFC
.

Despite
the
selectivity
of
this
compound
for
the
DA
transporter
,
additional
microdialysis
studies
demonstrated
that
a
cognition-enhancing
dose
of
AHN
2-005
that
lacked
locomotor
activating
effects
increased
extracellular
levels
of
both
DA
and
NE
in
the
PFC
.

AHN
2-005
produced
a
larger
increase
in
extracellular
DA
in
the
nucleus
accumbens
,
although
the
magnitude
of
this
was
well
below
that
seen
with
motor
activating
doses
of
psychostimulants
.

Collectively
,
these
observations
suggest
that
benztropine
analogs
may
be
efficacious
in
the
treatment
of
ADHD
or
other
disorders
associated
with
PFC
dysfunction
.

These
studies
provide
a
strong
rationale
for
future
research
focused
on
the
neural
mechanisms
contributing
to
the
cognition-enhancing
actions
and
the
potential
clinical
utility
of
AHN

and

To

the

we
examined

Metallothionein
(
MT
)
has
a
potential
as
a
protein
therapeutic
for
the
treatment
of
this
disease
due
to
its
anti-oxidative
effects
under
stressful
conditions
.

In
spite
of
its
therapeutic
potential
,
efficient
delivery
systems
need
to
be
developed
to
overcome
limitations
such
as
low
transduction
efficiency
,
instability
and
short
half-life
in
the
body
.

To
enhance
intra-cellular
transduction
efficiency
,
Tat
sequence
as
a
protein
transduction
domain
(
PTD
)
was
fused
with
MT
in
a
recombinant
method
.

Anti-apoptotic
and
anti-oxidative
effects
of
Tat-MT
fusion
protein
were
evaluated
under
hyperglycemia
and
hypoxia
stress
conditions
in
cultured
H9c2
cells
.

Recovery
of
cardiac
functions
by
anti-apoptotic
and
anti-fibrotic
effects
of
Tat-MT
was
confirmed
in
an
ischemia
/
reperfusion
(
I
/
R
)
rat
myocardial
infarction
model
.

Tat-MT
fusion
protein
effectively
protected
H9c2
cells
under
stressful
conditions
by
reducing
intracellular
ROS
production
and
inhibiting
caspase-3
activation
.

Tat-MT
fusion
protein
inhibited
apoptosis
,
reduced
fibrosis
area
and
enhanced
cardiac
functions
in
I
/
R
.

Tat-MT
fusion
protein
could
be
a
promising
therapeutic
for
the
treatment
of
ischemic
heart
diseases

Troglitazone
,
bosentan
and
glibenclamide
inhibit
the
bile
salt
export
pump
(
Bsep
)
which
transports
taurocholate
into
bile
.

Sandwich-cultured
rat
hepatocytes
maintain
functional
sodium
taurocholate
co-transporting
polypeptide
and
Bsep
transport
proteins
,
and
may
be
useful
to
study
inhibition
of
transport
by
xenobiotics
at
concentrations
below
the
lowest
observable
adverse
effect
level
(
LOAEL
)
.

The
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
compare
viability
assessments
determined
with
the
neutral
red
,
lactate
dehydrogenase
(
LDH
)
,
alamar
blue
,
3-

,

)
and
propidium
iodide
assays
in
sandwich-cultured
rat
hepatocytes
following
exposure
to
xenobiotics
known
to
inhibit
Bsep
,
and
to
define
the
LOAEL
for
these
xenobiotics
in
this
system
.

The
neutral
red
assay
was
not
amenable
to
use
in
this
model
due
to
crystal
formation
on
the
collagen
.

Troglitazone
decreased
viability
in
every
assay
examined
,
with
a
LOAEL
approximately
100
microM
.

Bosentan
also
decreased
viability
as
measured
by
the
LDH
,
MTT
and
propidium
iodide
assays
,
with
a
LOAEL
approximately
200
microM;
however
,
a
significant
decrease
in
viability
was
not
observed
with
the
alamar
blue
assay
.

Glibenclamide
did
not
decrease
viability
with
any
assay
at
the
xenobiotic
concentrations
examined
in
this
study
.

Based
on
the
results
of
this
study
,
the
LDH
or
propidium
iodide
assays
would
be
the
methods
of
choice
to
assess
viability
in
sandwich-cultured
rat
hepatocytes
after
xenobiotic
exposure
.

OBJECTIVES
:
The
alkaloid
galantamine
(
GAL
)
,
which
exhibits
a
combined
anticholinesterase
and
direct
parasympathomimetic
mechanism
of
action
,
is
employed
in
conjunction
with
therapeutic
interventions
in
the
stimulation
of
central
cholinergic
transfer
in
cognitive
diseases
.

We
attempted
to
achieve
pharmacologically-induced
enhancement
of
the
parasympathomimetic
activity
of
GAL
in
the
key
areas
of
rat
brain
,
using
an
interactive
combination
of
the
alkaloid
with
the
transmembrane
enhancer
L-carnitine
(
CAR
)
.

METHODS
:
We
investigated
activities
of
acetylcholinesterase
(
AChE
)
in
brain
areas
(
frontal
cortex
,
basal
ganglia
,
septum
and
hippocampus
)
and
the
hypophysis
,
and
that
of
butyrylcholinesterase
(
BuChE
)
in
plasma
and
liver
.

RESULTS
:
Following
administration
of
the
highest
of
the
GAL
doses
used
(
2
.
5;
5;
10
mg
/
kg
i
.

m
.

)
,
AChE
activity
decreased
mainly
in
the
frontal
cortex
,
hippocampus
and
hypophysis
.

In
the
interaction
of
GAL
and
CAR
,
AChE
inhibition
was
stronger
but
without
any
statistical
significance
.

The
peripheral
inhibition
of
BuChE
was
found
to
be
dose-dependent
.

Premedication
by
CAR
led
to
a
slight
change
in
the
values
of
the
activities
monitored
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
CAR
in
terms
of
positive
modulation
of
GAL
targeting
to
the
central
nervous
system
had
no
statistically
significant
effect
.

In
response
to
intense
stress
,
the
tumor
protein
p53
(
p53
)
tumor
suppressor
rapidly
mounts
a
direct
mitochondrial
death
program
that
precedes
transcription-mediated
apoptosis
.

By
eliminating
severely
damaged
cells
,
this
pathway
contributes
to
tumor
suppression
as
well
as
to
cancer
cell
killing
induced
by
both
genotoxic
drugs
and
non-genotoxic
p53-reactivating
molecules
.

Here
we
have
explored
the
role
had
in
this
pathway
by
the
prolyl-isomerase
Pin1
(
peptidylprolyl
cis
/
trans
isomerase
,
NIMA-interacting
1
)
,
a
crucial
transducer
of
p53's
phosphorylation
into
conformational
changes
unleashing
its
pro-apoptotic
activity
.

We
show
that
Pin1
promotes
stress-induced
localization
of
p53
to
mitochondria
both
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
.

In
particular
,
we
demonstrate
that
upon
stress-induced
phosphorylation
of
p53
on
Ser46
by
homeodomain
interacting
protein
kinase
2
,
Pin1
stimulates
its
mitochondrial
trafficking
signal
,
that
is
,
monoubiquitination
.

This
pathway
is
induced
also
by
the
p53-activating
molecule
RITA
,
and
we
demonstrate
the
strong
requirement
of
Pin1
for
the
induction
of
mitochondrial
apoptosis
by
this
compound
.

These
findings
have
significant
implications
for
treatment
of
p53-expressing
tumors
and
for
prospective
use
of
p53-activating
compounds
in
clinics
.

Master

of

was
carried
out
to
determine

.

Geometry

were
performed
using
the

.

Additional

were
calculated
using
MP2
/

+
G
(
2d
,

.

Results
were
examined
in
terms
of
the
binding
order
of
various
anions
as
well
as
the
added
binding
strength
from
additional
halogen
bonding
(
XB
)
interactions
.

The
relative
binding
energies
of
ions
were
generally
consistent
with
the
ordering
previously
reported
from
solution
phase
experiments;
however
,
the
relatively
strong
binding
of
H2PO4
(
-
)
to
the
bidentate
receptor
contrasted
the
solution
phase
observation
of
oxoanions
having
weaker
interactions
when
compared
to
halides
.

An
increase
in
the
energy
required
to
remove
the
same
anion
from
the
tridentate
receptor
when
compared
to
the
bidentate
and
monodentate
receptors
is
explained
as
being
due
to
the
increase
in
halogen
bonding
interactions
.

The
possibility
of
mixed
halogen
and
hydrogen
bonded
complexes
were
considered
.

focuses
on
an

(
NIR
)
spectroscopic
method
for
determining
the
drug
content
of
powder
mixtures
and
tablets
during
a

process
.

Tablets
consisting
of
acetaminophen
(
20-30%
)
,

07-78
.
93%
)
and
magnesium

were
prepared
in
a
continuous

line
that
consisted
of
two
loss-in-weight
feeders
,
one
for
acetaminophen
and
one
for
premixed
lactose
and
magnesium
stearate
,
and
a
continuous
mixer
followed
by
a
rotary
tablet
press
.

NIR
spectroscopy
was
applied
to
the
continuous
mixer
and
tablet
press
to
perform
a
100%

at
full
tableting

.

The
UV-spectrophotometric
method
was
used
as
an
off-line
reference
method
to
determine
the
acetaminophen
content
in
the
samples
.

The
powder
mixture
and
tablet
samples
were
taken
during
the
process
for
the
calibration
of
continuous
mixer
and

press
,
respectively
.

For
the
continuous
mixer
,
model
creation
with
the

)
values
of

975%
and
0

,
respectively
.

For

values
were
0

Among

Work
from
our
laboratory
suggests
that
retinoic
acid
(
RA
)
influences
neuron
development
in
the
postnatal
olfactory
epithelium
(
OE
)
.

The
studies
reported
here
were
carried
out
to
identify
and
localize
retinaldehyde

(
RALDH
)
expression
in
postnatal
rat
OE
to
gain
a
better
understanding
of
potential
in

RA
synthesis
sites
in
this
continuously
regenerating
tissue
.

,

,
and

mRNAs
were
detected
in
postnatal
rat
olfactory
tissue
by
RT-PCR
analysis
,
but
RALDH

and
2
transcripts
were
predominant
.

RALDH

The

These
findings
support
the
hypothesis
that

is
synthesized
in
the
postnatal
OE
(
catalyzed

.

Silexan
(

were
administered
orally
.

Formal

was
excluded
if
the

confidence
interval
(
CI
)
for
the

Results
:
According
to
the

,
silexan
had
no

confirmed
this
result
.

Mean

were
close
to
unity
.

9-cis-retinal
are
low
relative
to
other
substrates;
9-cis-retinal
is
more
reactive
than
all-trans-retinal
.

The
reduction
of
all-trans-
or
9-cis-retinals
coupled
to
the
oxidation
of
ethanol
by
NAD
(
+
)
is
as
efficient
as
the
reduction
with
NADH
.

However
,
the
Michaelis
constant
for
ethanol
is
about
100
mM
,
which
indicates
that
the
activity
would
be
lower
at
physiologically
relevant
concentrations
of
ethanol
.

Simulations
of
the
oxidation
of
retinol

and
human
aldehyde
dehydrogenase
(

)
,
using
rate
constants
estimated
for
all
steps
in
the
mechanism
,
suggest
that
ethanol
(
50
mM
)
would
modestly
decrease
production
of
retinoic
acid
.

However
,
if
the
K
(
m
)
for
ethanol
were
smaller
,
as
for
human
ADH4
,
the
rate
of
retinol
oxidation
and
formation
of
retinoic
acid
would
be
significantly
decreased
during
metabolism
of
50
mM
ethanol
.

The
mitochondrial
respiratory
chain
complex
IV
(
cytochrome
c
oxidase
)
is
a
multi-subunit
enzyme
that
transfers
electrons
from
cytochrome
c
to
molecular
oxygen
,
yielding
water
.

Its
biogenesis
requires
concerted
expression
of
mitochondria-
and
nuclear-encoded
subunits
and
assembly
factors
.

In
this
report
,
we
describe
a
homozygous
missense
mutation
in
FAM36A
from
a
patient
who
displays
ataxia
and
muscle
hypotonia
.

The
FAM36A
gene
is
a
remote
,
putative
ortholog
of
the
fungal
complex
IV
assembly
factor
COX20
.

Messenger
RNA
(

)
and
protein

analyses
support
the
involvement
of
FAM36A
in
complex
IV
function
in

.

The

154A>C
mutation
in
the
FAM36A
gene
,
a
mutation
that
is
absent
in
sequenced
exomes
,
leads
to
a
reduced
activity
and
lower
levels
of
complex
IV
and
its
protein
subunits
.

The
FAM36A
protein
is
nearly
absent
in
patient's
fibroblasts
.

Cells
affected
by
the
mutation
accumulate
subassemblies
of
complex
IV
that
contain
COX1
but
are
almost
devoid
of
COX2
protein
.

We
observe
co-purification
of
FAM36A
and
COX2
proteins
,
supporting
that
the
FAM36A
defect
hampers
the
early
step
of
complex
IV
assembly
at
the
incorporation
of
the
COX2
subunit
.

Lentiviral
complementation
of

FAM36A
increases
the
complex
IV
activity
as
well
as
the
amount
of

subunits
.

These
results
establish
the
function
of
the

This
review
reports
on
the
pharmacodynamics
of
the
new
antipsychotic
risperidone
.

The
primary
action
of
risperidone
is
serotonin
5-HT2
receptor
blockade
as
shown
by
displacement
of
radioligand
binding
(
Ki
:
0
.
16
nM
)
,
activity
on
isolated
tissues
(
EC50
:

.
5
nM
)
,
and
antagonism
of
peripherally
(
ED50
:

0011
mg
/

)
and
centrally
(
ED50
:
0
.
014
mg
/
kg
)
acting
5-HT2
receptor
agonists
in
rats
.

Risperidone
is
at
least
as
potent
as
the
specific
5-HT2
receptor
antagonist
ritanserin
in
these
tests
.

Risperidone
is
also
a
potent
dopamine
D2
receptor
antagonist
as
indicated
by
displacement
of
radioligand
binding
(
Ki
:
1
.
4
nM
)
,
activity
in
isolated
striatal
slices
(
IC50
:

)
,
and
antagonism
of
peripherally
(
ED50
:

0057
mg

)
and
centrally

D2
receptor
agonists
(
ED50
:
0
.
056-0
.
15
mg
/
kg
in
rats
)
.

Risperidone
shows
all
effects
common
to
D2
antagonists
,
including
enhancement
of
prolactin
release
.

However
,
some
central
effects
such
as
catalepsy
and
blockade
of
motor
activity
occur
at
high
doses
only
.

Risperidone
is
4-10
times
less
potent
than
haloperidol
as
a
central
D2
antagonist
in
rats
and
it
differs
from
haloperidol
by
the
following
characteristics
:
predominant
5-HT2
antagonism;
LSD
antagonism;
effects
on
sleep;
smooth
dose-response
curves
for
D2
antagonism;
synergism
of
combined
5-HT2
/
D2
antagonism;
pronounced
effects
on
amphetamine-induced
oxygen
consumption;
increased
social
interaction;
and
pronounced
effects
on
dopamine
(
DA
)
turnover
.

Risperidone
displays
similar
activity
at
pre-
and
postsynaptic
D2
receptors
and
at
D2
receptors
from
various
rat
brain
regions
.

The
binding
affinity
for
D4
and
D3
receptors
is
5
and
9
times
weaker
,
respectively
,
than
for
D2
receptors;
interaction
with
D1
receptors
occurs
only
at
very
high
concentrations
.

The
pharmacological
profile
of
risperidone
includes
interaction
with
histamine
H1
and
alpha-adrenergic
receptors
but
the
compound
is
devoid
of
significant
interaction
with
cholinergic
and
a
variety
of
other
types
of
receptors
.

Risperidone
has
excellent
oral
activity
,
a
rapid
onset
,
and
a
24-h
duration
of
action
.

Its
major
metabolite
,
9-hydroxyrisperidone
,
closely
mimics
risperidone
in
pharmacodynamics
.

Risperidone
can
be
characterized
as
a
potent
D2
antagonist
with
predominant
5HT2
antagonistic
activity
and
optimal
pharmacokinetic
properties

Alzheimer's

Release
from
the
gland
of
the
reproductive
hormones
luteinising
hormone
and
follicle-stimulating
hormone
is
regulated
primarily
by
hypothalamically-derived
gonadotrophin-releasing
hormone
(
GnRH
)
,
although
other
releasing
factors
(
RF
)
have
been
postulated
to
exist
.

Using
a
bioinformatic
approach
,
we
have
identified
a
novel
peptide
,
phoenixin
,
that
regulates
pituitary
gonadotrophin
secretion
by
modulating
the
expression
of
the
GnRH
receptor
,
an
action
with
physiologically
relevant
consequences
.

Compromise
of
phoenixin
in
vivo
using
small
interfering
RNA
resulted
in
the
delayed
appearance
of
oestrus
and
a
reduction
in
GnRH
receptor
expression
in
the
pituitary
.

Phoenixin
may
represent
a
new
class
of
hypothalamically-derived
pituitary
priming
factors
that
sensitise
the
pituitary
to
the
action
of
other

Because
of
its
relative
abundance
in

,
increased
serum
ALT
activity
is
generally
considered
indicative
of

In

IMPLICATIONS
:
Miosis
is
often
considered
an
effect
of
opioid
administration
during
general
anesthesia
,
but
other
drugs
,
such
as
antiemetics
,
might
produce
a
similar
effect
on
the
pupil
.

This
study
demonstrates
that
2
antiemetics
,
droperidol
and
metoclopramide
,
constrict
the
pupil
and
block
the
pupillary
dilation
brought
about
by

During
more
than
five
decades
,
pyridinium
oximes
have
been
developed
as
therapeutic
agents
used
in
the
medical
treatment
of
poisoning
with
organophosphorus
compounds
.

Their
mechanism
of
action
is
reactivation
of
acetylcholinesterase
(
AChE
)
inhibited
by
organophosphorus
agents
.

Organophosphorus
compounds
(
OPC
)
are
used
as
pesticides
and
developed
as
warfare
nerve
agents
such
as
tabun
,
soman
,
sarin
,
VX
and
others
.

Exposure
to
even
small
amounts
of
an
OPC
can
be
fatal
and
death
is
usually
caused
by
respiratory
failure
resulting
from
paralysis
of
the
diaphragm
and
intercostal
muscles
,
depression
of
the
brain
respiratory
center
,
bronchospasm
,
and
excessive
bronchial
secretions
.

The
mechanism
of
OPC
poisoning
involves
phosphorylation
of
the
serine
hydroxyl
group
at
the
active
site
of
AChE
leading
to
the
inactivation
of
this
essential
enzyme
,
which
has
an
important
role
in
neurotransmission
.

AChE
inhibition
results
in
the
accumulation
of
acetylcholine
at
cholinergic
receptor
sites
,
producing
continuous
stimulation
of
cholinergic
fibers
throughout
the
central
and
peripheral
nervous
systems
.

combination
of
an
antimuscarinic
agent

as
one
of
the
standard
pyridinium
oximes
(
pralidoxime
,
trimedoxime
,
obidoxime
,
HI-6
)
and
diazepam
has
been
used
for
the
treatment
of
organophosphate
poisoning
in
humans
.

Despite
enormous
efforts
devoted
to
synthesis
and
development
of
new
pyridinium
oximes
as
potential
antidotes
against
poisoning
with
OPC
,
only
four
compounds
have
found
their
application
in
human
medicine
so
far
.

However
,
they
differ
in
their
activity
in
poisoning
with
warfare
nerve
agents
and
pesticides
and
there
is
still
no
universal
broad-spectrum
oxime
capable
of
protecting
against
all
known
OPC
.

In
this
article
,
we
review
data
on
structure-activity
relationship
of
pyridinium
oximes
and
discuss
their
pharmacological
and
toxicological
significance

,
unrelated
to

antiepileptic
agents
,
with
activity
in
a
broad
range
of

In
the
present
study
,
we
sought
to
determine
whether
retigabine
could
enhance

In

,
retigabine
enhanced

.

The
effect
of
retigabine
was
associated
with
a
slowing
of

current
deactivation
in

Retigabine

Our

PURPOSE
:
Chemotherapy
regimens
based
on
anthracycline
(
doxorubicin
)
are
well
established
in
lymphoma
therapy
.

The
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
examine
the
effects
of
L-carnitine
with
a
view
to
reducing
cytotoxic
side-effects
.

METHODS
:
20
patients
were
scheduled
to
receive
3
g
L-carnitine
before
each
chemotherapy
cycle
,
followed
by
1
g
L-carnitine
/
day
during
the
following
21
days
,
while
20
patients
received
a
placebo
(
randomized
controlled
trial
)
.

The
plasma
lipid
profile
and
relative
mRNA
levels
of
key
enzymes
of
oxidative
metabolism
(
carnitine
acyltransferases
)
were
measured
at
three
points
of
time
.

In
addition
to
the
clinical
parameters
we
used
the
mRNA
of
white
blood
cells
to
evaluate
the
toxic
effects
on
cardiomyocytes
.

RESULTS
:
In
the
present
study
no
cardiotoxicity
of
anthracycline
therapy
was
detected
.

Carnitine
treated
patients
showed
a
rise
in
plasma
carnitine
which
led
to
an
increase
of
relative
mRNA
levels
from
CPT1A
(
liver
isoform
of
carnitine
palmitoyltransferase
)
and
OCTN2
(
carnitine
transporter
)
.

Following
chemotherapy
,
an
activation
of
carnitine
acyltransferases
was
associated
with
a
stimulation
of
OCTN2
in
both
groups
.

CONCLUSION
:
Biochemical
and
molecular
analyses
indicated
a
stimulation
of
oxidative
metabolism
in
white
blood
cells
through
carnitine
uptake
.

TCDD
exposure
has
various
toxic
effects
on
in
the
human
nervous
system
resulting
in
various
developmental
and
behavioral
deficits
.

However
the
underlying
molecular
mechanism
of
TCDD-induced
adverse
effects
on
the
CNS
and
associated
signaling
pathways
remains
largely
unknown
.

Herein
we
analyzed
acute
TCDD
exposure
in
the
rat
brain
cortex
to
investigate
whether
misregulation
of
the
Wnt
/
β-catenin
signaling
pathway
plays
a
role
in
neurotoxicity
.

Western
blot
and
immunohistochemical
experiments
revealed
a
significant
down-regulation
of
β-catenin
and
phospho-glycogen
synthase
kinase-3β
(
pSer9-GSK-3β
)
after
TCDD
exposure
.

TUNEL
assay
results
showed
apoptosis
occurs
mainly
at
day
7
after
TCDD
treatment
.

Immunofluorescent
labeling
indicated
that
β-catenin
was
localized
mainly
in
the
neurons;
co-localization
of
β-catenin
and
active
caspase-3
was
found
following
TCDD
exposure
.

Further
,
TCDD
exposure
decreased
the
level
of
pSer9-GSK-3β
and
β-catenin
,
and
increased
apoptosis
in
the
PC12
neuronal
cell
line
in
a
dose-dependent
manner
.

Interestingly
the
application
of
lithium
chloride
,
a
GSK-3β
inhibitor
,
reversed
the
suppressive
effect
of
TCDD
on
β-catenin
in
PC12
cells
and
primary
cortical
neurons
restoring
cell
viability
and
protecting
cells
from
apoptosis
as
compared
to
untreated
controls
.

Taken
together
,
these
results
indicate
that
the
canonical
Wnt
/
β-catenin
signaling
pathway
may
play
an
important
role
in
TCDD-induced
neurotoxicity
and
neuronal
apoptosis
.
OBJECTIVEChronic

to
calcineurin

poses
renal
transplant
recipients
(
RTR
)
at
high
risk
for
development
of
new-onset
diabetes

)
.

Pancreatic
β-cell
dysfunction
may
be
crucial
to
the
pathophysiology
of
NODAT
and
specific
markers
for
β-cell
dysfunction
may
have
additive
value
for
predicting
NODAT
in
this
population
.

Therefore
,
we
prospectively
investigated
whether
proinsulin
,
as
a
marker
of
pancreatic
β-cell
dysfunction
,
is
associated
with
future
development
of
NODAT
and
improves

of
it
.

7-Angstrom
molecular
structure
of
human
microsomal
cytochrome
P450
2C8
(
CYP2C8
)
was
determined
by
x-ray
crystallography
.

The
membrane
protein
was
modified
for
crystallization
by
replacement
of
the
hydrophobic
N-terminal
transmembrane
domain
with
a
short
hydrophilic
sequence
before
residue
28
.

The
structure
of
the
native
sequence
is
complete
from
residue
28
to
the
beginning
of
a
C-terminal
histidine
tag
used
for
purification
.

CYP2C8
is
one
of
the
principal
hepatic
drug-metabolizing
enzymes
that
oxidizes
therapeutic
drugs
such
as
taxol
and
cerivastatin
and
endobiotics
such
as
retinoic
acid
and
arachidonic
acid
.

Consistent
with
the
relatively
large
size
of
its
preferred
substrates
,
the
active
site
volume
is
twice
that
observed
for
the
structure
of
CYP2C5
.

The
extended
active
site
cavity
is
bounded
by
the
beta1
sheet
and
helix
F'
that
have
not
previously
been
implicated
in
substrate
recognition
by
mammalian
P450s
.

CYP2C8
crystallized
as
a
symmetric
dimer
formed
by
the
interaction
of
helices
F
,
F'
,
G'
,
and
G
.

Two
molecules
of
palmitic
acid
are
bound
in
the

.

The
dimer
is
observed
in
solution
,
and
mass
spectrometry
confirmed
the
association
of
palmitic
acid
with
the
enzyme
.

This
novel
finding
identifies
a
peripheral

in
P450s
that
may
contribute
to
drug-drug

One
of
the
difficulties
in
application
of
the
usual
reference
interaction
site
model
self-consistent
field
(
RISM-SCF
)
method
to
a
highly
polarized
and
bulky
system
arises
from
the
approximate
evaluation
of
electrostatic
potential
(
ESP
)
with
pure
point
charges
.

To
improve
this
ESP
evaluation
,
the
ESP
near
a
solute
is
directly
calculated
with
a
solute
electronic
wavefunction
,
that
distant
from
a
solute
is
approximately
calculated
with
solute
point
charges
,
and
they
are
connected
with
a
switching
function
.

To
evaluate
the
fine
solvation
structure
near
the
solute
by
incorporating
the
long-range
solute-solvent
Coulombic
interaction
with
low
computational
cost
,
we
introduced
the
dual
solvent
box
protocol;
one
small
box
with
the
fine
spacing
is
employed
for
the
first
and
the
second
solvation
shells
and
the
other
large
box
with
the
normal
spacing
is
employed
for
long-range
solute-solvent
interaction
.

The
levoglucosan
formation
from
phenyl
α-
and
β-d-glucosides
under
basic
conditions
is
successfully
inspected
by
this
3D-RISM-SCF
method
at
the
MP2
and
SCS-MP2
levels
,
though
the
1D-RISM-SCF
could
not
be
applied
to
this
reaction
due
to
the
presence
of
highly
polarized
and
bulky
species
.

This
3D-RISM-SCF
calculation
reproduces
the
experimentally
reported
higher
reactivity
of
the
β-anomer
.

The
3D-RISM-SCF-calculated
activation
free
energy
for
the
β-anomer
is
closer
to
the
experimental
value
than
the
PCM-calculated
one
.

Interestingly
,
the
solvation
effect
increases
the
difference
in
reactivity
between
these
two
anomers
.

The
reason
is
successfully
elucidated
with
3D-RISM-SCF-calculated
microscopic
solvation
structure
and
decomposition
analysis
of
solute-solvent
interaction

Inhibition
of
D-amino
acid
oxidase
(
DAAO
)
activity
is
a
potential
target
for
the
treatment
of
chronic
pain
.

Here
we
characterized
the
effects
of
systemic
administration
of
the
DAAO
inhibitor
4H-furo
[
3
,
2-b
]
pyrrole-5-carboxylic
acid
(
SUN
)
in
rat
models
of
neuropathic
and
inflammatory
pain
.

Oral
administration
of
SUN
dose-dependently
attenuated
tactile
allodynia
induced
by
ligation
of
the
L5
spinal
nerve
(
SNL
)
,
and
similarly
reversed
thermal
hyperalgesia
produced
by
chronic
constriction
injury
(
CCI
)
.

In
addition
,
SUN
was
efficacious
against
Complete
Freund's
Adjuvant
(
CFA
)
-induced
thermal
hyperalgesia
.

In
these
models
,
maximal
reversal
of
pain-related
behaviors
corresponded
with
maximum
rates-of-increase
in
brain
and
plasma
D-serine
concentrations
,
indicative
of
full
inhibition
of
DAAO
activity
.

To
investigate
the
possible
site
(
s
)
of
action
,
we
recorded
spontaneous
nerve
activity
and
mechanically-evoked
responses
of
central
spinal
cord
dorsal
horn
neurons
and
compared
these
to
spontaneous
activity
of
peripheral
dorsal
root
filaments
in
anesthetized
SNL
model
animals
.

Oral
SUN
reduced
spontaneous
activity
in
both
central
and
peripheral
recordings
at
doses
and
pretreatment
times
that
corresponded
to
reduced
mechanical
allodynia
in
behavioral
experiments
.

Following
i
.

v
.

administration
of
SUN
,
the
onset
of
action
for
this
central
effect
was
rapid
(
maximal
effects
within
30
minutes
)
,
but
was
abolished
by
severing
afferent
inputs
to
the
dorsal
horn
.

Overall
,
these
results
indicate
that
inhibition
of
DAAO
in
peripheral
afferent-spinal
circuits
reduced
spontaneous
neuronal
activity
to
attenuate
pain-related
behaviors
in
rat
models
of
neuropathic
and
inflammatory
pain
.

)
activates
colonic
splanchnic
afferents
,
a
mechanism
by
which
it
has
been
implicated
in
generating
symptoms
in
postinfectious
and
postinflammatory
states
in
humans
.

Here
we
compared
mechanisms
of
colonic
afferent
activation
by
5-HT
and
mechanical
stimuli
in
normal
and
inflamed
rat
colon
,
and
after
recovery
from
inflammation
.

Colonic
inflammation
was
induced
in
rats
by
dextran
sulphate
sodium
.

Single-fibre
recordings
of
colonic
lumbar
splanchnic
afferents
revealed
that
58%
of
endings
responded
to
5-HT
(
10
(
-4
)
m
)
in
controls
,
88%
in
acute
inflammation
(
P<0
.
05
)
and
75%
after
21
days
recovery
(
P
<
0
.
05
versus
control
)
.

Maximal
responses
to
5-HT
were
also
larger
,
and
the
estimated
EC50
was
reduced
from
3
.
2
x
10
(
-6
)
to
8
x
10
(
-7
)
m
in
acute
inflammation
and
recovered
to
2
x
10
(
-6
)
m
after
recovery
.

Responsiveness
to
mechanical
stimulation
was
unaffected
.

5-HT3
receptor
antagonism
with
alosetron
reduced
responses
to
5-HT
in
controls
but
not
during
inflammation
.

Responses
to
the
mast
cell
degranulator
48
/
80
mimicked
those
to
5-HT
in
inflamed
tissue
but
not
in
controls
,
and
more
5-HT-containing
mast
cells
were
seen
close
to
calcitonin
gene-related
peptide-containing
fibres
in
inflamed
serosa
.

We
conclude
that
colonic
serosal
and
mesenteric
endings
exhibit
increased
sensitivity
to
5-HT
in
inflammation
,
with
both
an
increase
in
proportion
of
responders
and
an
increase
in
sensitivity
,
which
is
maintained
after
healing
of
inflammation
.

This
is
associated
with
alterations
in
the
roles
of
5-HT3
receptors
and
mast
cells
.
Eosinophilia
may
be
associated
with
reactive
conditions
and
with
clonal
disorders
of
the
hematopoietic
cells
.

The
hypereosinophilic
syndrome
takes
an
intermedier
place
in
this
group
.

In
this
disease
a
sustained
eosinophilia
with
end
organ
damage
can
occur
.

The
author
summarized
the
diagnostic
procedures
and
differential
diagnosis
in
the
group
of
these
diseases
focusing
on
characteristics
and
treatment
of
hypereosinophilic
syndrome
.

The
treatment
has
been
varied
and
included
steroids
,
hydroxyurea
,
interferon-alpha
,
and
in
some
cases
chemotherapy
.

On
the
basis
of
FIP1L1-PDGFRa
fusion
gene
hypereosinophilic
syndrome
would
be
classified
as
a
clonal
disease
and
in
the
FIP1L1-PDGFRa
positive
cases
the
tyrosine
kinase
inhibitor
imatinib
mesylate
(
Glivec
)
would
be
effective
.
Cognitive
deficit
is
a
core
of
schizophrenia
and
it
is
not
effectively
treated
by
the
available
antipsychotic
drugs
,
hence
new
and
more
effective
therapy
is
needed
.

Schizophrenia
is
considered
as
a
pathway
disorder
where
Disrupted-In-Schizophrenia-1
(
DISC1
)
is
important
molecular
player
that
regulates
multiple
cellular
cascades
.

We
recently
reported
synergistic
action
between
phosphodiesterase-4
(
PDE4
)
and
glycogen
synthase
kinase-3
(
GSK-3
)
as
DISC1
interacting
proteins
.

In
the
current
study
we
characterized
behavioural
effects
of
a
newly
developed
compound
,
VP1
.
15
that
inhibits
both
PDE7
and
GSK-3
with
main
focus
on
its
antipsychotic
and
cognitive
capacities
.

VP1

C57BL

in
a
dose-dependent
manner
(

5
mg
/
kg
and
3
mg
/
kg
,
respectively
)
and
,
hence
,
lower
dose
was
chosen
for
the
further
analysis
.

VP1

facilitated
pre-pulse
inhibition
(
PPI
)
,
reversed
amphetamine-

MK-801-induced

The
drug
was
able
to
ameliorate
the
disrupted
latent
inhibition
(
LI
)
induced
by
the
increased
number
of
conditioning
trials
and
reversed
amphetamine-induced
LI
deficit
,
supporting
further
its
antipsychotic
effects
.

The
drug
also
significantly
improved
episodic
memory
in
the
spatial
object
recognition
test
,
facilitated
working
memory
in
Y-maze
and
enhanced
cued
fear
memory
,
but
had
no
effect
on
executive
function
in
the
Puzzle
box
and
contextual
fear
conditioning
.

Taken
together
,
VP1
.
15
elicited
antipsychotic
effects
and
also
facilitated
cognitive
domains
in
mice
,
suggesting
that
multitarget
drugs
,
affecting
molecular
substrates
from
the
same
pathway
,
perhaps
could
be
antipsychotics
of
new-generation
that
open
a
new
possibilities
in
drug
discoveries
.

Stimulation
of
Calu-3
epithelia
with
7
,
8-benzoquinoline
,
under
short
circuit
current
conditions
,
produced
a
current
increase
that
was
completely
accounted
for
by
the
net
flux
of
chloride
,
measured
simultaneously
with
36Cl-
.

Nevertheless
the
current
stimulated
by
7
,
8-benzoquinoline
was
sensitive
to
acetazolamide
,
which
caused
up
to
50
%
inhibition
of
the
stimulated
current
,
the
remainder
being
sensitive
to
the
Na
+
-K
+
-2Cl-
cotransport
inhibitor
bumetanide
.

The
effects
of
acetazolamide
could
be
mimicked
by
either
amiloride
or
by
the
di-sodium
salt
of
4
,
4'-dinitrostilbene-2
,
2'-disulphonic
acid
(
DNDS
)
added
to
the
basolateral
side
of
the
epithelium
,
but
their
actions
were
not
additive
.

Amiloride
was
needed
in
sufficient
concentration
to
inhibit
the
sodium-proton
exchanger
NHE1
.

DNDS
blocks
both
the
chloride-bicarbonate
exchanger
AE2
and
the
sodium-bicarbonate
transporter
NBC1
.

However
,
since
7
,
8-benzoquinoline
activates
basolateral
K
+
channels
,
causing
hyperpolarisation
,
it
is
unlikely
NBC1
is
active
after
addition
of
7
,
8-benzoquinoline
.

The
effect
of
DNDS
is
,
therefore
,
mainly
on
AE2
.

It
is
concluded
that
chloride
enters
the
basolateral
aspect
of
the
cells
using
the
Na
+
-K
+
-2Cl-
cotransporter
and
a
parallel
arrangement
of
NHE1
with
AE2
,
these
latter
two
being
sensitive
to
acetazolamide
because
of
their
association
with
the
cytoplasmic
form
of
carbonic
anhydrase
CAII
.

The
effects
of
acetazolamide
could
be
mimicked
by
removal
of
HCO3-
/
CO2
from
the
bathing
medium
,
and
furthermore
showed
that
the
NHE1-AE2
mechanism
is
particularly
important
when
the
transport
rate
is
high
.

Thus
part
of
the
current
stimulated
by
7
,
8-benzoquinoline
and
inhibited
by
acetazolamide
or
HCO3-
/
CO2
removal
can
be
said
to
represent
bicarbonate-dependent
chloride
secretion
.

Brief
strong
depolarization
of
cerebellar
Purkinje
cells
produces
a
slow
inward
cation
current
.

This
current
,
called
depolarization-induced
slow
current
(
DISC
)
,
is
triggered
by
Ca
influx
in
the
Purkinje
cell
and
is
attenuated
by
a
blocker
of
vesicular
fusion
.

Previous
work
in
other
brain
regions
,
such
as
the
substantia
nigra
and
ventral
tegmental
area
,
has
shown
that
dopamine
can
be
released
from
dendrites
to
produce
paracrine
and
autocrine
signaling
.

Here
,
we
test
the
hypothesis
that
postsynaptic
release
of
dopamine
and
autocrine
activation
of
dopamine
receptors
is
involved
in
DISC
.

Light
immunohistochemistry
showed
that
D
(
3
)
dopamine
receptors
,
vesicular
monoamine
transporter
type
2
(
VMAT2
)
,
and
dopamine
plasma
membrane
transporters
(
DATs
)
were
all
expressed
in
cerebellar
Purkinje
cells
.

However
,
their
expression
was
strongest
in
the
gyrus
region
of
cerebellar
lobules
IX
and
X
.

Comparison
of
DISC
across
lobules
revealed
that
it
was
weak
in
the
anterior
portions
of
the
cerebellum
(
lobules
II
,
V
,
and
VI
)
and
strong
in
lobules
IX
and
X
.

DISC
was
blocked
by
dopamine
receptor
antagonists
(
haloperidol
,
clozapine
,
eticlopride
,
and
SCH23390
)
.

Likewise
,
DISC
was
strongly
attenuated
by
inhibitors
of
VMAT
(
reserpine
and
tetrabenazine
)
and
DAT
(
GBR12909
and
rimcazole
)
.

These
drugs
did
not
produce
DISC
attenuation
through
blockade
of
depolarization-evoked
Purkinje
cell
Ca
transients
.

Purkinje
cells
in
cerebellar
slices
derived
from
DAT-null
mice
expressed
DISC
,
but
this
DISC
ran
down
at
a
significantly
higher
rate
than
littermate
controls
.

Together
,
these
results
suggest
that
strong
Purkinje
cell
depolarization
produces
Ca-dependent
release
of
vesicular
postsynaptic
dopamine
that
then
excites
Purkinje
cells
in
an
autocrine
manner
.
Vitamin
A
and
its
derivatives
regulate
a
broad
array
of
immune
functions
.

The
effects
of
these
retinoids
are
mediated
through
members
of
retinoic
acid
receptors
(
RARs
)
and
retinoid
X
receptors
.

However
,
the
role
of
individual
retinoid
receptors
in
the
pleiotropic
effects
of
retinoids
remains
unclear
.

To
dissect
the
role
of
these
receptors
in
the
immune
system
,
we
analyzed
immune
cell
development
and
function
in
mice
conditionally
lacking
RARgamma
,
the
third
member
of
the
RAR
family
.

We
show
that
RARgamma
is
dispensable
for
T
and
B
lymphocyte
development
,
the
humoral
immune
response
to
a
T-dependent
Ag
and
in
vitro
Th
cell
differentiation
.

However
,
RARgamma-deficient
mice
had
a
defective
primary
and
memory
CD8
(
+
)
T
cell
response
to
Listeria
monocytogenes
infection
.

Unexpectedly
,
RARgamma-deficient
macrophages
exhibited
impaired
inflammatory
cytokine
production
upon
TLR
stimulation
.

These
results
suggest
that
under
physiological
condition
,
RARgamma
is
a
positive
regulator
of
inflammatory
cytokine
production
.
A
series
of
permanently
charged
ammonium
and
sulfonium
analogues
of
metoclopramide
as
well
as
a
permanently
uncharged
sulfide
analogue
were
synthesized
and
evaluated
for
their
ability
to
inhibit
apomorphine-induced
responses
on
mouse
striatal
slices
.

Three
of
the
four
permanently
charged
analogues
were
found
to
inhibit
apomorphine's
effects
,
although
at
higher
concentrations
than
either
metoclopramide
or
its
dimethyl
analogue
.

In
contrast
,
the
sulfide
analogue
was
inactive
at
concentrations
up
to
100
microM
.

These
findings
are
consistent
with
earlier
studies
of
chlorpromazine
and
sulpiride
analogues
and
provide
further
evidence
that
dopamine
antagonists
bind
in
their
charged
molecular
forms
to
anionic
sites
on
the
D2
receptor
.

Further
,
the
results
of
this
study
in
conjunction
with
those
of
our
earlier
sulpiride
study
would
seem
to
indicate
that
differences
in
the
biological
profiles
of
metoclopramide
,
a
type
1
benzamide
useful
as
a
gastric
prokinetic
agent
,
and
sulpiride
,
a
type
2
benzamide
useful
for
its
antipsychotic
effects
,
are
not
due
to
any
appreciable
differences
in
the
binding
of
the
basic
nitrogen
atom
of
these
molecules
.
Medulloblastoma
(
MB
)
is
the
most
common
malignant
neuroepithelial
tumor
of
childhood
.

The
DNA
topoisomerase
II
(
Topo
II
)
inhibitor
etoposide
has
been
widely
used
for
the
treatment
of
MBs;
however
,
it
remains
unknown
whether
MB
cells
are
more
sensitive
to
etoposide
than
other
malignant
neuroepithelial
tumor
cells
.

In
this
study
,
we
tested
the
chemosensitivities
of
malignant
neuroepithelial
tumors
(
26
glioblastomas
,
9
anaplastic
astrocytomas
,
and
5
MBs
)
to
etoposide
and
vincristine
using
the
succinate
dehydrogenase
inhibition
test
and
found
that
MB
cells
are
more
sensitive
to
etoposide
and
more
resistant
to
vincristine
than
other
tumor
cells
.

We
performed
quantitative
reverse-transcription
polymerase
chain
reaction
to
evaluate
the
expression
of
genes
related
to
etoposide
sensitivity
,
and
found
co-overexpression
of
DNA
topoisomerase
II
(
Topo
II
)
alpha
and
beta
mRNA
in
MBs
.

In
addition
,
the
levels
of
Topo
IIalpha
and
beta
mRNA
in
these
tumors
correlated
with
etoposide
sensitivity
.

Immunohistochemical
studies
using
surgical
samples
of
these
tumors
demonstrated
that
the
percentages
of
Topo
IIalpha
immunopositive
cells
(
Topo
IIalpha
labeling
index
)
correlated
with
those
of
Ki-67
immunopositive
cells
(
MIB-1
labeling
index
)
;
however
,
neither
the
Topo
IIalpha
nor
the
MIB-1
labeling
index
correlated
with
the
levels
of
Topo
IIalpha
mRNA
or
etoposide
sensitivity
.

Based
on
these
observations
,
Topo
IIalpha
and
beta
mRNA
expression
,
but
not
the
Topo
IIalpha
labeling
index
,
might
be
a
useful
marker
for
sensitivity
to
etoposide
in
human
malignant
neuroepithelial
tumors
.

To
examine
whether
a
similar
relationship
occurs
in
vivo
,
hepatic
BHMT
expression
was
induced
by
feeding
rats
a
Met
(
L-methionine
)
-restricted
betaine-containing
diet
,
and
parameters
of
ApoB
metabolism
were
evaluated
.

There
were
no
generalized
metabolic
abnormalities
associated
with
Met
restriction
for
7
days
,
as
evidenced
by
control
levels
of
serum
glucose
,
ketones
,
alanine
aminotransferase
and
L-homocysteine
levels
.

Betaine
plus
the
Met
restriction
resulted
in
lower
serum
insulin
and
non-esterified
fatty
acid
levels
.

Betaine
plus
Met
restriction
induced
hepatic
BHMT
4-fold
and
ApoB
mRNA
3-fold
compared
with
Met
restriction
alone
.

No
changes
in
percentage
of
edited
ApoB
mRNA
were
observed
on
the
test
diets
.

An
increase
in
liver
ApoB
mRNA
correlated
with
an
82%
and
46%
increase
in
ApoB
and
triacylglycerol
production
respectively
using
in
vivo
Triton
WR
1339
.

Increased
secretion
of
VLDL
(
very-low-density
lipoprotein
)
with
Met
restriction
plus
betaine
was
associated
with
a
45%
reduction
in
liver
triacylglycerol
compared
with
control
.

Nuclear
run-off
assays
established
that
transcription
of
both
bhmt
and
apob
genes
was
also
increased
in
Met-restricted
plus
betaine
diets
.

No
change
in
ApoB
mRNA
stability
was
detected
in
BHMT-transfected
McA
cells
.

Hepatic
ApoB
and
BHMT
mRNA
levels
were
also
increased
by
1
.
8-
and
3-fold
respectively
by
betaine
supplementation
of
Met-replete
diets
.

Since
dietary
betaine
increased
ApoB
mRNA
,
VLDL
ApoB
and
triacylglycerol
production
and
decreased
hepatic
triacylglycerol
,
results
suggest
that
induction
of
apob
transcription
may
provide
a
potential
mechanism
for
mobilizing
hepatic
triacylglycerol
by
increasing
ApoB
available
for
VLDL
assembly
and
secretion
.

have
been
linked
to
autoimmune

The

of
CDO
from
Mus

was
solved
to

75
Angstroms
.

The
sequence
is
91%
identical
to
that
of
a

The
structure
reveals
that
CDO
adopts
the
typical
beta-barrel
fold
of
the
cupin
superfamily
.

The
NE2
atoms
of
His-86
,

,
and

provide
the
metal

The
structure
further
revealed
a

linkage
between
the
side
chains
of
Cys-93
and
Tyr-157
,
the
cysteine
of

Ovarian
cancer
is
the
most
lethal
gynecological
malignancy
,
characterized
by
a
high
rate
of
chemoresistance
.

Current
treatment
strategies
for
ovarian
cancer
focus
on
novel
drug
combinations
of
cytotoxic
agents
and
molecular
targeted
agents
or
novel
drug
delivery
strategies
that
often
involve
intraperitoneal
(
IP
)
injection
.

Poly
(
ethylene
glycol
)
-block-poly
(
ε-caprolactone
)
(
PEG-b-PCL
)
micelles
were
loaded
with
paclitaxel
(
cytotoxic
agent
)
,
cyclopamine
(
hedgehog
inhibitor
)
,
and
gossypol
(
Bcl-2
inhibitor
)
.

After
physicochemical
studies
focusing
on
combination
drug
solubilization
,
3-drug
PEG-b-PCL
micelles
were
evaluated
in
vitro
in
2-D
and
3-D
cell
culture
and
in
vivo
in
xenograft
models
of
ovarian
cancer
,
tracking
bioluminescence
signals
from
ES-2
and
SKOV3
human
ovarian
cancer
cell
lines
after
IP
injection
.

3-Drug
PEG-b-PCL
micelles
were
not
significantly
more
potent
in
2-D
cell
culture
in
comparison
to
paclitaxel;
however
,
they
disaggregated
ES-2
tumor
spheroids
,
whereas
single
drugs
or
2-drug
combinations
only
slowed
growth
of
ES-2
tumor
spheroids
or
had
no
noticeable
effects
.

In
ES-2
and
SKOV3
xenograft
models
,
3-drug
PEG-b-PCL
micelles
had
significantly
less
tumor
burden
than
paclitaxel
based
on
bioluminescence
imaging
,
3'-deoxy-3'-

)
F-fluorothymidine

imaging
,
and
overall
survival
.

(

)
F-FLT-PET
images
clearly
showed
that
3-drug
PEG-b-PCL
micelles
dramatically
reduce
tumor
volumes
over
paclitaxel
and
vehicle
controls
.

In
summary
,
PEG-b-PCL
micelles
enable
the
IP
combination
drug
delivery
of
paclitaxel
,
cyclopamine
and
gossypol
,
resulting
in
tumor
growth
inhibition
and
prolonged
survival
over
paclitaxel
alone
.

These
results
validate
a
novel
treatment
strategy
for
ovarian
cancer
based
on
drug
combinations
of
cytotoxic

and

Three
compounds
are
in
clinical
use
:
abciximab
,
an
antibody
fragment
and
two
low-molecular
weight
compounds
,
tirofiban
and
eptifibatide
.

In
comparison
to
the
low-molecular
weight
compounds
,
abciximab
has
a
substantially
longer
platelet
half-life
(
4
h
)
,

off-rate
and
a
short
plasma
half-life
(
20-30
min
)
without
significant
distribution
into
the
extravascular
space
.

The
plasma
half-life
of
tirofiban
and
eptifibatide
is
about
2
h
and
parallels
the
antiplatelet
effect
.

The
off-rate
from
the
platelet
GP
IIb
/
IIIa
receptor
is
much
faster
and
there
is
a
significant
distribution
into
the
extravascular
space
.

These
pharmacokinetic
variables
might
influence
the
competition
between
the
antagonists
and
fibrinogen
for
GP
IIb
/
IIIa
binding
.

Other
pharmacological
variables
are
a
partial
agonistic
activity
,
facilitation
of
thrombolysis
,
modification
of
other
integrin-related
actions
,
including
inflammatory
responses
,
effects
on
vascular
cells
and
apoptosis
.

Importantly
,
GP
IIb
/
IIIa
antagonists
might
also
interfere
with
prothrombin
binding
to
the
platelet
surface
and
,
thus
,
might
influence
the
coagulation
pathway
.

There
is
no
clear
evidence
that
the
biological
activity
of
the
agents
is
modified
by
gene
polymorphism
(
HPA-1
)
.

All
three
compounds
may
cause
thrombocytopenia
,
possibly
related
to
drug-induced
antibodies
.

There
is
no
clear
data
suggesting
that
these
pharmacological
differences
transfer
into
significant
differences
in
clinical
outcome
,
for
example
in
patients
with
acute
coronary
syndromes
(
ACS
)
subjected
to
acute
percutaneous
coronary
interventions
(
PCI
)
.

The
only
head-to-head
comparison
of
all
three
clinically
used
parenteral
compounds
did
not
demonstrate
differences
in
major
adverse
cardiac
effects
(
MACE
)
at
30
days
although
those
have
been
described
in
particular
with
long-term
use
of
oral
antagonists
.

The
inherent
problems
with
all
GP
IIb
/
IIIa
antagonists
are
the
narrow
therapeutic
range
because
the
same
mechanisms
are
involved
in
hemostasis
and
thrombosis
and
their
inability

The

and
its

is
higher

that

Moreover
,
SCPP11
could
ameliorate
the
hematological

biochemical
parameters

no
significant
changes
in

could
increase

In

could
also
increased

ion
channels
,
is
specifically
induced
in
the
livers
of
male
mice
after

treatment

Here
,
we
have
determined
the
molecular
mechanism
of
this
male-specific
activation
of
the
Kcnk1
gene
and
characterized
KCNK1
as
a
phenobarbital-inducible
antihyperplasia
factor
.

Upon
activation
by
phenobarbital
,
nuclear
receptor
CAR
binds
the
97-bp
response
element
(
-2441
/
-2345
)
within
the
Kcnk1
promoter
.

This
binding
is
observed
in
the
livers
of
male
mice
,
but
not
in
the
livers
of
female
mice
and
requires
the
pituitary
gland
,
because
hypophysectomy
abrogates
it
.

Hyperplasia

)
male
mice
compared
with
those
of
Kcnk1
(

/
+
)
males
after
phenobarbital
treatment
.

Thus
,
KCNK1
suppresses
phenobarbital-induced
hyperplasia
.

These
results
indicate
that
phenobarbital
treatment
induces
KCNK1
to
elicit
a
male-specific
and
growth-suppressing
signal
.

Thus
,
KCNK1
and
Kcnk1
(

mice
provide
an
experimental
tool
for
further
investigation
into
the

Tris
(

phosphate
(
TDCPP
)
has
been
frequently
detected
in
the
environment
and
in
various
biota
,
including
fish
,
and
has
been
implicated
in
disruption
of
the
thyroid
endocrine
system
.

In
the
present
study
,
zebrafish
(
Danio
rerio
)
embryos
were
exposed
to
different
concentrations
of
TDCPP
(
10
,
50
,
100
,
300
and

whole-body
concentrations
of
thyroid
hormones
and
transcriptional
profiles
of
genes
involved
in
the
hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid
(
HPT
)
axis
were
examined
.

Exposure
to
TDCPP
caused
a
dose-dependent
developmental
toxicity
,
including
decreased
body
weight
,
reduced
hatching
,
survival
and
heartbeat
rates
,
and
increased
malformation
(
spinal

)
.

Treatment
with
the
positive
control
chemical
3
,
3'
,
5-triiodo-l-thyronine
(
T3
)
significantly
decreased
whole-body
thyroxin
(
T4
)
concentrations
,
increased
whole-body
T3
concentrations
,
and
upregulated
mRNA
expression
involved
in
the
HPT
axis
as
a
compensatory
mechanism
.

These
results
suggested
that
the
HPT
axis
in
144-hpf
zebrafish
larvae
was
responsive
to
chemical
exposure
and
could
be
used
to
evaluate
the
effects
of
chemicals
on
the
thyroid
endocrine
system
.

TDCPP
exposure
significantly
decreased
whole-body
T4
concentrations
and
increased
whole-body
T3
concentrations
,
indicating
thyroid
endocrine
disruption
.

The
upregulation
of
genes
related
to
thyroid
hormone
metabolism
(
dio1
and
ugt1ab
)
might
be
responsible
for
decreased
T4
concentrations
.

Treatment
with
TDCPP
also
significantly
increased
transcription
of
genes
involved
in
thyroid
hormone
synthesis
(
tshβ
,
slc5a5
and

)
and
thyroid
development
(
hhex
,
nkx2
.
1
and
pax8
)
as
a
compensatory
mechanism
for
decreased
T4
concentrations
.

Taken
together
,
these
results
suggest
that
TDCPP
alters
the
transcription
of
genes
involved
in
the
HPT
axis
and
changes
whole-body
concentrations
of
thyroid
hormones
in
zebrafish
embryos

,
thus
causing
an
endocrine
disruption

inhibitor
induced

injury
at
exposures
representing
less
than
4
times
the
anticipated
efficacious
exposure
in
man
during
a
7-day
toxicity
study
in
rats
.

The
findings
consisted
mainly
of
tubular
lesions
and
the
presence
of
crystalline
material
and
increases
in
plasma
urea
and
creatinine
.

In
vitro
and
in
vivo
metabolic
profiling
generated
a
working
hypothesis
that
a
bis-sulfonamide
metabolite
(
determined
M1
)
formed
by
amide
hydrolysis
caused
this
toxicity
.

To
test
this
hypothesis
,
rats
were
subjected
to
a
7-day
study
and
were
administered
the
suspected
metabolite
and
two
low-potency
mPGES-1
inhibitor
analogs
,
where
amide
hydrolysis
was
undetectable
in
rat
hepatocyte
experiments
.

The
results
suggested
that
compounds
with
a
reduced
propensity
to
undergo
amide
hydrolysis
,
thus
having
less
ability
to
form
M1
,
reduced
the
risk
of
inducing
kidney
toxicity
.

Rats
treated
with
M1
alone
showed
no
histopathologic
change
in
the
kidney
,
which
was
likely
related
to
underexposure
to
M1
.

To
circumvent
rat
kidney
toxicity
,
we
identified
a
potent
mPGES-1
inhibitor
with
a
low
propensity
for
amide
hydrolysis
and
superior
rat
pharmacokinetic
properties
.

A
subsequent
14-day
rat
toxicity
study
showed
that
this
compound
was
associated
with
kidney
toxicity
at
42
,
but
not
21
,
times
the
anticipated
efficacious
exposure

In

by

a

active
mPGES-1

,
a

The

We
found

enhanced

in
a

.

The
tcuPA-mediated

of
PAI-1
involves
post-transcriptional
control
involving
stabilization
of

mRNA
.

Inactivation
of
the

of
tcuPA
had
little

the

It
was
previously
reported
that
[

nitrendipine
binding
to

upon
the
presence
of

The

on
[

nitrendipine

in

cardiac
muscle
have
been

Treatment
of

muscle
and
cardiac
muscle
with
EDTA
reduced
specific
[
3H

nitrendipine
binding
by
70
to
95%
.

Microsomes
from

were
more
resistant
to

treatment
than
were
those
from
ileal
smooth
muscle
,
but
low
concentrations
of
Ca

(

produced
half-maximal
restoration
of
binding
in
both

In

to
the
activation
of
calmodulin-dependent
processes
,
the
ability
of
these
cations
to
restore
[
3H
]
nitrendipine
binding
did
not
correlate
linearly
with
ionic
radius
.

However
,
calmodulin
antagonists
were
found
to
inhibit
[
3H

nitrendipine
binding
with
the
order
of
potency
:
pimozide
greater

calmidazolium

)
greater
than
trifluoperazine
greater
than
chlorpromazine
greater
than

greater

sulfoxide
,
that
correlates
quite
well
with
the
potency
of
these
drugs
as
inhibitors
of
calmodulin-dependent
processes
.

The
results
suggest
that
calmodulin
antagonists
bind
to
a
protein
associated
with
the
[
3H

nitrendipine
binding
site
that
has
a
hydrophobic

that

Butyrylcholinesterase
(
BChE

is
the
leading
pretreatment
candidate
against
exposure
to
organophosphates
(
OPs
)
,
which
pose
an
ever
increasing
public
and
military
health
.

Since
respiratory
failure
is
the
primary
cause
of
death
following
acute
OP
poisoning
,
an
inhaled
BChE
therapeutic
could
prove
highly
efficacious
in
preventing
acute
toxicity
as
well
as
the
associated
delayed
neuropathy
.

To
address
this
,
studies
have
been
performed
in
mice
and
macaques
using
Chinese
Hamster
Ovary
cells
(
CHO
)
-derived
recombinant
(
r

BChE
delivered
by
the

,
to
examine
whether
the
deposition
of
both
macaque
(
Ma
)
and
human
(
Hu
)
rBChE
administered
as
aerosols
(
aer
)
favored
the
creation
and
retention
of
an
efficient
protective
"pulmonary

that
could
scavenge
incoming

OPs
in

thereby
preventing

and
inhibition
of
plasma
BChE
and

on
red
blood
cells
(
RBC-AChE
)
and

synapses
.

In
contrast
to
parenteral
delivery
of
rBChE
,
which
currently
requires
posttranslational
modification
for
good
plasma
stability
,
an
unmodified
aer-rBChE
pretreatment
given
1-40h

of

(

was
able
to
prevent

These
studies
are
the
first
to
show
protection
by
rBChE
against
a
pesticide
such
as

when
delivered
directly

In

hepatocytes

cadmium
(

decreased
the

of

N-
(
3-chloro-4
hydroxyphenyl
)
carbamate
(
4-hydroxychlorpropham
,
4-OHCIPC
)
and
4-nitrophenol
in
a
concentration-dependent
manner
.

In
contrast
,
in
native
rat
liver
microsomes
,
glucuronidation
of
4-OHCIPC
was
increased
by
cadmium
through
activation
of
microsomal
4-OHCIPC
glucuronosyl
transferase
.

In
addition
,
in
rat
microsome
incubations
,
the
net
amount
of
4-OHCIPC
glucuronide
was
also
indirectly
increased
by
cadmium
through
a
reduction
in
the
activity
of
beta-glucuronidase
.

As
the
effect
of
cadmium
on
the
activity
of
4-OHCIPC
glucuronosyl
transferase
could
not
account
for
the
decrease
in
glucuronide
formation
in
intact
hepatocytes
,
the
influence
of
cadmium
on
the
availability
of
UDP-glucuronic
acid
(
UDPGA
)
was
investigated
further
.

In
isolated
rat
hepatocytes
,
cadmium
depleted
the
UDPGA
content
in
a
dose-dependent
manner
without
a
change
in
the
UDP
glucose
(
UDPG
)
content
.

Cadmium
did
not
increase
the
breakdown
of
UDPGA
by
microsomal
UDPGA
pyrophosphatase
but
strongly
decreased
(
30-66%
)
the
synthesis
of
the
cofactor
in
the
cytosol
by
inhibiting
UDP-glucose
dehydrogenase
(
UDPGDH
)
.

Cadmium
(
10-50

was

However
,
in
the
liver
,
neither
the
NAD

NADH
ratio
nor
the
UDPG
content
was
significantly
changed
following
cadmium
treatment
.

Both
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
results
support
the
conclusion
that
in
intact
cells
the
reduction
in
overall
4-OHCIPC
glucuronidation
caused
by
cadmium
was
due
to
a
decrease
in
UDPGA
availability
which
results
from
the
inhibiting

of
cadmium
on

Heterocyclic
and
aromatic
amine
carcinogens
are
thought
to
lead
to
tumor
initiation
via
the
formation
of
DNA
adducts
,
and
bioactivation
to
arylhydroxylamine
metabolites
is
necessary
for
reactivity
with
DNA
.

Carcinogenic
arylhydroxylamine
metabolites
are
cleared
by
a
microsomal
,
NADH-dependent
,
oxygen-insensitive
reduction
pathway
in
humans
,
which
may
be
a
source
of
interindividual
variability
in
response
to
aromatic
amine
carcinogens
.

The
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
characterize
the
identity
of
this
reduction
pathway
in
human
liver
.

On
the
basis
of
our
findings
with
structurally
similar
arylhydroxylamine
metabolites
of
therapeutic
drugs
,
we
hypothesized
that
the
reductive
detoxification
of
arylhydroxylamine
carcinogens
was
catalyzed
by
NADH
cytochrome
b5
reductase
(
b5R
)
and
cytochrome
b5
(
cyt
b5
)
.

We
found
that
reduction
of
the
carcinogenic
hydroxylamines
of
the
aromatic
amine
4-aminobiphenyl
(
4-ABP;
found
in
cigarette
smoke
)
and
the
heterocyclic
amine
2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo
[
4
,
5-b
]
pyridine
(
PhIP;
found
in
grilled
meats
)
was
indeed
catalyzed
by
a
purified
system
containing
only
human
b5R
and
cyt
b5
.

Specific
activities
were
56-346-fold
higher
in
the
purified
system
as
compared
to
human
liver
microsomes
(
HLM
)
,
with
similar
Michaelis-Menten
constants
(
K
(
m
)
values
)
in
both
systems
.

The
stoichiometry
for
b5R
and
cyt
b5
that
yielded
the
highest
activity
in
the
purified
system
was
also
similar
to
that
found
in
native
HLM
(
approximately
1
:
8
to
1
:
10
)
.

Polyclonal
antisera
to
either
b5R
or
cyt
b5
significantly
inhibited
N-hydroxy-4-aminobiphenyl
(
NHOH-4-ABP
)
reduction
by
95
and
89%
,
respectively
,
and
immunoreactive
cyt
b5
protein
content
in
individual
HLM
was
significantly
correlated
with
individual
reduction
of
both
NHOH-4-ABP
and
N-hydroxy-PhIP
(
NHOH-PhIP
)
.

Finally
,
titration
of
HLM
into
the
purified
b5R
/
cyt
b5
system
did
not
enhance
the
efficiency
of
reduction
activity
.

We
conclude
that
b5R
and
cyt
b5
are
together
solely
capable
of
the
reduction
of
arylhydroxylamine
carcinogens
,
and
we
further
hypothesize
that
this
pathway
may
be
a
source
of
individual
variability
with
respect
to
cancer
susceptibility
following
4-ABP
or
PhIP
exposure

Cerebral
ischemia-induced
difference
in
sensitivity
to
depression
and
potential
therapeutics
in
rats
.
Hepatocellular
carcinoma
(
HCC
)
mostly
develops
in
patients
with
advanced
fibrosis;
however
,
the
mechanisms
of
interaction
between
a
genotoxic
insult
and
fibrogenesis
are
not
well
understood
.

This
study
tested
a
hypothesis
that
fibrosis
promotes
HCC
via
a
mechanism
that
involves
activation
of
liver
stem
cells
.

First
,
B6C3F1
mice
were
administered
diethylnitrosamine
(
DEN;
single
ip
injection
of
1mg
/
kg
at
14
days
of
age
)
.

Second

carbon
tetrachloride
(
CCl
(

)
;
0
.
2ml
/
kg
,
2
/
week
ip
starting
at
8
weeks
of
age
)
was
administered
for
9
or
14
weeks
to
develop
advanced
liver
fibrosis
.

In
animals
treated
with
DEN
as
neonates
,
presence
of
liver
fibrosis
led
to
more
than
doubling
(
to
100%
)
of
the
liver
tumor
incidence
as
early
as
5
months
of
age
.

This
effect
was
associated
with
activation
of
cells
with
progenitor
features
in
noncancerous
liver
tissue
,
including
markers
of
replicative
senescence
(
p16
)
,
oncofetal
transformation
(
Afp
,
H19
,
and
Bex1
)
,
and
increased
"stemness"
(
Prom1
and
Epcam
)
.

In
contrast
,
the
dose
of
DEN
used
did
not
modify
the
extent
of
liver
inflammation
,
fibrogenesis
,
oxidative
stress
,
proliferation
,
or
apoptosis
induced
by
subchronic
CCl
(
4
)
administration
.

This
study
demonstrates
the
potential
role
of
liver
stem-like
cells
in
the
mechanisms
of
chemical-induced
,
fibrosis-promoted
HCC
.

We
posit
that
the
combination
of
genotoxic
and
fibrogenic
insults
is
a
sensible
approach
to
model
liver
carcinogenesis
in
experimental
animals
.

These
results
may
contribute
to
identification
of
cirrhotic
patients
predisposed
to
HCC
by
analyzing
the
expression
of
hepatic
progenitor
cell
markers
in
the
noncancerous
liver
tissue
.
RATIONALE
:
It
is
well
established
that
alcohol
acutely
impairs
the
ability
to
inhibit
a
pre-potent
response
(
motor
impulsivity
)
,
but
its
effects
on
cognitive
impulsivity
,
including
temporal
(
delayed
gratification
)
and
reflection
(
decision
making
)
impulsivity
,
are
not
clear
.

An
important
factor
contributing
to
the
effects
of
alcohol
is
cognitive
expectancies
of
alcohol-related
outcomes
.

OBJECTIVES
:
The
current
study
investigated
the
effect
of
alcohol
,
and
alcohol
outcome
expectancies
,
on
subtypes
of
impulsivity
.

METHODS
:
Impulsivity
was
tested
using
the
Stop
Signal
,
the
Single
Key
Impulsivity
and
the
Information
Sampling
Task
for
motor
,
temporal
and
reflection
impulsivity
,
respectively
.

Participants
(
n
=
48
)
received
placebo
,
a
low
(
0
.
4
g
/
kg
)
or
high
dose
(
0
.
8
g
/
kg
)
of
alcohol
,
before
completing
the
impulsivity
measures
.

RESULTS
:
Motor
impulsivity
was
affected
by
alcohol
dose;
participants
receiving
a
high
dose
displayed
reduced
inhibitory
control
.

Reflection
impulsivity
was
affected
by
cognitive
alcohol
expectancies
,
but
not
by
alcohol
condition;
participants
expecting
greater
cognitive
and
behavioural
impairment
by
alcohol
exhibited
low
impulsivity
.

Temporal
impulsivity
was
not
affected
by
either
alcohol
dose
or
outcome
expectancies
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
These
data
suggest
that
the
effects
of
alcohol
on
the
subtypes
of
impulsivity
are
dissociable
.

Motor
impulsivity
is
sensitive
to
the
pharmacological
effects
of
alcohol
,
whereas
the
reflection
subtype
is
affected
by
cognitive
alcohol
expectancies
.

The
findings
have
implications
for
the
understanding
of
impulsive
behaviour
under
the
influence
of
alcohol
.

This
study
validates
oxidized

noticeably

measurable
in
marine
fish

and
should
be
considered
when

Beta-1
,
4-galactosyltransferase
I
(
beta4Gal-T1
)
normally
transfers
Gal
from
UDP-Gal
to
GlcNAc
in
the
presence
of
Mn
(
2
+
)
ion
(
Gal-T
activity
)
and
also
transfers
Glc
from
UDP-Glc
to
GlcNAc
(
Glc-T
activity
)
,
albeit
at
only
0

efficiency
.

In
addition
,
alpha-lactalbumin
(
LA
)
enhances
this
Glc-T
activity
more
than
25
times
.

Comparison
of
the
crystal
structures
of
UDP-Gal-
and
UDP-Glc-bound
beta4Gal-T1
reveals
that
the
O4
hydroxyl
group
in
both
Gal
and
Glc
moieties
forms
a
hydrogen
bond
with
the
side
chain
carboxylate
group
of
Glu317
.

The
orientation
of
the
O4
hydroxyl
of
glucose
causes
a
steric
hindrance
to
the
side
chain
carboxylate
group
of
Glu317
,
accounting
for
the
enzyme's
low
Glc-T
activity
.

In
this
study
,
we
show
that
mutation
of
Arg228
,
a
residue
in
the
vicinity
of
Glu317
,
to
lysine
(
R228K-Gal-T1
)
results
in
a
15-fold
higher
Glc-T
activity
,
which
is
further
enhanced
by
LA
to
nearly
25%
of
the
Gal-T
activity
of
the
wild
type
.

The
kinetic
parameters
indicate
that
the
main
effect
of
the
mutation
of
Arg228
to
lysine
is
on
the
k
(
cat
)
of
Glc-T
,
which
increases
3-4-fold
,
both
in
the
absence
and
in
the
presence
of
LA;
simultaneously
,
the
k
(
cat
)
for
the
Gal-T
reaction
is
reduced
30-fold
.

A
resolution
shows
that
the
Asp318
side
chain
exhibits
a
minor
alternate
conformation
,
compared
to
that
in
the
wild
type
.

This
alternate
conformation
now
causes
a
steric
hindrance
to
the
O4
hydroxyl
group
of
the
Gal
moiety
of
UDP-Gal
,
probably
causing
the
dissociation
of
UDP-Gal
and
the
reduced
k
(
cat
)
of
the
Gal-T
reaction
.
The
Warburg
effect
in
cancer
cells
has
been
proposed
to
involve
several
mechanisms
,
including
adaptation
to
hypoxia
,
oncogenes
activation
or
loss
of
oncosuppressors
and
impaired
mitochondrial
function
.

In
previous
papers
,
it
has
been
shown
that
K-ras
transformed
mouse
cells
are
much
more
sensitive
as
compared
with
normal
cells
to
glucose
withdrawal
(
undergoing
apoptosis
)
and
present
a
high
glycolytic
rate
and
a
strong
reduction
of
mitochondrial
complex
I
.

Recent
observations
suggest
that
transformed
cells
have
a
derangement
in
the
cyclic
adenosine
monophosphate
/
cAMP-dependent
protein
kinase
(
cAMP
/
PKA
)
pathway
,
which
is
known
to
regulate
several
mitochondrial
functions
.

Herein
,
the
derangement
of
the
cAMP
/
PKA
pathway
and
its
impact
on
transformation-linked
changes
of
mitochondrial
functions
is
investigated
.

Exogenous
stimulation
of
PKA
activity
,
achieved
by
forskolin
treatment
,
protected
K-ras-transformed
cells
from
apoptosis
induced
by
glucose
deprivation
,
enhanced
complex
I
activity
,
intracellular
adenosine
triphosphate
(
ATP
)
levels
,
mitochondrial
fusion
and
decreased
intracellular
reactive
oxygen
species
(
ROS
)
levels
.

Several
of
these
effects
were
almost
completely
prevented
by
inhibiting
the
PKA
activity
.

Short-time
treatment
with
compounds
favoring
mitochondrial
fusion
strongly
decreased
the
cellular
ROS
levels
especially
in
transformed
cells
.

These
findings
support
the
notion
that
glucose
shortage-induced
apoptosis
,
specific
of
K-ras-transformed
cells
,
is
associated
to
a
derangement
of
PKA
signaling
that
leads
to
mitochondrial
complex
I
decrease
,
reduction
of
ATP
formation
,
prevalence
of
mitochondrial
fission
over
fusion
,
and
thereby
opening
new
approaches
for
development
of
anticancer
drugs
.
The
human
ether-a-go-go-related
gene
(
hERG
)
is
a
K
+
channel
protein
mainly
expressed
in
the
heart
and
the
nervous
systems
and
its
blockade
by
non-cardiovascular
acting
drugs
resulted
in
tachycardia
and
sudden
death
.

In
this
present
review
,
we
have
focused
the
physicochemical
properties
responsible
for
the
hERG
blocking
activity
of
structurally
different
compounds
.

The
reported
research
works
showed
that
the
hydrophobicity
on
the
van
der
Waals
(
vdW
)
surface
of
the
molecules
(
aroused
from
the
aromatic
ring
)
necessary
for
the
hERG
blocking
activity
along
with
topological
and
electronic
properties
.

The
quinolizidine
alkaloids
(
natural
products
)
such
as
oxymatrine
,
sophoridine
,
sophocarpine
and
matrine
carry
the
common
molecular
structure
of
O
=
C
=
N-C-C-C-N
that
possessed
positive
ionotropic
effect
and
hERG
blocking
activity
.

Acehytisine
hydrochloride
(
previously
named
Guangfu
base
A
)
was
isolated
from
the
root
of
Aconitum
coreanum
(
Levl
.

)
,
is
an
anti-arrhythmic
drug
in
phase
IV
clinical
trial
.

The
isoquinoline
alkaloid
,
neferine
(
Nef
)
induces
a
concentration-dependent
decrease
in
current
amplitude
(
IC50
of
7
.
419
MM
)
.

Most
of
these
natural
product
compounds
contain
non-flexible
aromatic
structures
but
have
significant
activity
due
to
the
presence
of
optimum
hydrophobicity
.

Recent
research
works
revealed
that
Eag
and
hERG
channels
are
expressed
by
a
variety
of
cancer
cell
lines
and
tissues
.

The
Eag
channel
showed
an
oncogenic
potential
while
hERG
channels
are
associated
with
more
aggressive
tumors
and
have
a
role
in
mediating
invasion
.

This
review
concluded
that
the
consideration
of
physicochemical
properties
necessary
for
the
hERG
blocking
activity
will
guide
to
develop
novel
drugs
with
less
cardiotoxicity
.
Both
poikilotherms
and
homeotherms
live
longer
at
lower
body
temperatures
,
highlighting
a
general
role
of
temperature
reduction
in
lifespan
extension
.

However
,
the
underlying
mechanisms
remain
unclear
.

One
prominent
model
is
that
cold
temperatures
reduce
the
rate
of
chemical
reactions
,
thereby
slowing
the
rate
of
aging
.

This
view
suggests
that
cold-dependent
lifespan
extension
is
simply
a
passive
thermodynamic
process
.

Here
,
we
challenge
this
view
in
C
.

elegans
by
showing
that
genetic
programs
actively
promote
longevity
at
cold
temperatures
.

We
find
that
TRPA-1
,
a
cold-sensitive
TRP
channel
,
detects
temperature
drop
in
the
environment
to
extend
lifespan
.

This
effect
requires
cold-induced
,
TRPA-1-mediated
calcium
influx
and
a
calcium-sensitive
PKC
that
signals
to
the
transcription
factor
DAF-16
/
FOXO
.

Human
TRPA1
can
functionally
substitute
for
worm
TRPA-1
in
promoting
longevity
.

Our
results
reveal
a
previously
unrecognized
function
for
TRP
channels
,
link
calcium
signaling
to
longevity
,
and
,
importantly
,
demonstrate
that
genetic
programs
contribute
to
lifespan
extension
at
cold
temperatures
.
BACKGROUND
/
AIMS
:
It
has
been
proposed
that
,
in
acute
liver
failure
,
skeletal
muscle
adapts
to
become
the
principle
organ
responsible
for
removal
of
blood-borne
ammonia
by
increasing
glutamine
synthesis
,
a
reaction
that
is
catalyzed
by
the
cytosolic
ATP-dependent
enzyme
glutamine
synthetase
.

To
address
this
issue
,
glutamine
synthetase
expression
and
activities
were
measured
in
skeletal
muscle
of
rats
with
acute
liver
failure
resulting
from
hepatic
devascularization
.

METHODS
:
Glutamine
synthetase
protein
and
gene
expression
were
investigated
using
immunoblotting
and
semi-quantitative
RT-PCR
analysis
.

Glutamine
synthetase
activity
and
glutamine
de
novo
synthesis
were
measured
using
,
respectively
,
a
standard
enzymatic
assay
and
[
13C
]
-nuclear
magnetic
resonance
spectroscopy
.

RESULTS
:
Glutamine
synthetase
protein
(
but
not
gene
)
expression
and
enzyme
activities
were
significantly
up-regulated
leading
to
increased
de
novo
synthesis
of
glutamine
and
increased
skeletal
muscle
capacity
for
ammonia
removal
in
acute
liver
failure
.

In
contrast
to
skeletal
muscle
,
expression
and
activities
of
glutamine
synthetase
in
the
brain
were
significantly
decreased
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
These
findings
demonstrate
that
skeletal
muscle
adapts
,
through
a
rapid
induction
of
glutamine
synthetase
,
to
increase
its
capacity
for
removal
of
blood-borne
ammonia
in
acute
liver
failure
.

of

with

could

)
for
the
human
progesterone
and
androgen
receptors
were
measured
in
MCF-7
cytosol
and
intact
MCF-7
cells
.

For
the
binding
to
the
progesterone
receptor
,
both
Org
2058
and
Org
3236
(
or
3-keto-desogestrel
)
were
used
as
labelled
ligands
.

The
following
ranking
(
low
to
high
)
for
the
RBA
of
the
nuclear
(
intact
cells
)
progesterone
receptor
irrespective
of
the
ligand
used
is
found
:
norethisterone
much
less
than
levonorgestrel
less
than
3-keto-destogestrel
less
than
gestodene
.

The
difference
between
the
various
progestagens
is
significant
with
the
exception
of
that
between
3-keto-desogestrel
and
gestodene
,
when
Org
2058
is
used
as
ligand
.

For
the
cytosolic
progesterone
receptor
,
the
same
order
is
found
with
the
exception
that
similar
RBAs
are
found
for
gestodene
and
3-keto-desogestrel
.

The
four
progestagens
clearly
differ
with
respect
to
binding
to
the
androgen
receptor
using
dihydrotestosterone
as
labelled
ligand
in
intact
cells;
the
ranking
(
low
to
high
)
is
:
norethisterone
less
than
3
keto-desogestrel
less
than
levonorgestrel
and
gestodene
.

The
difference
between
3-keto-desogestrel
and
levonorgestrel
or
gestodene
is
significant
.

The
selectivity
indices
(
ratio
of
the
mean
RBA
for
the
progesterone
receptor
to
that
of
androgen
receptor
)
in
intact
cells
are
significantly
higher
for
3-keto-desogestrel
and
gestodene
than
for
levonorgestrel
and
norethisterone
.

From
these
results
we
conclude
that
the
introduction
of
the
18-methyl
in
norethisterone
(
levonorgestel
)
increases
both
the
binding
to
the
progesterone
and
androgen

ABSTRACT
TRUNCATED
AT
250
WORDS
)
Mycobacterium
avium
complex
(
MAC
)
causes
chronic
lung
disease
in
immunocompetent
people
and
disseminated
infection
in
patients
with
AIDS
.

MAC
is
intrinsically
resistant
to
many
conventional
antimycobacterial
agents
,
it
develops
drug
resistance
rapidly
to
macrolide
antibiotics
,
and
patients
with
MAC
infection
experience
frequent
relapses
or
the
inability
to
completely
eradicate
the
infection
with
current
treatment
.

Treatment
regimens
are
prolonged
and
complicated
by
drug
toxicity
or
intolerances
.

We
sought
to
identify
biochemical
pathways
in
MAC
that
can
serve
as
targets
for
novel
antimycobacterial
treatment
.

The
cytochrome
P450
enzyme
,
CYP51
,
catalyzes
an
essential
early
step
in
sterol
metabolism
,
removing
a
methyl
group
from
lanosterol
in
animals
and
fungi
,
or
from
obtusifoliol
in
plants
.

Azoles
inhibit
CYP51
function
,
leading
to
an
accumulation
of
methylated
sterol
precursors
.

This
perturbation
of
normal
sterol
metabolism
compromises
cell
membrane
integrity
,
resulting
in
growth
inhibition
or
cell
death
.

We
have
cloned
and
characterized
a
CYP51
from
MAC
that
functions
as
a
lanosterol
14alpha-demethylase
.

We
show
the
direct
interactions
of
azoles
with
purified
MAC-CYP51
by
absorbance
and
electron
paramagnetic
resonance
spectroscopy
,
and
determine
the
minimum
inhibitory
concentrations
(
MICs
)
of
econazole
,
ketoconazole
,
itraconazole
,
fluconazole
,
and
voriconazole
against
MAC
.

Furthermore
,
we
demonstrate
that
econazole
has
a
MIC
of
4
mug
/
ml
and
a
minimum
bacteriocidal
concentration
of
4
mug
/
ml
,
whereas
ketoconazole
has
a
MIC
of
8
mug
/
ml
and
a
minimum
bacteriocidal
concentration
of
16
mug
/
ml
.

Itraconazole
,
voriconazole
,
and
fluconazole
did
not
inhibit
MAC
growth
to
any
significant
extent
.

After

TPA
,
differentiation
of
the
human
T-lymphoblastoid
cell
line
MOLT-4
was
induced
along
the
T
cell
lineage
,
confirmed
by
a
fall
in
adenosine
deaminase
and
5'-ectonucleotidase
and
a
rise
in
purine
nucleoside
phosphorylase
activity
.

TPA-treated
cells
became
resistant
to
the
cytotoxic
effects
of
1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine
(
Ara-C
)
,
9-beta-D-arabinofuranosyladenine
(
Ara-A
)
,
and
2-chlorodeoxyadenosine
.

This
was
,
in
part
,
due
to
the
altered
cell
cycle
distribution
(
accumulation
of
cells
in
the
G1
phase
)
,
since
the
toxicity
of
Ara-C
and
Ara-A
is
S
phase
specific
.

The
diminished
rate
of
Ara-C
transport
concomitant
with
Ara-CTP
formation
after
TPA
treatment
is
considered
to
be
the
biochemical
basis
for
this
acquired
resistance

The
aryl
hydrocarbon
receptor
is
a
member
of
the
basic-helix-loop-helix
family
of
transcription
factors
.

AhR
mediates
the
biochemical
and
toxic
effects
of
a
number
of
polyaromatic
hydrocarbons
such
as
2
,
3
,
7
,
8
,
-tetrachloro-dibenzo-p-dioxin
(
TCDD
)
.

AhR
is
widely
known
for
regulating
the
transcription
of
drug
metabolizing
enzymes
involved
in
the
xenobiotic
metabolism
of
carcinogens
and
therapeutic
agents
,
such
as
cytochrome
P450-1B1
(
CYP1B1
)
.

Additionally
,
AhR
has
also
been
reported
to
interact
with
multiple
signaling
pathways
during
prostate
development
.

Here
we
investigate
the
effect
of
sustained
AhR
signaling
on
androgen
receptor
function
in
prostate
cancer
cells
.

Immunoblot
analysis
shows
that
AhR
expression
is
increased
in
androgen
independent
(
C4-2
)
prostate
cancer
cells
when
compared
to
androgen
sensitive
(
LNCaP
)
cells
.

RT-PCR
studies
revealed
constitutive
AhR
signaling
in
C4-2
cells
without
the
ligand
induced
activation
required
in
LNCaP
cells
.

A
reduction
of
AhR
activity
by
short
RNA
mediated
silencing
in
C4-2
cells
reduced
expression
of
both
AhR
and
androgen
responsive
genes
.

The
decrease
in
androgen
responsive
genes
correlates
to
a
decrease
in
phosphorylated
androgen
receptor
and
androgen
receptor
expression
in
the
nucleus
.

Furthermore
,
the
forced
decrease
in
AhR
expression
resulted
in
a
50%
decline
in
the
growth
rate
of
C4-2
cells
.

These
data
indicates
that
AhR
is
required
to
maintain
hormone
independent
signaling
and
growth
by
the
androgen
receptor
in
C4-2
cells
.

Collectively
,
these
data
provide
evidence
of
a
direct
role
for
AhR
in
androgen
independent
signaling
and
provides
insight
into
the
molecular
mechanisms
responsible
for
sustained
androgen
receptor
signaling

Propylthiouracil
(
PTU
)
is
recommended
as
a
first-line
antithyroid
drug
(
ATD
)
during
first
trimester
organogenesis
in
pregnancy
because
recent
evidence
suggests
that
methimazole
(
MMI
)
may
be
associated
with
congenital
anomalies
.

However
,
PTU
more
commonly
causes
myeloperoxidase
(
MPO
)
-antineutrophil
cytoplasmic
antibody
(
ANCA
)
-associated
vasculitis
,
which
usually
occurs
during
prolonged
treatment
,
compared
with
MMI
.

We
report
a
case
of
MPO-ANCA-associated
vasculitis
in
a
35-year-old
woman
with
Graves'disease
.

Although
her
thyroid
function
could
be
maintained
euthyroid
by
MMI
,
her
ATD
was
switched
to
PTU
because
she
wished
to
become
pregnant
.

The
patient
presented
with
flu-like
symptoms
8
days
after
starting
PTU
and
developed
hemoptysis
and
dyspnea
at
22
days
.

Her
MPO-ANCA
titer
was
21
ELISA
units
(
EUs
)
before
PTU
treatment
but
increased
to
259
EUs
at
22
days
after
PTU
treatment
.

Her
clinical
condition
improved
with
the
discontinuation
of
PTU
and
with
immunosuppressive
therapy
.

This
case
indicated
that
MPO-ANCA
vasculitis
occurred
within
several
weeks
after
the
initiation
of
PTU
and
that
this
side
effect
could
be
caused
by
the
change
from
MMI
to
PTU
.

Thus
,
our
clinical
observation
suggests
that
patients
treated
with
PTU
should
be
carefully
monitored
for
MPO-ANCA
titers
and
variable
manifestations
of
MPO-ANCA-associated
vasculitis
regardless
of
the
period
of
administration
.

ADMA
was
intraperitoneally
administrated
for
7

.

The
serum

IL-10
were
measured
.

There
was
a
significant
decrease
in
the
levels

in
group
I
compared
with
that
of

.

There
was
also
a
significant
decrease
in
the
levels
of
IL-10
in
group

compared
with
that
of
the

was
much
more
distinct
in
the

.

When
comparing
the

given
,
no

between
the
levels
of
IL-6
and
IL-10
in
groups

(

was
observed;
the

those
of

Aspirin
is
a
commonly
used
drug
with
a
wide
pharmacological
spectrum
including
antiplatelet
,
anti-inflammatory
,
and
neuroprotective
actions
.

This
study
shows
that
aspirin
and
sodium
salicylate
,
its
major
blood
metabolite
,
reverse
contractile
actions
of
endothelin-1
(
ET-1
)
in

rat
aorta
and

mammary
arteries
.

They
also
prevent
the

+
)
mobilizing
action
of
ET-1
in

endothelial
cells
but
not
those
of

Inhibition
of
the
actions
of
ET-1
by
salicylates
is
apparently
competitive
.

Salicylates
inhibit

)

)
I-ET-1
ETA

complexes
both
in

absence

.

It
has
no
influence
on
the
rate
of
association
of
(
125
)
I-ET-1
to

.

Salicylates
do
not
promote
dissociation
of

Salicylates
potentiate

The
neuropeptide
oxytocin
is
involved
in
social
cognition
and
interaction
across
species
and
plays
a
crucial
role
in
the
regulation
of
affiliative
behaviors
.

Oxytocin
levels
in
cerebrospinal
fluid
(
CSF
)
,
but
also
in
plasma
or
urine
,
have
been
shown
to
be
negatively
associated
with
childhood
traumata
,
aggressive
behavior
,
and
suicide
attempts
.

Recently
,
an
altered
activity
of
the
oxytocin
system
has
been
discussed
to
play
a
prominent
role
in
borderline
personality
disorder
(
BPD
)
,
which
is
thought
to
be
closely
related
to
traumatic
experiences
in
childhood
and
is
characterized
by
(
para
)
suicidal
behaviors
as
well
as
aggressive
outbursts
.

In
the
present
study
,
we
compared
plasma
oxytocin
levels
of
women
with
and
without
BPD
in
the
follicular
phase
and
assessed
the
relationship
between
oxytocin
concentrations
and
childhood
traumata
.

Women
diagnosed
with
BPD
had
significantly
reduced
oxytocin
concentrations
,
even
after
controlling
for
estrogen
,
progesterone
,
and
contraceptive
intake
.

In
addition
,
plasma
oxytocin
correlated
negatively
with
experiences
of
childhood
traumata
,
in
particular
with
emotional
neglect
and
abuse
.

The
results
of
mediation
analyses
do
not
support
a
model
of
oxytocin
being
a
prominent
mediator
in
the
link
between
childhood
trauma
and
BPD
.

Thus
,
the
findings
indicate
dysregulations
in
the
oxytocin
system
of
patients
diagnosed
with
BPD
with
more
longitudinal
research
being
necessary
to
disentangle

,
and

A
lot
of
research
has
been
carried
out
in
the
last
decade
to
find
a
cure
for
neurodegenerative
diseases
especially
Parkinson's
disease
but
to
little
avail
.

In
this
study

PLGA
)
/

water-in-oil-in-water
(
W

)
double

,
as

vehicle
.

The
microparticles
were
encapsulated
with
glial
cell-derived
neurotrophic
factor
(
GDNF
)
fused
with
collagen
binding
peptide
(
CBP
)
immobilized
to
the
inner
collagen
phase
.

The
novelty
lies
in
the
strict
regulation
of
release
of
GDNF-CBP
from
the
microparticles
as
compared
to
a
burst
release
from
standard
microparticles
.

The
microparticles
were
demonstrated
to
be
non-cytotoxic
till
300μg

and
revealed
a

Differentiation
of

cells
(

)
into
mature
neurons
was
demonstrated
by
co-culturing
microparticles
with
cells
in
a
medium
containing

which
enabled
the

encapsulated
GDNF-CBP
,
signaling
the

The
successful

of
these
microparticles

and
allow

of

some

To
predict

exposure
required
to
achieve
antitumor

in
mouse
xenograft
models
,
we
directly
measured
target

after
SU11248
treatment
and
correlated
this
with
plasma

Constant

This
study
describes
molecular
mechanisms
for
inhibiting
tumour
cell
proliferation
using
polysaccharides
from
medicinal
mushrooms
in
human
hepatoma
cells
.

The
results
show
that
regarding
cell
cycle-related
proteins
,
three
types
of
polysaccharides
significantly
enhance
the
expression
of
p27
(
Kip
)
in
HepG2
and
Bel-7404
cells
,
while
suppressing
the
activity
of
cyclin
D1
/
CDK4
and
/
or
cyclin
E
/
CDK2
.

Considering
apoptosis-related
factors
,
the
polysaccharides
suppressed
AKT
activity
through
the
inhibition
of
AKT
phosphorylation
at
Thr
(
308
)
and
/
or
Ser
(
473
)
.

The
growth
of
HepG2
and
Bel-7404
cells
was
suppressed
by
the
up-regulation
of
a
subunit
of
PI3K
and
phospho-PTEN
,
which
are
modulators
of
AKT
activity
.

The
polysaccharides
also
activated
the
mitochondria-mediated
apoptosis
pathway
by
stimulating
the
activation
of
Bcl-2
family
proteins
to
release
cytochrome
c
and
Smac
and
cleave
caspase-9
and
caspase-3
in
HepG2
and
Bel-7404
cells
.

These
factors
have
a
potent
effect
on
cell
cycle
arrest
in
G
(

)
and

or
S
phase
and
induce

.
The
ATP-sensitive
potassium
(
KATP
)
channels
in
pancreatic
beta
cells
are
critical
in
the
regulation
of
glucose-induced
insulin
secretion
.

Although
electrophysiological
studies
provide
clues
to
the
complex
control
of
KATP
channels
by
ATP
,
MgADP
,
and
pharmacological
agents
,
the
molecular
mechanism
of
KATP-channel
regulation
remains
unclear
.

The
KATP
channel
is
a
heterooligomeric
complex
of
SUR1
subunits
of
the
ATP-binding-cassette
superfamily
with
two
nucleotide-binding
folds
(
NBF1
and
NBF2
)
and
the
pore-forming
Kir6
.
2
subunits
.

Here
,
we
report
that
MgATP
and
MgADP
,
but
not
the
Mg
salt
of
gamma-thio-ATP
,
stabilize
the
binding
of
prebound
8-azido-
[
alpha-32P
]
ATP
to
SUR1
.

Mutation
in
the
Walker
A
and
B
motifs
of
NBF2
of
SUR1
abolished
this
stabilizing
effect
of
MgADP
.

These
results
suggest
that
SUR1
binds
8-azido-ATP
strongly
at
NBF1
and
that
MgADP
,
either
by
direct
binding
to
NBF2
or
by
hydrolysis
of
bound
MgATP
at
NBF2
,
stabilizes
prebound
8-azido-ATP
binding
at
NBF1
.

The
sulfonylurea
glibenclamide
caused
release
of
prebound
8-azido-
[
alpha-32P
]
ATP
from
SUR1
in
the
presence
of
MgADP
or
MgATP
in
a
concentration-dependent
manner
.

This
direct
biochemical
evidence
of
cooperative
interaction
in
nucleotide
binding
of
the
two
NBFs
of
SUR1
suggests
that
glibenclamide
both
blocks
this
cooperative
binding
of
ATP
and
MgADP
and
,
in
cooperation
with
the
MgADP
bound
at
NBF2
,
causes
ATP
to
be
released
from
NBF1
.
We
examined
the
effects
of
the
calcium
channel
blockers
nitrendipine
,
diltiazem
,
verapamil
,
bepridil
,
and
mibefradil
on
the
cloned
HERG

channels
.

These
channels
generate
the
rapid
and
slow
components
of
the
cardiac
delayed

K

current
,
and
mutations
can
affect
them
,
which
leads
to
long

syndromes
.

When
expressed
in
transfected
COS
cells
,
HERG
is
blocked
in
a
concentration-dependent
manner
by
bepridil
(

)
,
verapamil
(

)
,
and
mibefradil
(
EC50
=
1
.
43
microM
)
,
whereas
nitrendipine
and
diltiazem
have
negligible
effects
.

Steady
state
activation
and
inactivation
parameters
are
shifted
to
more
negative
values
in
the
presence
of
the
blockers
.

Similarly
,
KvLQT1
/
IsK
is
inhibited
by
bepridil
(
EC50
=
10
.
0
microM
)
and
mibefradil
(
EC50
=
11
.
8
microM
)
,
while
being
insensitive
to
nitrendipine
,
diltiazem
,
or
verapamil
.

These
results
demonstrate
that
both
cloned
K
+
channels
HERG
and
KvLQT1
/
IsK
,
which
represent
together
the
cardiac
delayed
rectifier
K

current
,
are
sensitive
targets
to
calcium
channel
blockers
.

This
work
may
help
in
understanding
the
mechanisms
of

of
verapamil

well
as

Lung
cancer
is
the
leading

Evidence
suggests
that
lung
cancer
could
originate
from
mutations
accumulating
in
a
subpopulation
of
self-renewing
cells
,
lung
stem
cells
.

Aldehyde

(
ALDH
)
is
a
marker
of
stem
cells
.

To
investigate
the
presence
of
DNA
modifications
in
these
cells
,
we
isolated
ALDH-positive
lung
cells
from
A
/
J
mice
exposed
to
the
lung
carcinogen
4-
(
methylnitrosamino
)
-1-

,
7-POB-G
,
and

(

were
positively
identified
in
ALDH-positive
cell
DNA
.

This
is
the
first
example
of
detection
of
carcinogen-DNA

supporting
the
hypothesis
of
their
role
in

BACKGROUND
:
Eosinophil
influx
into
the
lung
tissue
is
considered
to
be
relevant
for
the
pathogenesis
of
asthma
.

Various
chemotactic
factors
may
be
responsible
for
this
influx
.

Recently
it
has
been
demonstrated
that
the
cytokines
granulocyte-macrophage
colony-stimulating
factor
(
GM-CSF
)
,
interleukin-3
(
IL-3
)
,
and
interleukin-5
(
IL-5
)
are
present
in
the
circulation
of
individuals
with
allergic
asthma
.

These
cytokines
have
the
capacity
to
modulate
chemotactic
responses
of
eosinophils
toward
platelet-activating
factor
,
formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine
,
(
FMLP
)
and
neutrophil-activating
factor
(
NAF
)
/
IL-8
,
but
not
toward
complement
fragment
C5a
(
C5a
)
.

Here
the
effect
of
nedocromil
sodium
on
the
chemotactic
response
of
eosinophils
from
allergic
asthmatic
individuals
and
from
normal
donors
preincubated
with
GM-CSF
or
IL-3
toward
FMLP
,
NAF
/
IL-8
was
evaluated
.

RESULTS
:
Nedocromil
sodium
inhibited
the
chemotactic
response
toward
FMLP
and
NAF
/
IL-8
of
GM-CSF
primed
eosinophils
approximately
60%
(
inhibitory
concentration
of
50%
[
IC50
]
approximately
1
to
10
nmol
/
L
)
,
whereas
these
responses
of
IL-3
primed
eosinophils
was
completely
inhibited
(
IC50
approximately
1
nmol
/
L
)
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
The
chemotactic
responses
toward
C5a
were
inhibited
by
nedocromil
sodium
at
higher
concentrations
than
were
required
in
the
priming
studies
(
IC50
approximately
10
to
100
nmol
/
L
)
.

Nedocromil
sodium
(
0
.
1
mumol
/
L
)
was
also
effective
in
inhibiting
the
chemotactic
response
toward
FMLP
(
10
nmol
/
L
)
of
eosinophils
isolated
from
the
circulation
of
patients
with
allergic
asthma
3
hours
after
allergen
challenge
.

These
findings
might
explain
in
part
the
antiinflammatory
action
of
nedocromil
sodium
.

Voltage-gated

component
of
electrically

cells
.

Phenytoin
(
diphenylhydantoin
,
DPH
)
is
an
established
sodium
channel
blocker
and
is
a
useful
anticonvulsant
and
class
1b
antiarrhythmic
,
and
has
been
effectively
used
in
the
treatment
of
neuropathic
pain
.

In
this
study
,
we
have
synthesized
novel
alpha-hydroxyphenylamide
analogues
of
diphenylhydantoin
and
examined
their
ability
to
inhibit
human
Na
(
V
)
1
.
5
sodium
channels
expressed
in
Chinese
Hamster
Ovary
(
CHO-K1
)
cells
.

Phenyl
ring
substitutions
were
examined
including
para-methyl
,
para-fluoro
,
para-chloro
,
ortho-chloro
and
meta-chloro
.

We
have
found
that
phenyl
ring
substitutions
with
electron
withdrawing
properties
resulted
in
compounds
with
greater
activity
.

In
comparison
to
diphenylhydantoin
,
the
novel
chloro-substituted
alpha-hydroxyphenylamide
compounds
produced
as
much
as
a
20-fold
greater
tonic
and
frequency-dependent
blockade
of
Na
(
V
)
1
.
5
channels
with
an
IC
(
50
)
value
of
14
.
5
microM
.

In
addition
,
the
chloro-substitutions
have
position
specific
state
dependent
blocking
properties
.

The
ortho-
,
meta-
and
para-chloro
substitutions
have
an
8-
,
13-
and
3-fold
increased
affinity
for
the
inactivated
state
,
respectively
.

Molecular
modeling
suggests
that
these
differences
in
affinity
are
due
to
a
direct
interaction
with
the
receptor
.

Comparing
models
of
diphenylhydantoin
to
the
novel
alpha-hydroxyphenlyamide
compound
suggests
that
the
increased
activity
may
be
due
to
an
optimized
phenyl
ring
position
and
increased
molecular
volume
.

This
information
may
be
useful
in
the
development
of
more
potent
sodium
channel
blockers
.

This
study
aims
to
investigate
the
potential
of
antioxidant
enzyme
activities
(
AEA
)
as
biomarkers
of
oxidative
stress
in
freshwater
biofilms
.

Therefore
,
biofilms
were
grown
in
channels
for
38
days
and
then
exposed
to
different
concentrations
(
0-150μgL
(
-1
)
)
of
the
herbicide
oxyfluorfen
for
5
more
weeks
.

Under
control
conditions
,
the
AEA
of
biofilms
were
found
to
change
throughout
time
with
a
significant
increase
in
ascorbate
peroxidase
(
APX
)
activity
during
the
exponential
growth
and
a
more
important
role
of
catalase
(
CAT
)
and
glutathione
reductase
(
GR
)
activities
during
the
slow
growth
phase
.

Chronic
exposure
to
oxyfluorfen
led
to
slight
variations
in
AEA
,
however
,
the
ranges
of
variability
of
AEA
in
controls
and
exposed
communities
were
similar
,
highlighting
the
difficulty
of
a
direct
interpretation
of
AEA
values
.

After
5
weeks
of
exposure
to
oxyfluorfen
,
no
clear
effects
were
observed
on
chl-a
concentration
or
on
the
composition
of
other
pigments
suggesting
that
algal
group
composition
was
not
affected
.

Eukaryotic
communities
were
structured
clearly
by
toxicant
concentration
and
both
eukaryotic
and
bacterial
richness
were
reduced
in
communities
exposed
to
the
highest
concentration
.

In
addition
,
during
acute
exposure
tests
performed
at
the
end
of
the
chronic
exposure
,
biofilms
chronically
exposed
to
75
and
150μgL
(
-1
)
oxyfluorfen
showed
a
higher
CAT
activity
than
controls
.

Chronic
exposure
to
oxyfluorfen
provoked
then
structural
changes
but
also
functional
changes
in
the
capacity
of
biofilm
CAT
activity
to
respond
to
a
sudden
increase
in
concentration
,
suggesting
a
selection
of
species
with
higher
antioxidant
capacity
.

This
study
highlighted
the
difficulty
of
interpretation
of
AEA
values
due
to
their
temporal
variation
and
to
the
absence
of
absolute
threshold
value
indicative
of
oxidative
stress
induced
by
contaminants
.

Nevertheless
,
the
determination
of
AEA
pattern
throughout
acute
exposure
test
is
of
high
interest
to
compare
oxidative
stress
levels
undergone
by
different
biofilm
communities
and
thus
determine
their
antioxidant
capacity
.
OBJECTIVE
:
Vesicular
monoamine
transporter

(
VMAT-1
)
mRNA
and
protein
were
examined
(
1
)
to
determine
whether
adult
mouse
brain
expresses
full-length
VMAT-1
mRNA
that
can
be
translated
to
functional
transporter
protein
and
(
2
)
to
compare
immunoreactive
VMAT-1
proteins
in
brain
and
adrenal
.

METHODS
:
VMAT-1
mRNA
was
detected
in
mouse
brain
with
RT-PCR
.

The
cDNA
was
sequenced
,
cloned
into
an
expression
vector
,
transfected
into
COS-1
cells
,
and
cell
protein
was
assayed
for
VMAT-1
activity
.

Immunoreactive
proteins
were
examined
on
western
blots
probed
with
four
different
antibodies
to
VMAT-1
.

RESULTS
:
Sequencing
confirmed
identity
of
the
entire
coding
sequences
of
VMAT-1
cDNA
from
mouse
medulla
oblongata
/
pons
and
adrenal
to
a
Gen-Bank
reference
sequence
.

Transfection
of
the
brain
cDNA
into
COS-1
cells
resulted
in
transporter
activity
that
was
blocked
by
the
VMAT
inhibitor
reserpine
and
a
proton
ionophore
,
but
not
by
tetrabenazine
,
which
has
a
high
affinity
for
VMAT-2
.

Antibodies
to
either
the
C-
or
N-
terminus
of
VMAT-1
detected
two
proteins
(
73
and
55
kD
)
in
transfected
COS-1
cells
.

The
C-terminal
antibodies
detected
both
proteins
in
extracts
of
mouse
medulla
/
pons
,
cortex
,
hypothalamus
,
and
cerebellum
but
only
the
73
kD
protein
and

immunoreactive
proteins
in
mouse
adrenal
and
rat
PC12
cells
,
which
are
positive
controls
for

VMAT-1
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
These
findings
demonstrate
that
a
functional
VMAT-1
mRNA
coding
sequence
is
expressed
in
mouse
brain
and
suggest
processing
of
VMAT-1

differs
in

BACKGROUND
:
Deficits
in
executive
functions
such
as
access
to
semantic

have
been
shown
in
ecstasy

in
previous

.

Equally
,
there
have
been
many
reports
of
equivocal
findings
in
this
area
.

The
current
study
sought
to
further
investigate
behavioural
and
electro-physiological
measures
of
this
executive
function
in
ecstasy

.

METHOD
:
Twenty
ecstasy-polydrug

,
20
non-ecstasy-polydrug

and
20
drug-naïve

were
recruited
.

Participants
completed
background
questionnaires
about
their

.

Each
individual
also
completed
a

RESULTS
:

Subsequent

Expression
of
Cyp1a1
and
its
related
enzyme
activity
have
long
been
used
as
a
biomarker
for
aryl
hydrocarbon
receptor
(
AhR
)
activation
and
a
warning
of
dioxin-like
toxicity
.

As
a
result
,
induction
of
Cyp1a1
by
pharmaceutical
drug
candidates
or
environmental
contaminants
raises
significant
concern
in
risk
assessment
.

The
current
study
evaluates
the
specificity
of
Cyp1a1
induction
as
a
marker
for
AhR
affinity
and
activation
and
provides
context
to
assess
the
relevancy
of
AhR
activation
to
risk
assessment
.

In
vivo
experiments
examined
the
expression
of
Cyp1a1
and
other
AhR-regulated
genes
in
liver
,
kidney
,
and
heart
in
response
to
596
compounds
.

From
this
data
set
,
a
subset
of
147
compounds
was
then
evaluated
for
their
ability
to
activate
or
bind
to
the
AhR
using
a
combination
of
gel
shift
,
reporter
gene
,
and
competitive
receptor
binding
assays
.

Whereas
in
vivo
Cyp1a1
mRNA
expression
is
a
sensitive
marker
for
AhR
activation
,
it
lacks
specificity
,
because
81
(
59%
)
of
137
compounds
were
found
to
significantly
induce
Cyp1a1
in
vivo
but
were
not
verified
to
bind
or
activate
the
AhR
in
vitro
.

Combining
in
vivo
and
in
vitro
findings
,
we
identified
nine
AhR
agonists
,
six
of
which
are
marketed
therapeutics
and
have
been
approved
by
the

,

,
and
nimodipine
.

These
drugs
do
not
produce
dioxin-like
toxicity
in
rats
or
in
humans
.

These
data
demonstrate
that
induction
of
Cyp1a1
is
a
nonspecific
biomarker
of
direct
AhR
affinity
and
activation
and
lend
further
support
to
the
hypothesis
that
Cyp1a1
induction
and
/
or
AhR
activation
is
not
synonymous
with
dioxin-like
toxicity
.

The
neuronal
glutamate
transporter
EAAC1
contains
several
conserved
acidic
amino
acids
in
its
transmembrane
domain
,
which
are
possibly
important
in
catalyzing
transport
and
/
or
binding
of
co
/
countertransported
cations
.

Here
,
we
have
studied
the
effects
of
neutralization
by
site-directed
mutagenesis
of
three
of
these
amino
acid
side
chains
,
glutamate
373
,
aspartate
439
,
and
aspartate
454
,
on
the
functional
properties
of
the
transporter
.

Transport
was
analyzed
by
whole-cell
current
recording
from
EAAC1-expressing
mammalian
cells
after
applying
jumps
in
voltage
,
substrate
,
or
cation
concentration
.

Neutralization
mutations
in
positions
373
and
454
,
although
eliminating
steady-state
glutamate
transport
,
have
little
effect
on
the
kinetics
and
thermodynamics
of
Na
(
+
)
and
glutamate
binding
,
suggesting
that
these
two
positions
do
not
constitute
the
sites
of
Na
(
+
)
and
glutamate
association
with
EAAC1
.

In
contrast
,
the
D439N
mutation
resulted
in
an
approximately
10-fold
decrease
of
apparent
affinity
of
the
glutamate-bound
transporter
form
for
Na
(
+
)
,
and
an
approximately
2
,
000-fold
reduction
in
the
rate
of
Na
(
+
)
binding
,
whereas
the
kinetics
and
thermodynamics
of
Na
(
+
)
binding
to
the
glutamate-free
transporter
were
almost
unchanged
compared
to
EAAC1
(
WT
)
.

Furthermore
,
the
D439N
mutation
converted
l-glutamate
,
THA
,
and
PDC
,
which
are
activating
substrates
for
the
wild-type
anion
conductance
,
but
not
l-aspartate
,
into
transient
inhibitors
of
the
EAAC1
(
D439
)
anion
conductance
.

Activation
of
the
anion
conductance
by
l-glutamate
was
biphasic
,
allowing
us
to
directly
analyze
binding
of
two
of
the
three
cotransported
Na
(
+
)
ions
as
a
function
of
time
and
[
Na
(
+
)
]
.

The
data
can
be
explained
with
a
model
in
which
the
D439N
mutation
results
in
a
dramatic
slowing
of
Na
(
+
)
binding
and
a
reduced
affinity
of
the
substrate-bound
EAAC1
for
Na
(
+
)
.

We
propose
that
the
bound
substrate
controls
the
rate
and
the
extent
of
Na
(
+
)
interaction
with
the
transporter
,
depending
on
the
amino
acid
side
chain

Effects

.
OBJECTIVE
:
Angiotensin
II-receptor
blockers
are
an
established
class
of
antihypertensive
agents
,
but
the
differences
between
individual
members
of
the
class
are
largely
unknown
.

The
present
study
employed
an
animal
model
to
demonstrate
angiotensin
II-receptor
blocker-specific
effects
and
to
quantify
these
differences
by
comparing
two
common
agents
,
losartan
and
valsartan
.

METHODS
:
We
measured
the
effects
on
angiotensin
II
AT2-receptor-mediated
renal
cGMP
by
microdialysis
in
the
outer
renal
cortex
in
conscious
normotensive
,
sodium-depleted
,
4-week-old
Sprague-Dawley
rats
.

Rats
(
n
=
8
)
were
given
equimolar
and
equidepressor
doses
of
losartan
(
0
.
02
mmol
/
kg
)
or
valsartan
(
0
.
02
mmol
/
kg
)
either
intravenously
or
orally
.

Time
was
allowed
for
the
conversion
of
losartan
into
its
active
metabolite
,
EXP
3174
.

RESULTS
:
Both
drugs
had
equal
effects
on
blood
pressure
.

There
were
significantly
greater
increases
in
cGMP
levels
after
administration
of
valsartan
than
of
losartan
with
both
routes
of
administration
.

Intravenous
administration
of
valsartan
led
to
a
69
.
1%
increase
in
cGMP
,
versus
a
10
.
3%
increase
with
losartan
.

Five
hours
after
oral
administration
of
valsartan
,
a
48%
increase
in
cGMP
was
observed
versus
a
10
.
9%
increase
with
losartan
.

The
increase
after
oral
administration
of
valsartan
was
sustained
8
h
after
administration
,
whereas
the
effect
of
losartan
was
not
sustained
.

The
effects
of
losartan
and
valsartan
on
cGMP
were
completely
inhibited
by
AT2-receptor
blockade
.

CONCLUSION
:
The
results
indicate
that
AT1-receptor
blockade
with
valsartan
influences
AT2-receptor-mediated
angiotensin
II
responses
to
a
greater
extent
than
with
losartan

This
study
was
conducted
to
compare
the
effects
of
oral
toxicity
induced
by
fish
oil
biodiesel
and
diesel
fuel
.

Diesel
and
fish
oil
biodiesel
were
administered
by
oral
gavage
to
rats
.

For
this
purpose
,
35
rats
were
divided
into
five
groups
.

Sunflower
oil
of
250
mg
kg
(
-1
)
was
administered
to
the
rats
in
the
control
group
by
oral
gavage
.

The
rats
in
the
D250
and
D500
groups
were
administered
by
oral
gavage
250
mg
kg
(
-1
)
and
500
mg
kg
(
-1
)
of
diesel
fuel
dissolved
in
equal
amounts
of
sunflower
oil
,
respectively
.

The
rats
in
the
F250
and
F500
groups
were
administered
by
oral
gavage
250
mg
kg
(
-1
)
and
500
mg
kg
(
-1
)
of
fish
oil
biodiesel
dissolved
in
equal
amounts
of
sunflower
oil
,
respectively
.

At
the
end
of
the
study
,
malondialdehyde
(
MDA
)
and
reduced
glutathione
(
GSH
)
levels
were
measured
in
the
whole
blood;
catalase

activity
level
was
measured
in
erythrocytes;
and
nitrite
(
NO
(

)
)
and
nitrate
(
NO
(
3
)
)
levels
were
measured
in
the
serum
.

It
was
observed
that
the
whole
blood
MDA
levels
of
the
diesel
groups
were
considerably
different
from
those
in
the
control
and
fish
oil
biodiesel
groups
(
p
<
0
.

)
.

GSH
levels
in
the
control
group
were
observed
to
be
considerably
different
from
those
in
all
other
groups
(
p
<
0
.
001
)
.

Serum
NO
(
3
)
concentrations
in
the
diesel
groups
were
found
to
be
considerably
different
from
those
in
the
control
and
biodiesel
groups
.

Serum
NO
(
2
)
concentrations
in
one
of
the
diesel
groups
were
significantly
different
from
those
in
the
control
and
biodiesel
groups
(
p
<
0
.
01
and
p
<
0
.
05
,
respectively
)
.

The
CAT
activity
of
the
control
group
was
observed
to
be
different
from
that
in
the
other
groups
.

According
to
these
results
,
both
fish
oil
biodiesel
and
diesel
fuel
are
thought
to
cause
lipid
peroxidation
.

It
was
observed
that
fish
oil
biodiesel
does
not
induce
as
much
oxidative
damage
as
does
the
diesel
fuel
.

It
is
suggested
that
fish
oil
biodiesel
should
be
preferred
as
an
alternative
to
the
diesel
.
Alcohol
dehydrogenases
(
ADH
)
participate
in
the
biosynthetic
pathway
of
aroma
volatiles
in
fruit
by
interconverting
aldehydes
to
alcohols
and
providing
substrates
for
the
formation
of
esters
.

Two
highly
divergent
ADH
genes
(
15%
identity
at
the
amino
acid
level
)
of
Cantaloupe
Charentais
melon
(
Cucumis
melo
var
.

Cantalupensis
)
have
been
isolated
.

Cm-ADH1
belongs
to
the
medium-chain
zinc-binding
type
of
ADHs
and
is
highly
similar
to
all
ADH
genes
expressed
in
fruit
isolated
so
far
.

Cm-ADH2
belongs
to
the
short-chain
type
of
ADHs
.

The
two
encoded
proteins
are
enzymatically
active
upon
expression
in
yeast
.

Cm-ADH1
has
strong
preference
for
NAPDH
as
a
co-factor
,
whereas
Cm-ADH2
preferentially
uses
NADH
.

Both
Cm-ADH
proteins
are
much
more
active
as
reductases
with
K
(
m
)
s
10-20
times
lower
for
the
conversion
of
aldehydes
to
alcohols
than
for
the
dehydrogenation
of
alcohols
to
aldehydes
.

They
both
show
strong
preference
for
aliphatic
aldehydes
but
Cm-ADH1
is
capable
of
reducing
branched
aldehydes
such
as
3-methylbutyraldehyde
,
whereas
Cm-ADH2
cannot
.

Both
Cm-ADH
genes
are
expressed
specifically
in
fruit
and
up-regulated
during
ripening
.

Gene
expression
as
well
as
total
ADH
activity
are
strongly
inhibited
in
antisense
ACC
oxidase
melons
and
in
melon
fruit
treated
with
the
ethylene
antagonist
1-methylcyclopropene
(
1-MCP
)
,
indicating
a
positive
regulation
by
ethylene
.

These
data
suggest
that
each
of
the
Cm-ADH
protein
plays
a
specific
role
in
the
regulation
of
aroma
biosynthesis
in
melon
fruit
.

Administration
approved
lubiprostone
for
the
treatment
of
chronic
constipation
in

Lubiprostone
is
categorized
as
a
prostone
,
a

.

Lubiprostone
activates
a

and
its
use
in
the
synthesis
of

The

and
on

In

,
hydrophobic

Plasma
measurement
of
cardiac

constitutes
promising
markers
of
congenital

However
,
concentrations
change
rapidly
and
dramatically
during
the
first
days
after
delivery
even
in
healthy
neonates
,
which
complicates
clinical
interpretation
.

It
is
unknown
whether
these
changes
in
plasma
concentrations
are
explained
by
corresponding
changes
in
the
cardiac
gene
expression
.

We
quantified
the
chamber-specific
mRNA
levels
of
ANP
(
A-type
natriuretic
peptide
)
and
BNP
(
B-type
natriuretic

during
the
first
72
hours
of
life
(

.

Chamber-specific
ANP
and
BNP
mRNA
levels
reflected
hemodynamic
neonate
changes
at
birth
but
did
not
correlate
with
circulating
natriuretic

concentrations
.

However
,
plasma
pro-ANP
and
creatinine
concentrations
were
closely
correlated
(
P

.

Plasma

were
highest
on
the

During

suggested
that
the

In

To
conclude
,
ANP

gene
expression
differs
considerably
between
cardiac

in
the
first
72
hours
of

in
healthy

the

Recent
progress
in

of
the

alterations
that
occur
in

The

Osteosarcoma

malignant
bone
tumor
.

Pterostilbene
(

)
is
a

,
dimethylated
analog
of
resveratrol
with

bioavailability
.

While
PTE
has
been
shown
to
have
potent
antitumor
activity
against
various
types

cancer
,
the
molecular
mechanisms
underlying
the
effects

PTE
remain
largely
unknown

The

a
crucial
role
in
tumorigenesis
and
immune
development
.

In
this
study
,
we
assessed
the
antitumor
activity
of
PTE
against
human
osteosarcoma
cells
and
explored
the
role
of
JAK2
/
STAT3
and
apoptosis-related
signaling
pathways
on
the
activity
of
PTE
.

PTE
treatment
resulted
in
a
dose-
and
time-dependent
inhibition
of
osteosarcoma
cell
viability
.

Additionally
,
PTE
exhibited
strong
antitumor
activity
,
as
evidenced
not
only
by
reductions
in
tumor
cell
adhesion
,
migration
and
mitochondrial
membrane
potential
(
MMP
)
but
also
by
increases
in
the
apoptotic
index
,
reactive
oxygen
species
(
ROS
)
and
several
biochemical
parameters
.

Furthermore
,
PTE
treatment
directly
inhibited
the
phosphorylation
of
JAK2
at
Tyr
1007
and
the
downstream
activation
of
STAT3
.

PTE
also
down-regulated
the
expression
of
STAT3
target
genes
,
including
the
anti-apoptotic
proteins
Bcl-xL
and
Mcl-1
,
leading
to
the

apoptosis
pathway-related
proteins
(

,
and

PTE
,
used
in
combination
with
a
known
JAK2
/
STAT3
inhibitor
,
AG490
,
further
decreased
the
viability
of
osteosarcoma
cells
.

Taken
together
,
PTE
is
a
potent
inhibitor
of
osteosarcoma
cell
growth
that
targets
the
JAK2
/
STAT3
signaling
pathway
.

These
data
suggest
that
inhibition
of
JAK2
/
STAT3
signaling
is
a
novel
mechanism
of
action
for
PTE
during
therapeutic
intervention

There

A

total

was
observed
and
no
significant

was
found
on

.

However
,
the
extent
of
lipid
peroxidation
(
42%
)
and
the
depletion
of
glutathione
(
28

8%

was
greater
after
dermal
sub-acute

of
cypermethrin
(

for

Similarly
,
it
was
observed
that
the

,
superoxide

and
glutathione

(
38

was
higher
in
dermally
cypermethrin
exposed
animals
.

Thus
,
the
present
investigation
contemplates
that
oxidative
stress
is
the
important
mechanisms
involved
in
cypermethrin-induced
toxicity
and
the
oxidative
insult
produced
by
dermal
route
is
more

The
aim
of
this

was
to
investigate
the
involvement

)
in
haemorrhagic

,
the

injection
of
cyclophosphamide
(
three
doses
of
100mg
/

,
every
other
day
,
in
a
total
of
five
days
)
.

This
treatment
was
followed

the
treatment
with

HC

(

)
.

The
threshold
for
hindpaw

or
abdominal

to
von

Hair
and
the
locomotor
activity
were
measured
.

The
treatment
with
the
TRPA1
antagonist
HC
030031
significantly
decreased
mechanical
hyperalgesia
induced
by
cyclophosphamide
without
interfere
with
locomotor
activity
.

Urodynamic
parameters
were
performed
by
cystometry
24h
after
a
single
treatment
with
cyclophosphamide
(
200mg

i
.

p
.

)
in
control
and
HC
030031
treated
rats
.

Analyses
of
the
urodynamic
parameters
showed
that
a
single
dose
of
cyclophosphamide
was
enough
to
significantly
increase
the
number
and
amplitude
of
non-voiding
contractions
and
to
decrease
the
voided
volume
and
voiding
efficiency
,
without
significantly
altering
basal
,
threshold
or
maximum
pressure
.

The
treatment
with
HC
030031
either
before
(
100mg

,
p
.

o
.

)
or
after
(
30mg
/

,
i
.

v
.

)
cyclophosphamide
inhibited
the
non-voiding
contractions
but
failed
to
counteract
the
loss
in
voiding
efficiency
.

Our
data
demonstrates
that
nociceptive
symptoms
and
urinary
bladder
overactivity
caused
by
cyclophosphamide
,
in
part
,
are
dependent
upon
the
activation
of
TRPA1
.

In
this
context
,
the
antagonism
of
the
receptor
may
be
an
alternative
to
minimise
the
urotoxic
symptoms
caused
by
this
chemotherapeutic
agent
.
In
mammalian
cells
,
phosphatidylserine
(
PtdSer
)
is
synthesized
through
the
action
of
the
endoplasmic
reticulum
enzymes
,
PtdSer
synthase
1
and
2
,
and
the
decarboxylation
of
PtdSer
accounts
for
the
majority
of
phosphatidylethanolamine
(
PtdEtn
)
synthesis
.

PtdSer
decarboxylation
for
PtdEtn
formation
occurs
in
the
mitochondria
.

In
addition
,
the
transport
of
PtdSer
from
the
endoplasmic
reticulum
to
the
mitochondria
is
probably
a
rate
limiting
step
for
PtdEtn
synthesis
through
the
decarboxylation
pathway
.

Therefore
,
the
regulation
of
PtdSer
synthesis
and
its
intracellular
transport
appear
to
be
essential
events
for
the
maintenance
of
normal
cellular
PtdSer
and
PtdEtn
levels
.

Here
we
describe
the
current
understanding
of
the
regulation
of
PtdSer
biosynthesis
and
the
transport
of
PtdSer
from
the

to

ABSTRACT
TRUNCATED
AT
250
WORDS
)
Rapamycin
is
a
canonical
allosteric
inhibitor
of
the
mTOR
kinase
with
immunosuppressive
and
pro-apoptotic
activities
.

We
found
that
in
vitro
rapamycin
also
regulates
the
proteasome
,
an
essential
intracellular
protease
of
the
ubiquitin-proteasome
pathway
.

Rapamycin
inhibits
proteinase
and
selected
peptidase
activities
of
the
catalytic
core
proteasome
at
low
micromolar
concentrations
.

Moreover
,
the
drug
interferes
with
binding
of
the
19S
cap
essential
for
processing
of
polyubiquitinylated
substrates
,
and
the
PA200
activator
to
the
20S
catalytic
core
proteasome
.

These
protein
complexes
are
known
to
bind
to
specific
grooves
on
the
α
face
region
of
the
20S
core
.

A
treatment
with
rapamycin
affects
conformational
dynamics
of
the
proteasomal
gate
,
a
centrally
positioned
within
the
α
face
and
allosterically
regulated
element
responsible
for
the
intake
of
substrates
.

Interestingly
,
we
showed
that
rapamycin
shares
all
the
proteasome
targeting
properties
not
only
with
other
two-domain
,
closed-ring
analogs
(
rapalogs
)
,
but
also
with
its
single
domain
mimics
,
and
with
seco-rapamycin
.

The
latter
is
the
first
in
vivo
open-ring
metabolite
of
rapamycin
that
does
not
affect
mTOR
.

We
hypothesize
that
the
rapamycin
and
related
compounds
bind
to
the
α
face
and
allosterically
impact
the
proteasome
function
.

The
implications
of
our
finding
for
mechanism
of
in
vivo
actions
of
rapamycin
and
for
design
of
novel
allosteric
drugs
targeting
the
proteasome
are
discussed
.

The
molecular
mechanism
for
the
anti-inflammatory
action
of
theophylline
is
currently
unknown
,
but
low-dose
theophylline
is
an
effective
add-on
therapy
to
corticosteroids
in
controlling
asthma
.

Corticosteroids
act
,
at
least
in
part
,
by
recruitment
of
histone
deacetylases
(
HDACs
)
to
the
site
of
active
inflammatory
gene
transcription
.

They
thereby
inhibit
the
acetylation
of
core
histones
that
is
necessary
for
inflammatory
gene
transcription
.

We
show
both
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
that
low-dose
theophylline
enhances
HDAC
activity
in
epithelial
cells
and
macrophages
.

This
increased
HDAC
activity
is
then
available
for
corticosteroid
recruitment
and
predicts
a
cooperative
interaction
between
corticosteroids
and
theophylline
.

This
mechanism
occurs
at
therapeutic
concentrations
of
theophylline
and
is
dissociated
from
phosphodiesterase
inhibition
(
the
mechanism
of
bronchodilation
)
or
the
blockade
of
adenosine
receptors
,
which
are
partially
responsible
for
its
side
effects
.

Thus
we
have
shown
that
low-dose
theophylline
exerts
an
anti-asthma
effect
through
increasing
activation
of
HDAC
which
is
subsequently
recruited
by
corticosteroids
to
suppress
inflammatory
genes
.

Cardiac
hypertrophy
is
the
main
response
of
the
heart
to
various
extrinsic
and
intrinsic
stimuli
,
and
it
is
characterized
by
specific
molecular
and
phenotypic
changes
.

Recent
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
studies
indicate
the
involvement
of
reactive
oxygen
species
in
the
hypertrophic
response
.

In
this
study
,
silibinin
,
a
plant
flavonolignan
extracted
from
milk
thistle
with
potent
antioxidant
activity
,
was
evaluated
for
its
effects
in
(
a
)
preventing
hydrogen
peroxide
(
H2O2
)
-induced
cellular
damage
and
(
b
)
blocking
the
phenylephrine-induced
hypertrophic
response
.

Using
the
in
vitro
model
of
embryonic
rat
heart-derived
H9c2
cells
,
we
showed
that
silibinin
has
a
rather
safe
profile
as
concentrations
up
to
200μM
did
not
affect
cell
viability
.

Pretreatment
of
H9c2
cells
with
silibinin
resulted
in
better
protection
of
H9c2
cells
under
conditions
of
H2O2-induced
cellular
stress
compared
to
untreated
cells
as
indicated
by
cell
viability
and
DNA
fragmentation
assays
.

Furthermore
,
silibinin
attenuated
the
phenylephrine-induced
hypertrophic
response
as
evidenced
by
the
measurement
of
cell
surface
,
up-regulation
of
atrial
natriuretic
peptide
and
increase
of
cellular
protein
levels
.

Moreover
,
silibinin
repressed
the
phenylephrine-induced
phosphorylation
of
ERK1
/
2
kinases
,
while
it
appeared
to
inhibit
the
weakly
activated
by
phenylephrine
phosphorylation
of
Akt
.

Based
on
our
results
,
silibinin
may
attenuate
the
phenylephrine-induced
hypertrophic
response
of
H9c2
cells
via
antioxidant
mechanisms
involving
mainly
the
inhibition
of
the
intracellular
signaling
pathways
mediated
by
ERK1
/
2
MAPKs
and
Akt
.
OBJECTIVE
:
We
measured
efflux
from
macrophages
to
apolipoprotein
B-depleted
serum
from
263
specimens
and
found
instances
in
which
serum
having
similar
high-density
lipoprotein
cholesterol
(
HDL-C
)
differed
in
their
efflux
capacity
.

Thus
,
we
wanted
to
elucidate
why
efflux
capacity
could
be
independent
of
total
HDL-C
or
apolipoprotein
A-I
(
apoA-I
)
.

METHODS
AND
RESULTS
:
To
understand
why
sera
with
similar
HDL-C
or
apoA-I
could
differ
in
total
efflux
capacity
,
we
assessed
their
ability
to
promote
efflux
via
the
pathways
expressed
in
cAMP-treated
J774
macrophages
.

Briefly
,
macrophages
were
preincubated
with
probucol
to
block
ABCA1
,
with
BLT-1
to
block
SR-BI
,
and
with
both
inhibitors
to
measure
residual
efflux
.

ABCG1
efflux
was
measured
with
transfected
BHK-1
cells
.

We
used
apolipoprotein
B-depleted
serum
from
specimens
with
similar
HDL-C
values
at
the
25
(
th
)
and
75
(
th
)
percentiles
.

Specimens
in
each
group
were
classified
as
having
high
or
low
efflux
based
on
total
efflux
being
above
or
below
the
group
average
.

We
found
that
independently
of
HDL-C
,
sera
with
higher
efflux
capacity
had
a
significant
increase
in
ABCA1-mediated
efflux
,
which
was
significantly
correlated
to
the
concentration
of
pre
beta-1
HDL
.

The
same
result
was
obtained
when
these
sera
were
similarly
analyzed
based
on
similar
apoA-I
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
Sera
with
similar
HDL-C
or
apoA-I
differ
in
their
ability
to
promote
macrophage
efflux
because
of
differences
in
the
concentration
of
pre
beta-1
HDL
.

Reduced
synthesis
of
nitric
oxide
(
NO
)
contributes
to
the
endothelial
dysfunction
and
may
be
related
to
limited
availability
of
L-arginine
,
the
common
substrate
of
constitutive
nitric-oxide
synthase
(
NOS
)
and
cytosolic
arginase
I
and
mitochondrial
arginase
II
.

To
determine
whether
arginases
modulate
the
endothelial
NO
synthesis
,
we
investigated
the
effects
of
the
competitive
arginase
inhibitor
N
(
omega
)
-hydroxy-nor-L-arginine
(
Nor-NOHA
)
on
the
activity
of
NOS
,
arginases
,
and
L-arginine
transporter
and
on
NO
release
at
surface
of
human
umbilical
vein
endothelial
cells
(
HUVECs
)
.

In
unstimulated
cells
,
Nor-NOHA
dose-dependently
reduced
the
arginase
activity
with
maximal
inhibition
at
20
microM
.

When
HUVECs
were
stimulated
by
thrombin
without
extracellular
L-arginine
,
Nor-NOHA
dose-dependently
increased
the
NOS
activity
and
the
NO
release
with
maximal
effects
at
20
microM
.

Extracellular
L-arginine
also
dose-dependently
increased
NO
release
and
arginase
activity
.

When
HUVECs
were
stimulated
by
thrombin
in
the
presence
of
100
microM
L-arginine
,
NOS
activity
and
NO
release
were
similar
in
untreated
and
Nor-NOHA-treated
cells
.

However
,
despite
activation
of
L-arginine
uptake
,
the
inhibition
of
arginase
activity
by
Nor-NOHA
was
still
significant
.

The
depletion
of
freely
exchangeable
L-arginine
pools
with
extracellular
L-lysine
did
not
prevent
Nor-NOHA
from
increasing
the
NO
release
.

This
indicates
the
presence
of
pools
,
which
are
accessible
to
NOS
and
arginase
,
but
not
exchangeable
.

Interestingly
,
the
mitochondrial
arginase
II
was
constitutively
expressed
,
whereas
the
cytosolic
arginase
I
was
barely
detectable
in
HUVECs
.

These
data
suggest
that
endothelial
NO
synthesis
depends
on
the
activity
of
arginase
II
in
mitochondria
and
l-arginine
carriers
in
cell
membrane
.

PURPOSE
:
This
study
investigated
the
effectiveness
of
topiramate
(
TPM
)
as
an
inhibitor
of
six
isozymes
of
carbonic
anhydrase
(
CA
)
.

METHODS
:
The
inhibition
constants
(
Ki
)
of
TPM
and
acetazolamide
(
AZM
)
for
CA
I
,
CA
II
,
CA
III
,
CA
IV
,
CA
V
,
and
CA
VI
were
determined
for
human
(
HCA
)
,
rat
(
RCA
)
,
or
mouse
(
MCA
)
.

The
activity
of
CA
was
studied
by
using
purified
isozymes
,
erythrocytes
,
subcellular
fractions
of
kidney
or
brain
,
and
saliva
,
and
was
assayed
at
37
degrees
C
or
25
degrees
C
by
18O
mass
spectrometry
and
/
or
by
measuring
the
pH
shift
at
0
degrees
C
.

RESULTS
:
Topiramate
Ki
values
for
HCA
I
,
HCA
II
,
HCA
IV
,
and
HCA
VI
were
approximately
100
,
7
,
10
,
and
>100
microM
,
respectively
.

TPM
Ki
values
for
RCA
I
,
RCA
II
,
RCA
III
,
RCA
IV
,
and
RCA
V
were
approximately
180
,
0
.
1
to
1
,
>100
,
0
.
2
to
10
and
18
microM
,
respectively
.

For
RCA
II
and
RCA
IV
,
the
Ki
values
were
temperature
dependent
.

TPM
Ki
values
for
MCA
II
and
MCA
IV
ranged
between
1
and
20
microM
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
These
results
indicate
that
TPM
is
more
potent
as
an
inhibitor
of
CA
II
and
CA
IV
than
of
CA
I
,
CA
III
,
and
CA
VI
.

In
all
three
species
,
AZM
was
usually
10
to
100
times
more
potent
than
TPM
as
an
inhibitor
of
CA
isozymes
.

A
large
body
of
evidence
supports
the
hypothesis
that
mesolimbic
dopamine
(
DA
)
mediates
,
in
animal
models
,
the
reinforcing
effects
of
central
nervous
system
stimulants
such
as
cocaine
and
amphetamine
.

The
role
DA
plays
in
mediating
amphetamine-type
subjective
effects
of
stimulants
in
humans
remains
to
be
established
.

Both
amphetamine
and
cocaine
increase
norepinephrine
(
NE
)
via
stimulation
of
release
and
inhibition
of
reuptake
,
respectively
.

If
increases
in
NE
mediate
amphetamine-type
subjective
effects
of
stimulants
in
humans
,
then
one
would
predict
that
stimulant
medications
that
produce
amphetamine-type
subjective
effects
in
humans
should
share
the
ability
to
increase
NE
.

To
test
this
hypothesis
,
we
determined
,
using
in
vitro
methods
,
the
neurochemical
mechanism
of
action
of
amphetamine
,
3
,
4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine
(
MDMA
)
,
(
+
)
-methamphetamine
,
ephedrine
,
phentermine
,
and
aminorex
.

As
expected
,
their
rank
order
of
potency
for
DA
release
was
similar
to
their
rank
order
of
potency
in
published
self-administration
studies
.

Interestingly
,
the
results
demonstrated
that
the
most
potent
effect
of
these
stimulants
is
to
release
NE
.

Importantly
,
the
oral
dose
of
these
stimulants
,
which
produce
amphetamine-type
subjective
effects
in
humans
,
correlated
with
the
their
potency
in
releasing
NE
,
not
DA
,
and
did
not
decrease
plasma
prolactin
,
an
effect
mediated
by
DA
release
.

These
results
suggest
that
NE
may
contribute
to
the
amphetamine-type
subjective
effects
of
stimulants
in
humans
.
In
view
of
evidence
that
neither
interindividual
nor
induced
intra-individual
variations
of
adrenergic
receptor
status
are
related
to
metabolic
or
haemodynamic
sensitivity
to
adrenaline
in
vivo
,
we
took
an
alternative
approach
to
assessment
of
the
relevance
of
adrenergic
receptor
measurement
by
measuring
these
in
a
group
of
subjects
with
well-documented
adrenergic
denervation
hypersensitivity
,
patients
with
diabetic
autonomic
neuropathy
.

Mononuclear
leukocyte
beta
2-adrenergic
receptor
densities
(
and
binding
affinities
)
,
measured
with
125I-labelled
pindolol
,
and
isoproterenol-stimulated
cyclic
AMP
accumulation
,
in
samples
from
patients
with
insulin-dependent
diabetes
mellitus
(
IDDM
)
with
diabetic
autonomic
neuropathy
(
n
=
8
)
,
were
no
different
from
those
in
samples
from
patients
with
IDDM
without
neuropathy
(
n
=
8
)
,
or
from
non-diabetic
subjects
(
n
=
8
)
.

In
addition
,
platelet
alpha
2-adrenergic
receptor
densities
(
and
binding
affinities
)
,
measured
with
3H-labelled
yohimbine
,
and
adrenaline-induced
suppression
of
cyclic
AMP
contents
did
not
differ
among
the
three
groups
.

Thus
,
in
contrast
to
idiopathic
autonomic
failure
,
there
is
no
generalized
increase
in
adrenergic
receptors
in
autonomic
failure
due
to
diabetic
autonomic
neuropathy
.

Regardless
of
the
mechanism
of
adrenergic
denervation
hypersensitivity
in
such
patients
,
these
data
provide
further
evidence
that
measurements
of
cellular
adrenergic
receptors
(
and
adenylate
cyclase
)
in
vitro
are
a
fallible
index
of
sensitivity
to
catecholamines
in
vivo
.
Aggregation

(
α-syn
)
in

Occupational
and
environmental
exposure
to
manganese
(
Mn
)
is
associated
with
a
neurological
syndrome
consisting
of
psychiatric
symptoms
,
cognitive
impairment
and
parkinsonism
.

In
this
study
,
we
examined
α-syn
immunoreactivity
in
the
frontal
cortex
of
Cynomolgus
macaques
as
part
of
a
multidisciplinary
assessment
of
the
neurological
effects
produced
by
exposure
to
moderate
levels
of
Mn
.

We
found
increased
α-syn-positive
cells
in
the
gray
matter
of
Mn-exposed
animals
,
typically
observed
in
pyramidal
and
medium-sized
neurons
in
deep
cortical
layers
.

Some
of
these
neurons
displayed
loss
of
Nissl
staining
with
α-syn-positive
spherical
aggregates
.

In
the
white
matter
we
also
observed
α-syn-positive
glial
cells
and
in
some
cases
α-syn-positive
neurites
.

These
findings
suggest
that
Mn
exposure
promotes
α-syn
aggregation
in
neuronal
and
glial
cells
that
may
ultimately
lead
to
degeneration
in
the
frontal
cortex
gray
and
white
matter
.

To
our
knowledge
,
this
is
the
first
report
of
Mn-induced

α-syn

,
can
result
from
genetic
variants
in
one
(
or
more
)
of
the
genes
governing
cardiac
repolarization
as
well
as
intake
of
drugs
known
to
affect
a
cardiac
K
(
+
)
channel
encoded
by
human
ether-a-go-go-related
gene
(
HERG
)
.

In
this
paper
,
we
will
report
a
case
of
drug-induced
long
QT
syndrome
associated
with
an
H
(
1
)
-receptor
antagonist
,
hydroxyzine
,
in
which
a
mutation
was
identified
in
the
HERG
gene
.

After
taking
75
mg
of
hydroxyzine
for
several
days
,
a
34-year-old
female
began
to
experience
repetitive
syncope
.

The
deleterious
effect
of
hydroxyzine
was
suspected
because
QTc
interval
shortened
from
630
to
464
ms
after
cessation
of
the
drug
.

Later
on
,
the
patient
was
found
to
harbor
an
A614V-HERG
mutation
.

By
using
the
patch-clamp
technique
in
the
heterologous
expression
system
,
we
examined
the
functional
outcome
of
the
A614V
mutation
and
confirmed
a
dominant-negative
effect
on
HERG
expression
.

Hydroxyzine
concentration-dependently
inhibited
both
wild-type
(
WT
)
and
WT
/
A614V-HERG
K
(
+
)
currents
.

Half-maximum
block
concentrations
of
WT
and
WT
/
A614V-HERG
K
(
+
)
currents
were
0
.
62
and
0
.
52
microM
,
respectively
.

Thus
,
accidental
combination
of
genetic
mutation
and
intake
of
hydroxyzine
appeared
to
have
led
to
a
severe
phenotype
,
probably
,
syncope
due
to

Accumulating
evidence
points
to
a
causal
role
for
advanced
glycation
end
products
(
AGEs
)
in
the
development
of
diabetic
vascular
complications
,
including
retinopathy
.

Possible
pathogenic
mechanisms
linking
AGEs
to
diabetic
retinopathy
include
protein
kinase
C
(
PKC
)
activation
,
oxidative
stress
,
and
vascular
endothelial
growth
factor
(
VEGF
)
expression
.

In
the
present
study
,
we
investigated
the
effect
of
AGEs
on
VEGF
expression
in
bovine
retinal
endothelial
cells
(
BRECs
)
and
determined
the
role
of
PKC
and
oxidative
stress
in
this
effect
.

Incubation
of
BRECs
with
AGEs
led
to
enhanced
VEGF
mRNA
and
protein
expression
.

This
treatment
also
induced
PKC
translocation
in
these
cells
.

The
AGE-induced
increases
in
VEGF
expression
and
PKC
activation
were
inhibited
by
the
pan-specific
PKC
inhibitor
,
calphostin
C
,
and
by
the
antioxidant
drug
and
compounds
,
gliclazide
,
N-acetylcysteine
,
and
vitamin
E
.

In
contrast
,
glyburide
which
does
not
exhibit
antioxidant
properties
,
did
not
affect
the
AGE-induced
VEGF
expression
.

Exposure
of
BRECs
to
AGEs
resulted
in
a
significant
increase
of
nuclear
protein
binding
to
the
NF-kappa
B
consensus
sequence
of
the
VEGF
promoter
region
.

Induction
of
DNA
binding
activity
for
NF-kappa
B
by
AGEs
was
prevented
by
gliclazide
.

Treatment
of
BRECs
with
AGEs
also
increased
the
proliferation
of
these
cells
.

This
effect
was
abrogated
by
incubating
the
cells
with
an
anti-VEGF
antibody
and
was
inhibited
in
the
presence
of
gliclazide
.

Overall
,
these
data
demonstrate
that
AGEs
increase
VEGF
expression
in
retinal
endothelial
cells
through
generation
of
oxidative
stress
and
downstream
activation
of
the
PKC
pathway
.

Targeting
VEGF
expression
with
specific
pharmacological
agents
,
such
as
antioxidants
and
PKC
inhibitors
,
may
prove
efficacious
for
the
treatment
of
diabetic
retinopathy
.
Phytoestrogens
(
PEs
)
are
naturally
occurring
plant

Single
isoflavones
have
been
shown
to
affect
adipocyte
differentiation
,
but
knowledge
on
the
effect
of
dietary
relevant
mixtures
of
PEs
,
including
for
instance
lignans
,
is
lacking
.

In
the
current
study
dietary
relevant
mixtures
of
isoflavones
and
their
metabolites
,
lignans
and
their
metabolites
,
coumestrol
,
and
a
mixture
containing
all
of
them
,
were
examined
for
effects
on
adipogenesis
in
3T3-L1
adipocytes
,
as
well
as
tested
for
their
PPARγ
activating
abilities
.

The
results
showed
that
mixtures
of
isoflavonoid
parent
compounds
and
metabolites
,
respectively
,
a
mixture
of
lignan
metabolites
,
as
well
as
coumestrol
concentration-dependently
inhibited
adipocyte
differentiation
.

Furthermore
,
a
mixture
of
isoflavonoid
parent
compounds
,
and
a
mixture
of
isoflavonoid
metabolites
were
found
to
have
PPARγ
activating
abilities
.

These
results
suggest
that
PEs
can
affect
pathways
known
to
play
a
role
in
obesity
development
,
and
indicate
that
the
inhibitory
effect
on
adipocyte
differentiation
does
not
appear
to
be
strictly
associated
with
PPARγ
activation
/
inhibition
.

The
current
study
support
the
hypothesis
that
compounds
with
endocrine
activity
can
affect
pathways
playing
a
role
in
the

were
found
to
function
as

The

was
decreased
by

Studies
assessing
the
impact
of
epilepsy
and
its
medication
on
the
risk
of
road
traffic
crashes
have
shown
inconsistent
results
.

The
aim
in
this
study
was
to
assess
this
risk
using
French
databases
.

Data
from
three
French
national
databases
were
extracted
and
matched
:
the
national
health
care
insurance
database
,
police
reports
,
and
the
national
police
database
of
injurious
crashes
.

Only
antiepileptics
prescribed
predominantly
in
epilepsy
were
studied
(
phenobarbital
,
phenytoin
,
ethosuximide
,
valproic
acid
,
vigabatrin
,
tiagabin
,
levitiracetam
,
zonisamide
,
and
lacosamide
)
.

A
case-control
analysis
comparing
responsible
and
non-responsible
drivers
and
a
case-crossover
analysis
were
performed
.

Drivers
(
72
685
)
involved
in
an
injurious
crash
in
France
between
July
2005
and
May
2008
,
were
included
.

Drivers
exposed
to
prescribed
antiepileptic
medicines
(
n
=
251
)
had
an
increased
risk
of
being
responsible
for
a
crash
(
OR

.
74
[

.
29-2
.

]
)
.

The
association
was
also
significant
for
the
most
severe
epileptic
patients
(
n
=
99;
OR
=
2
.
20
[

.
31-3
.

]
)
.

Case-crossover
analysis
found
no
association
between
crash
risk
and
treatment
prescription
.

Patients
with
prescription
of
antiepileptic
drugs
should
be
cautioned
about
their
potential
risk
of
road
traffic
crash
.

This
risk
is
however
more
likely
to
be
related
to
seizures
than
to
the
effect
of
antiepileptic
medicines

OBJECTIVE
:
The
metabolic
syndrome
(
MetS
)
is
an
increasing
epidemiologic
challenge
and
cardiovascular
risk
factor
.

Interleukin-6
(
IL-6
)
is
a
cytokine
that
exerts
its
biological
function
via
a
complex
orchestration
of
soluble
and
membrane
bound
receptors
.

We
have
investigated
associations
between
IL-6
and
its
soluble
receptors
,
soluble
IL-6
receptor
(
sIL-6r
)
and
soluble
glycoprotein
130
(
sGP130
)
and
the
metabolic
syndrome
.

Furthermore
,
we
have
investigated
possible
associations
with
endothelial
dysfunction
and
arterial
stiffness
.

METHODS
:
A
total
of
563
subjects
were
included
in
this
study
.

The
Adult
Treatment
Panel
III
criteria
of
the
National
Cholesterol
Education
Program
were
used
for
the
definition
of
MetS
.

We
used
commercially
available
ELISA
to
analyse
circulating
levels
of
the
markers
.

Pulse
wave
propagation
time
(
PWP
)
was
determined
to
assess
arterial
stiffness
.

RESULTS
:
The
criteria
for
having
MetS
were
filled
by
221
subjects
.

sGP130
,
sIL-6r
and
IL-6
levels
were
elevated
in
subjects
with
MetS
(
p<0
.
05
for
all
markers
)
,
and
are
associated
with
increasing
components
of
MetS
.

Particularly
hypertriglyceridaemia
,
hypertension
and
fasting
plasma
glucose
(
FPG
)
seem
to
carry
this
association
.

sGP130
(
p<0
.
01
)
,
IL-6
(
p<0
.
05
)
and
partially
sIL-6r
(
p<0
.
05
)
correlated
with
markers
of
endothelial
function
(
E-selectin
,
I-CAM-1
,
V-CAM-1
)
and
inversely
with
PWP
after
adjustment
for
relevant
covariates
.

CONCLUSION
:
sGP130
,
sIL-6r
and
IL-6
were
significantly
elevated
in
subjects
with
MetS
.

In
addition
,
sGP130
,
IL-6
and
partially
sIL-6r
were
associated
with
markers
of
endothelial
function
and
arterial
stiffness
.

This
finding
sheds
new
light
on
the
role
of
these
inflammatory
cytokines
in
subjects
with
MetS
and
the
development
and
progression
of
clinically
silent
atherosclerosis

A
fourth
member
of
the
diacylglycerol
kinase
(
DGK
)
gene
family
termed
DGK
delta
was
cloned
from
the
human
testis
cDNA
library
.

The
cDNA
sequence
contains
an
open
reading
frame
of
3
,
507
nucleotides
encoding
a
putative
DGK
protein
of
130
,
006
Da
.

Interestingly
,
the
new
DGK
isozyme
contains
a
pleckstrin
homology
domain
found
in
a
number
of
proteins
involved
in
signal
transduction
.

Furthermore
,
the
C-terminal
tail
of
this
isozyme
is
very
similar
to
those
of
the
EPH
family
of
receptor
tyrosine
kinases
.

The
primary
structure
of
the
delta-isozyme
also
has
two
cysteine-rich
zinc
finger-like
structures
(
C3
region
)
and
the
C-terminal
C4
region
,
both
of
which
have
been
commonly
found
in
the
three
isozymes
previously
cloned
(
DGKs
alpha
,
beta
and
gamma
)
.

However
,
DGK
delta
lacks
the
EF-hand
motifs
(
C2
)
and
contains
a
long
Glu-
and
Ser-rich
insertion
(
317
residues
)
,
which
divides
the
C4
region
into
two
portions
.

Taken
together
,
these
structural
features
of
DGK
delta
indicate
that
this
isozyme
belongs
to
a
DGK
subfamily
distinct
from
that
consisting
of
DGKs
alpha
,
beta
,
and
gamma
.

Increased
DGK
activity
without
marked
preference
to
arachidonoyl
type
of
diacylglycerol
was
detected
in
the
particulate
fraction
of
COS-7
cells
expressing
the
transfected
DGKdelta
cDNA
.

The
enzyme
activity
was
independent
of
phosphatidylserine
,
which
is
a
common
activator
for
the
previously
sequenced
DGKs
.

Northern
blot
analysis
showed
that
the
DGK
delta
mRNA
(
approximately
6
.
3
kilobases
)
is
most
abundant
in
human
skeletal
muscle
but
undetectable
in
the
brain
,
thymus
,
and
retina
.

This
expression
pattern
is
different
from
those
of
the
previously
cloned
DGKs
.

Our
results
show
that
the
DGK
gene
family
consists
of
at
least
two
subfamilies
consisting
of
enzymes
with
distinct
structural
characteristics
and
that
each
cell
type
probably
expresses
its
own
characteristic
repertoire
of
DGKs
whose
functions
may
be
regulated
through
different
signal
transduction
pathways
.
A
biological

was
performed
to
establish
the

of
red

collected
at
several
sites
along
the
Spanish
Mediterranean
coast
by
testing
male
fish
bile
extracts
using
the
in

ER-LUC
reporter
gene
assay
.

In
addition
,
major
metabolites
were
identified
and
measurements
of
OH-PAHs
(
1-naphthol
,
9-phenantrol
,
9-fluorenol
,

,
1OH-BaP
and

)
and
alkylphenols
(
4-n-nonylphenol
(
4-n-NP
)
and
4-tertoctylphenol
(
4-tert-OP
)
)
in
the
same
fish
bile
extracts
were
taken
by
gas

in
electron
ionization
mode
(
GC-EI-MS
)
.

Relative
in

estrogenic
potencies
of
the
chemically
quantified
compounds
were
also
tested
.

The
highest
biliary
concentrations
of
1-pyrenol
,
9-fluorenol
and
4-n-NP
were
found
in
fish
from
Barcelona
and
from
the
Mar
Menor
coastal
lagoon
.

However
,
these
concentrations
can
be
considered
relatively
low
compared
to
values
reported
in
red
mullet
from
other
polluted
waters
in
the
Mediterranean
Sea
.

The
contribution
of
1-pyrenol
,
4-n-NP
and
4-tert-OP
to
the
total
estrogenic
potency
measured
in
male
fish
bile
was
found
to
be
negligible
,
indicating
the
presence
of
other
estrogenic
compounds
in
red
mullet
bile
.

Estrogenic
potency
in
bile
from
male
fish
was
markedly
elevated
in
Mar
Menor
lagoon
(
234

)
,
and
further
research
will
be
necessary
to
explain
whether
the
presence
of
natural
and
synthetic-hormones
in
the
lagoon
contributed
to
this
finding
.

Values
of
approximately
15-16E2EQpg

can
be
regarded
as
preliminary
baseline
levels
of

ACTH
has
been
shown
to
stimulate
androgen
production
by
the
fetal
/
neonatal
mouse
testis
through
the
melanocortin
type
2
receptor
(
MC2R
)
.

This
study
was
designed
to
localize
the
expression
of
MC2R
in
the
neonatal
mouse
testis
and
characterize
the
effects
of
ACTH
on
testicular
androgen
production
.

Using
immunohistochemistry
,
MC2R
was
localized
to
the
fetal-type
Leydig
cell
population
of
the
neonatal
testis
.

ACTH
caused
a
time-dependent
increase
in
cyclic
AMP
(
cAMP
)
and
testosterone
production
by
isolated
cells
with
an
increase
in
cAMP
apparent
in
<
3
min
.

There
was
no
additive
effect
of
maximally
stimulating
doses
of
ACTH
and
human
chorionic
gonadotropin
(
hCG
)
.

Androgen
production
in
response
to
ACTH
and
hCG
was
reduced
by
UO126
and
dexamethasone
,
which
are
the
inhibitors
of
ERK1
/
2
and
phospholipase
A2
respectively
.

Expression
of
mRNA
encoding
StAR
was
increased
fourfold
by
both
ACTH
and
hCG
,
although
expression
of
mRNA
encoding
for
steroidogenic
enzymes
was
not
markedly
affected
.

The
potency
of
N-terminal
fragments
of
ACTH
to
stimulate
androgen
production
was
similar
to
that
seen
previously
in
the
adrenal
.

Data
indicate
that
both
LH
and
ACTH
,
acting
through
their
respective
receptors
,
stimulate
steroidogenesis
by
fetal-type
Leydig
cells
via
arachidonic

Hepatic
gluconeogenesis

.

Our
previous
study
indicated
that
areca
nut
extract
enriched
with
catechin-based
procyanidins
from
oligomers
to
polymers
gave
rise
to
anti-inflammatory
effects
in

.

Here
we
have
surveyed
the

(
ANPs
)
using
quadrupole

)
and
the
resulting

accurately
described

Furthermore
,
the
potential
of
ANP
in

homeostasis
was
explored
using
cyclic
adenosine

cAMP
)
/
dexamethasone
stimulated
primary
mouse
hepatocytes
and
multiple
low
dose
streptozocin
(
MLD-STZ
)
treated
mice
.

With
the
primary
hepatocytes
,
ANP
dose-dependently
inhibited
gluconeogenesis
and
reduced
the
mRNA
expression
of
two
gluconeogenic
key
enzymes
,
phosphoenol-pyruvate
carboxykinase
(
PEPCK
)
and
glucose-6-phosphatase
(
G6Pase
)
.

Intragastrically
feeding
of
10mg

ANP
for
4weeks
reduced
the
levels
of
fasting
blood
glucose
,
PEPCK
and

in
MLD-STZ
mice
.

In
additional
,
the
level
of

(
AMPK
)
expression
showed
a
trend
towards
being
restored
in

that
ANP
has
the
potential
to
improve
hyperglycemia
by
regulating

To

biological
and
catalytic

the

The

As

has
a

sodium-dependent
component
and
a

.

At
the
basolateral

,
arginine
transport
was

The

strictly
depended
on

Although
disturbed

function
often
coexists

psychosis
,
the
cognitive
effects
of
antipsychotic

properties
are
rarely
investigated
.

The
neurocognitive
profile
of
zuclopenthixol
,
a
thioxanthene
dopaminergic
antagonist
and
a
conventional
neuroleptic
agent
,
has
yet
to
be
investigated
despite
the
effect
of
the
drug
on
a
variety
of
neurotransmitter
systems
involved
in
mediation
of
learning
and
memory
processes
.

In
this
study
,
the
effect
of
zuclopenthixol
was
tested
on
memory
retrieval
24
h
after
training
using
an
inhibitory
avoidance
task
in
rats
.

)

retrieval
testing

session

The
same
doses
of
zuclopenthixol
did
not
affect
the
ambulatory
activity
of
rats
in
the
openfield
test
and
therefore
the
facilitatory
effect
of
the
drug
on
memory
function
could
not
be
confounded
with
any
motoric
properties
.

This
study
also
investigated
the
effect
of
zuclopenthixol
on
cortical
and
hippocampal
monoaminergic
neurotransmitters'
levels
together
with
acetylcholinesterase
enzyme
(
AChE
)
activity
,
both
of
which
are
known
to
be
important
in
control
of

)
neither
affected
dopamine
(

level
nor
AChE
activity
in

.

On
the
other
hand
,
the
lower
dose
of
zuclopenthixol
elevated
cortical
norepinephrine
(
NE
)
level
,
while
the
higher
dose
elevated
both
cortical
and
hippocampal
NE
level
together
with
hippocampal
serotonin
(
5-HT
)
level
.

These
results
may
suggest
the
involvement
of
adrenergic
and
serotonergic
mechanisms
in
the
facilitatory
effect
of
zuclopenthixol
on
retrieval
memory
.

Zuclopenthixol
may
therefore
be
a
better
alternative
than
other
commonly
used
antipsychotic
medications
reported
to
impair
cognitive
function
of
schizophrenic
patients

Sirtuins
are
also
evolutionarily
conserved
proteins
that
are
present
in
all
kingdoms
of
life
ranging
from
bacteria
to
humans
.

Interestingly
,
it
was
recently
found
that
the
sirtuins
found
in
various
human
parasites
(
especially
the
Plasmodium
,
Trypanosoma
,
and
Leishmania
species
)
were
pro-survival
for
the
parasites
under
various
conditions
.

Therefore
,
these
parasitic
sirtuins
have
emerged
as
novel
anti-parasitic
therapeutic
targets
.

This
article
reviews
the
currently
available
structural
,

,
pharmacological
,
and

studies
on
these

,
and
discusses
the
perspectives
of
selectively

the
parasitic
sirtuins
as
a
novel
therapeutic
strategy
for
the
human
parasitic
diseases

A
new
intermediate
resolution
model
for
phospholipids
,
LIME
,
designed
for
use
with
discontinuous
molecular
dynamics
(
DMD
)
simulations
is
presented
.

The
implicit-solvent
model
was
developed
using
a
multiscale
modeling
approach
in
which
the
geometric
and
energetic
parameters
are
obtained
by
collecting
data
from
atomistic
simulations
of
a
system
composed
of
1
,
2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine
(
DPPC
)
molecules
and
explicit
water
.

In
the
model
,
14
coarse-grained
sites
that
are
classified
as
1
of
6
types
represent
DPPC
.

DMD
simulations
performed
on
a
random
solution
of
DPPC
resulted
in
the
formation
of
a
defect-free
bilayer
in
less
than
4
h
.

The
bilayer
formed
quantitatively

Fat
infiltration
within
muscle
is
one
of
a
number
of
features
of
vitamin
D
deficiency
,
which
leads
to
a
decline
in
muscle
functionality
.

The
origin
of
this
fat
is
unclear
,
but
one
possibility
is
that
it
forms
from
myogenic
precursor
cells
present
in
the
muscle
,
which
transdifferentiate
into
mature
adipocytes
.

The
current
study
examined
the
effect
of
the
active
form
of
vitamin
D₃
,
1
,
25-dihydroxyvitamin
D₃
(
1
,
25
(

)
,
on
the
capacity
of
the
C2C12
muscle
cell
line
to
differentiate
towards
the
myogenic
and
adipogenic
lineages
.

Cells
were
cultured
in
myogenic
or
adipogenic
differentiation
media
containing
increasing
concentrations
(
0
,
10⁻¹³
,
10⁻¹¹
,
10⁻⁹
,
10⁻⁷
or
10⁻⁵
M
)
of
1
,
25
(
OH
)
₂D₃
for
up
to
6
days
and
markers
of
muscle
and
fat
development
measured
.

Mature
myofibres
were
formed
in
both
adipogenic
and
myogenic
media
,
but
fat
droplets
were
only
observed
in
adipogenic
media
.

Relative
to
controls
,
low
physiological
concentrations
(
10⁻¹³
and
10⁻¹¹
M
)
of
1
,
25
(
OH
)
₂D3
increased
fat
droplet
accumulation
,
whereas
high
physiological
(
10⁻⁹
M
)
and
supraphysiological
concentrations
(
≥10⁻⁷
M
)
inhibited
fat
accumulation
.

This
increased
accumulation
of
fat
with
low
physiological
concentrations
(
10⁻¹³
and
10⁻¹¹
M
)
was
associated
with
a
sequential
up-regulation
of
PPARγ2
(
PPARG
)
and
FABP4
mRNA
,
indicating
formation
of
adipocytes
,
whereas
higher
concentrations
(
≥10⁻⁹
M
)
reduced
all
these
effects
,
and
the
highest
concentration
(
10⁻⁵
M
)
appeared
to
have
toxic
effects
.

This
is
the
first
study
to
demonstrate
dose-dependent
effects
of
1
,
25
(
OH
)
₂D₃
on
the
transdifferentiation
of
muscle
cells
into
adipose
cells
.

Low
physiological
concentrations
(
possibly
mimicking
a
deficient
state
)
induced
adipogenesis
,
whereas
higher
(
physiological
and
supraphysiological
)
concentrations
attenuated
this
effect
.
Valine
residues
in
the
pore
region
of
SK2
(
V366
)
and
SK3
(
V520
)
were
replaced
by
either
an
alanine
or
a
phenylalanine
to
evaluate
the
impact
on
the
interactions
with
the
allosteric
blocker
apamin
.

Unlike
TEA
which
showed
high
sensitivity
to
phenylalanine
mutated
channels
,
the
binding
affinity
of
apamin
to
the
phenylalanine
mutants
was
strongly
reduced
.

In
addition
,
currents
from
phenylalanine
mutants
were
largely
resistant
to
block
by
apamin
.

On
the
other
hand
,
when
the
valine
residue
was
replaced
by
an
alanine
residue
,
an
increase
of
the
binding
affinity
and
the
amount
of
block
by
apamin
was
observed
for
alanine
mutated
SK2
channels
,
but
not
for
mutated
SK3
channels
.

Interestingly
,
the
VA
mutation
reduced
the
sensitivity
to
TEA
.

In
silico
data
confirmed
these
experimental
results
.

Therefore
,
such
mutations
in
the
pore
region
of
SK
channels
show
that
the
three-dimensional
structure
of
the
SK
tetramers
can
be
disorganized
in
the
outer
pore
region
leading
to
reduced
interaction
of
apamin

its
target

Baicalein
is
a
bioactive
flavonoid
that
is
widely
used
in
ancient
China
.

However
,
its
effects
on
the
most
common
primary
malignant
bone
tumor
,
osteosarcoma
,
remain
unknown
.

In
the
present
study
,
we
investigated
the
effects
of
baicalein
in
osteosarcoma
cells
.

Our
results
indicate
baicalein
might
be
an
efficacious
anti-osteosarcoma
drug
.

We
found
that
baicalein
could
inhibit
cell
proliferation
in
a
time-
and
dose-dependent
manner
.

Additionally
,
we
demonstrated
that
baicalein
promotes
osteosarcoma
cell
apoptosis
,
and
our
mechanistic
studies
suggest
that
this
is
mediated
by
caspase
activation
,
especially
caspase-3
.

We
also
showed
that
the
down-regulation
of
Bcl-2
and
concurrent
increase
in
Bax
and
Bim
levels
contribute
to
the
apoptosis
induced
by
baicalein
.

In
addition
,
we
observed
that
baicalein
induces
G1
cell
cycle
arrest
by
decreasing
cyclin
D1
and
cyclin-dependent
kinase
4
(
CDK4
)
.

Furthermore
,
our
data
verifies
that
baicalein
can
reduce
osteosarcoma
cell
adhesion
,
migration
and
invasion
in
vitro
,
which
indicates
its
potential
to
inhibit
osteosarcoma
metastasis
.

The
decrease
in
expression
of
matrix
metalloproteinases
(
MMP
)
-2
and
MMP-9
may
contribute
to
the
effects
of
baicalein
.

Taken
together
,
our
results
provide
evidence
that
baicalein
plays
important
roles
in
anti-osteosarcoma
therapy
,
and
thus
may
serve
as
a
novel
and
efficient
candidate
agent
for
osteosarcoma
treatment
.
The
location
of
L-glutamate
decarboxylase
and
gamma-aminobutyrate
(
GABA
)
-transaminase
immunoreactivity
in
the
superior
cervical
ganglion
and
in
the
coeliac-superior
mesenteric
ganglion
complex
of
the
rat
was
studied
by
an
indirect
immunofluorescence
method
and
by
immunoelectron
microscopy
,
with
specific
antisera
raised
in
rabbits
against
the
corresponding
enzymes
.

In
light
microscopy
,
several
glutamate
decarboxylase-
or
GABA-transaminase-immunoreactive
principal
nerve
cells
were
detected
in
the
superior
cervical
ganglion
and
coeliac-superior
mesenteric
ganglion
complex
.

In
addition
,
numerous
small
cells
in
both
the
superior
cervical
ganglion
and
coeliac-superior
mesenteric
ganglion
complex
showed
intense
immunoreactivity
to
glutamate
decarboxylase
or
GABA-transaminase
.

The
small
cells
were
10-20
micron
in
diameter
and
resembled
in
size
and
morphology
the
small
intensely
fluorescent
cells
.

In
consecutive
sections
,
the
small
glutamate
decarboxylase-immunoreactive
cell
clusters
also
showed
immunoreactivity
to
tyrosine
hydroxylase
,
suggesting
that
these
cells
contain
the
enzymes
for
both
GABA
and
catecholamine
synthesis
.

In
the
superior
cervical
ganglion
and
in
the
coeliac-superior
mesenteric
ganglion
complex
,
GABA-transaminase
immunoreactivity
was
also
localized
in
fibre-like
processes
around
and
between
the
principal
nerve
cells
,
in
nerve
trunks
traversing
the
ganglia
,
and
around
or
in
close
contact
with
ganglionic
blood
vessels
.

Furthermore
,
GABA-transaminase
immunoreactivity
was
observed
in
fibre-like
structures
close
to
the
capsule
of
the
ganglia
.

Division
of
the
preganglionic
nerve
trunk
of
the
superior
cervical
ganglion
caused
no
detectable
change
in
GABA-transaminase
immunoreactivity
in
the
ganglion
.

In
immunoelectron
microscopy
of
the
superior
cervical
ganglion
,
GABA-transaminase
immunoreactivity
was
localized
in
nerve
fibres
in
association
with
neurotubules
.

A
large
number
of
GABA-transaminase
labelled
principal
nerve
cells
were
detected
,
containing
immunoreactivity
evenly
distributed
in
their
cytoplasm
.

GABA-transaminase
immunoreactivity
was
also
observed
in
satellite
cells
and
their
processes
in
the
superior
cervical
ganglion
.

The
present
immunocytochemical
results
provide
evidence
that
the
rat
sympathetic
ganglia
contain
an
intrinsic
neuronal
system
showing
histochemical
markers
for
GABA
synthesis
and
inactivation
,
but
its
functional
role
in
the
modulation
of
ganglionic
neurotransmission
remains
to
be
established
.

Bisoprolol
administration
(
1
X

mg
/
day
)
did
not
affect
lymphocyte

density
,
while
ICI
118
,
551
(
3
X
25
mg
/
day
)
increased
it
by
about
40%
.

Exercise
as
well
as
isoprenaline
infusion
caused
100%
increases
in
lymphocyte
beta
2-adrenoceptor
density;
these
increases
were
completely
abolished
by
ICI
118
,
551
,
but
not
affected
by
bisoprolol
.

ICI
118
,
551
markedly
attenuated
isoprenaline-induced
decrease
in

blood
pressure
,
but
did
not
affect
increase
in

pressure;
on
the
contrary
,
bisoprolol
inhibited
the
isoprenaline-evoked
increase
in
systolic
blood
pressure
,
but
did
not
affect
the
decrease
in
diastolic
blood
pressure
.

ICI
118
,
551
antagonized
the
isoprenaline-induced
tachycardia
much
more
potently
than
bisoprolol
,
while
bisoprolol
,
but
not
ICI
118
,
551
,
suppressed
exercise-induced
tachycardia
.

It
is
concluded
that
exercise-induced
tachycardia
is
mediated
by
cardiac
beta
1-adrenoceptor
stimulation
,
whereas
isoprenaline-induced
tachycardia
is
mediated
by
both
beta
1-
and

the
polymerization
of
the

in

G
protein
coupled
receptors
(
GPCRs
)
are
the
most
historically
successful
therapeutic
targets
.

Despite
this
success
there
are
many
important
aspects
of
GPCR
pharmacology
and
function
that
have
yet
to
be
exploited
to
their
full
therapeutic
potential
.

One
in
particular
that
has
been
gaining
attention
in
recent
times
is
that
of
GPCR
ligands
that
bind
to
allosteric
sites
on
the
receptor
distinct
from
the
orthosteric
site
of
the
endogenous
ligand
.

As
therapeutics
,
allosteric
ligands
possess
many
theoretical
advantages
over
their
orthosteric
counterparts
,
including
more
complex
modes
of
action
,
improved
safety
,
more
physiologically
appropriate
responses
,
better
target
selectivity
,
and
reduced
likelihood
of
desensitisation
and
tachyphylaxis
.

Despite
these
advantages
,
the
development
of
allosteric
ligands
is
often
difficult
from
a
medicinal
chemistry
standpoint
due
to
the
more
complex
challenge
of
identifying
allosteric
leads
and
their
often
flat
or
confusing
SAR
.

The
present
review
will
consider
the
advantages
and
challenges
associated
with
allosteric
GPCR
ligands
,
and
examine
how
the
particular
properties
of
these
ligands
may
be
exploited
to
uncover
the

potential

Interest
in
structure-based
G-protein-coupled

(
GPCR
)
ligand
discovery
is
huge
,
given
that
almost
30
%
of
all
approved
drugs
belong
to
this
category
of
active
compounds
.

The
GPCR
family
includes
the
dopamine
receptor
subtype
D2
(
D2DR
)
,
but
unfortunately--as
is
true
of
most
GPCRs--no
experimental
structures
are
available
for
these
receptors
.

In
this
publication
,
we
present
the
molecular
model
of
D2DR
based
on
the
previously
published
crystal
structure
of
the
dopamine
D3
receptor
(
D3DR
)

study

.

The
observed
binding
modes
and
receptor-ligand
interactions
provided
us
with
fresh
clues
about
how
to
optimize
selectivity
for
D2DR
receptors

The
aim
of
this

was
to
evaluate
the
predictive
value
of
five
different
biological
factors
in
breast
cancer
patients
treated
with
neoadjuvant
anthracycline-based
chemotherapy
:

119
patients
with

breast
cancer
were
treated
with

.

Tumour
response
was
assessed
clinically
and
by
computed

)
scan
,
then
by
pathological
assessment
.

The
clinical
overall
response
(
OR
)
was
80%
,
with
19%
of
complete
responders
(
CR
)
.

The
radiological
OR
was
71%
,
with
16%
of
CR
.

A
pathological
CR
was
demonstrated
in
13%
of
the
patients
according
to
the
Sataloff
classification
.

In
the
multivariate
analysis
,
the
absence
of
HR
expression
and
Ki-67

were
predictive
for
a
clinical

.

A
high
tumour

was
predictive
for
a
pathological

Overexpression
or
amplification
of

or
Topollcalpha
were
not
predictive
of

.
The
study
aimed
to
explore
the
antidepressant-like
effect
of
oleanolic
acid
and
its
possible
mechanism
related
to
the
monoaminergic
system
and
neurotrophin
in
mice
exposed
to
the
repeated
forced
swimming
test
(
FST
)
.

Both
the
duration
and
the
latency
of
immobility
affected
by
oleanolic
acid
(
10
,
20
and
40
mg

kg
)
were
evaluated
in
the
FST
repeated
at
intervals
on
days
1
,
7
and
14
,
followed
by
neurochemical
and
brain-derived
neurotrophic
factor
(
BDNF
)
analyses
in
the
mouse
brain
regions
of
frontal
cortex
and
whole
hippocampus
.

A
repeated
analysis
of
variance
(
ANOVA
)
indicated
that
over
retesting
the
immobility
time
increased
,
whereas
latency
to
immobility
tended
to
decrease
.

Minute-by-minute
analysis
showed
that
immobility
time
also
increased
during
the
4-min
course
of
the
test
.

In
addition
,
post-hoc
Dunnett's
test
demonstrated
that
sub-chronic
and
chronic
,
but
not
acute
,
oleanolic
acid
treatment
reduced
the
immobility
time
(

and
increased
the

Furthermore
,
chronic

of

significantly
increased

)
but
did
not
alter

.

Moreover
,
BDNF
levels
in
the
two
brain
regions
were
also
elevated
by
chronic
oleanolic
acid
treatment
(

.

Taken
together
,
these
findings
imply
that
functions
of
5-HT
,
NE
and
BDNF
may
be
involved
in
the
antidepressant-like
effect
of
oleanolic
acid
.
In
this
study
seven
published
methods
of
extraction
of
skin
free
and
bound
volatile
compounds
have
been
compared
.

The
free
and
bound
volatiles
were
separated
by
solid
phase
extraction
(
SPE
)
and
then
analysed
by
gas
chromatography
coupled
with
mass
spectrometry
(
GC-MS
)
.

The
results
showed
that
the
extraction
of
volatile
compounds
from
grapes
is
highly
affected
by
extraction
solution
features
.

The
solution
at
pH
3
.
2
and
0%
ethanol
resulted
the
most
effective
as
it
led
to
the
extraction
of
a
higher
number
and
amount
of
free
and
glycosilated
volatile
compounds
.

The
selected
extraction
method
of
grape
skin
and
the
process
of
pulp
juice
were
validated
for
quantitative
determination
of
a
wide
range
of
grape
aroma
compounds
.

A
total
of
37
free
and
bound
grape
aroma
compounds
were
quantified
by
GC-MS
in
selective
ion
monitoring
modality
(
SIM
)
.

Among
them
,
26
volatile
compounds
resulted
validated
in
grape
skin
and
pulp
juice
.
Seventeen
derivatives
of
1
,
4-dihydropyridine
(
DHP
)
series
were
tested
in

for
their
ability
to
inhibit
[

,
2
,
4-
(
3
)
H
]
-dexamethasone
binding
to
glucocorticoid
receptor
from
the
rat
liver
cytosol
.

Depending
on
structural
features
and
inhibiting
activities
,
the
compounds
can
be
divided
into
three
groups
.

The
first
group
(
nifedipine
,
foridone
,
J-6-163
,
OSI-4164
and
OSI-7724
)
had
the
highest
activity
:
they
inhibited
specific
ligand-receptor
binding
by
70-80%
at
concentrations
of
10
(
-5
)
M
and
10
(
-4
)
M
,
with
apparent
IC
(
50
)
values
of
1
.
5-6
.
0
muM
.

The
second
group
(
cerebrocrast
,
diethone
,
OSI-1211
and
OSI-7265
)
was
active
at
concentration
of
10
(
-4
)
M
,
and
their
IC
(
50
)
values
were
23-45
muM;
compound
OSI-5003
was
almost
inactive
.

Both
groups
are
compounds
with
scarce
water
solubility
,
more
or
less
lipophilic
.

The
third
group
of
compounds
comprises
ionogenic
compounds
(
organic
cations
or
anions
with
corresponding
inorganic
counterions
)
:
most
of
them
are
water-soluble
(
glutapyrone
,
carbatone
,
gammapyrone
,
OSI-2780
,
OSI-1580
,
OSI-2140
)
or
liposome-forming
(
A-74
)
.

They
lack
the
above-mentioned
activity
.

Among
the
first
two
groups
,
compounds
possessing
more
bulky
substituents
in
positions
3
and
5
are
less
active
.

The
aromatic
ring
in
the
position
4
is
essential
for
the
optimal
activity
.

It
seems
that
there
is
a
bell-shaped
dependence
of
activity
upon
lipophilicity
.

In
general
,
the
compounds
of
the
first
group
are
strong
Ca-antagonists
,
while
the
second
group
includes
moderate
Ca-antagonists
,
but
each
group
comprises
also
compounds
which
lack
Ca
antagonistic
activity
.

All
compounds
of
the
third
group
lack
Ca
antagonistic
properties
.
FSH
and
IGF-I
synergistically
stimulate
gonadal
steroid
production;
conversely
,
silencing
the
FSH
or
the
IGF-I
genes
leads
to
infertility
and
hypogonadism
.

To
determine
the
molecular
link
between
these
hormones
,
we
examined
the
signaling
cross
talk
downstream
of
their
receptors
.

In
human
and
rodent
granulosa
cells
(
GCs
)
,
IGF-I
potentiated
the
stimulatory
effects
of
FSH
and
cAMP
on
the
expression
of
steroidogenic
genes
.

In
contrast
,
inhibition
of
IGF-I
receptor
(
IGF-IR
)
activity
or
expression
using
pharmacological
,
genetic
,
or
biochemical
approaches
prevented
the
FSH-
and
cAMP-induced
expression
of
steroidogenic
genes
and
estradiol
production
.

In
vivo
experiments
demonstrated
that
IGF-IR
inactivation
reduces
the
stimulation
of
steroidogenic
genes
and
follicle
growth
by
gonadotropins
.

FSH
or
IGF-I
alone
stimulated
protein
kinase
B
(
PKB
)
,
which
is
also
known
as
AKT
and
in
combination
synergistically
increased
AKT
phosphorylation
.

Remarkably
,
blocking
IGF-IR
expression
or
activity
decreased
AKT
basal
activity
and
abolished
AKT
activation
by
FSH
.

In
GCs
lacking
IGF-IR
activity
,
FSH
stimulation
of
Cyp19
expression
was
rescued
by
overexpression
of
constitutively
active
AKT
.

Our
findings
demonstrate
,
for
the
first
time
,
that
in
human
,
mouse
,
and
rat
GCs
,
the
well-known
stimulatory
effect
of
FSH
on
Cyp19
and
AKT
depends
on
IGF-I
and
on
the
expression
and
activation
of
the
IGF-IR
.

OBJECTIVE
Recent
evidence
indicates
that
heat-enhanced
food
advanced
glycation
end
products
(
AGEs
)
adversely
affect
vascular
function
.

The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
examine
the
acute
effects
of
an
oral
load
of
heat-treated
,
AGE-modified

)
on

)
.

RESEARCH
DESIGN
AND
METHODS
In
a
double-blind
,
controlled
,
randomized
,
crossover
study
,
19
patients
with
T2DM
received
,
on
two
different
occasions
,
beverages
containing
either
AGE-BLG
or
C-BLG
.

We
measured
macrovascular
[
brachial

of
flow-mediated
dilatation
(
FMD
)
]
and
microvascular
(
laser-Doppler

)
,
and

.

RESULTS
Following
the
AGE-BLG
,
FMD
decreased
at
T90
by
80%
from
baseline
and
remained
decreased
by
42%
at

.

By
comparison
,
following
C-BLG
,
FMD
decreased
by
27%
at
T90
and
51%
at
T180
(

)
.

A
significant
decrease
in

)
,
as
well
as
a
significant
increase
in
N
(

)
-carboxymethyllisine
,
accompanied
intake
of
AGE-BLG
.

There
was
no
change
in
microvascular
function
caused
by
either
beverage
.

CONCLUSIONS
In
patients
with
T2DM
,
acute
oral
administration
of
a
single
AGE-modified
protein
class
significantly
though
transiently
impaired
macrovascular
function
in
concert
with
decreased
nitric
oxide
bioavailability
.

These
AGE-related
changes
were
independent
of
heat
treatment
.
BACKGROUND
:
System
x
(
-
)
(
c
)
is
a
heterodimeric
transporter
,
comprised
of
a
light
chain
,
xCT
,
and
heavy
chain
,
4F2hc
,
which
mediates
the
sodium-independent
exchange
of
cystine
and
glutamate
at
the
plasma
membrane
.

In
the
current
study
we
tested
the
hypothesis
that
stable
transfection
of
Madin-Darby
canine
kidney
(
MDCK
)
cells
with
human
xCT
and
4F2hc
results
in
the
expression
of
functional
system
x
(
-
)
(
c
)
.

METHODS
:
MDCK
cells
were
transfected
stably
with
human
clones
for
xCT
and
4F2hc
.

Analyses
of
time-
and
temperature-dependence
,
saturation
kinetics
,
and
substrate
specificity
of
l-cystine
and
l-glutamate
transport
were
carried
out
in
control
and
xCT-4F2hc-transfected
MDCK
cells
.

We
also
measured
the
uptake
of
l-cystine
in
Xenopus
oocytes
expressing
human
xCT
and
/
or
4F2hc
or
xCT
and
/
or
rBAT
(
a
heavy
chain
homologous
to
4F2hc
)
.

RESULTS
:
All
of
the
different
sets
of
data
revealed
that
transport
of
l-cystine
and
l-glutamate
increased
significantly
(
twofold
to
threefold
)
in
the
MDCK
cells
subsequent
to
transfection
with
xCT-4F2hc
.

Moreover
,
uptake
of
l-cystine
also
increased
(
about
tenfold
)
in
Xenopus
oocytes
expressing
hxCT
and
h4F2hc
.

Biochemical
analyses
of
l-cystine
uptake
in
oocytes
verified
our
findings
in
the
transfected
MDCK
cells
.

Interestingly
,
in
oocytes
injected
with
rBAT
with
or
without
xCT
,
uptake
of
l-cystine
was
significantly
greater
than
that
in
water-injected
oocytes
.

CONCLUSION
:
Our
findings
indicate
that
stable
transfection
of
MDCK
cells
with
xCT
and
4F2hc
results
in
a
cell-line
expressing
a
functional
system
x
(
-
)
(
c
)
transporter
that
can
utilize
l-cystine
and
l-glutamate
as
substrates
.

This
study
apparently
represents
the
first
stable
transfection
of
a
mammalian
cell
line
with
system
x
(
-
)
(
c
)
.
We
investigated
the
inhibitory
activity
of

.

The
tail
derivatizing
the

in
the

,
3
,
4-thiadiazole-2-sulfonamide
scaffold
was
observed
to
be
critical
as
an
inhibitory
determinant
of
these
compounds
.

in

,
4-thiadiazole-2-sulfonamide
,
showed
the
adamantyl
moiety
of
the
inhibitor
residing
in
a
less
utilized
binding
pocket
than
that
of
most
hydrophobic
inhibitors
,
lined
by
the
amino
acid
residues
Ile91
,
Val121
and
Phe131
.

This
binding
site
may
explain
the
diverse
inhibition
profiles
of
5-carboxamide-
and
sufonamide-derivatized
1
,
3
,
4-thiadiazole-2-sulfonamides
and
offers
a
hot
spot
for
designing
isoform
selective
inhibitors
,
considering
that
residues
91
and
131
are
highly
variable
among
the
13
catalytically
active
isoforms

It

is

Lorglumide
is
therefore
a
useful
pharmacological
tool
to
study
the

of

For
its
pharmacological
properties
,
its
relatively
low
toxicity
and
because
it
is
active
also
after
oral

,
lorglumide
is
a
candidate

diagnostic

use
in

PURPOSE
:
Dasatinib
(
BMS-354825
)
,
a
potent
oral
multi-targeted
kinase
inhibitor
against
SRC
and
BCR-ABL
,
has
recently
been
approved
for
the
treatment
of
chronic
myelogenous
leukaemia
(
CML
)
in
imatinib-acquired
resistance
and
intolerance
.

In
vitro
and
in
vivo
studies
were
conducted
to
characterize
the
pharmacokinetics
and
metabolism
of
dasatinib
in
mouse
,
rat
,
dog
,
and
monkey
.

Possible
mechanisms
contributing
to
the
incomplete
oral
bioavailability
of
dasatinib
in
animals
were
investigated
.

METHODS
:
Metabolic
stability
of
dasatinib
was
measured
after
incubation
with
liver
microsomes
(
either
NADPH-
or
UDPGA-fortified
)
and
isolated
hepatocytes
obtained
from
mouse
,
rat
,
dog
,
monkey
,
and
human
.

In
all
cases
,
substrate
depletion
over
time
was
measured
,
and
appropriate
scaling
factors
were
used
to
predict
in
vivo
clearance
.

Pharmacokinetics
of
dasatinib
were
determined
in
mice
,
rats
,
dogs
,
and
monkeys
after
administration
of
single
intravenous
or
oral
doses
.

In
addition
,
the
routes
of
excretion
were
investigated
after
administration
of
dasatinib
to
bile
duct
cannulated
(
BDC
)
rats
.

Absorption
and
first-pass
metabolism
were
evaluated
as
possible
reasons
for
the
incomplete
oral
bioavailability
using
various
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
models
like
Caco-2
cells
,
P-glycoprotein
(
P-gp
)
knockout
mice
,
and
intra-portal
dosing
in
rats
.

RESULTS
:
In
vivo
systemic
plasma
clearance
values
of
dasatinib
were
62
,
26
,
25
,
and
34
ml
/
min
/
kg
in
mouse
,
rat
,
dog
,
and
monkey
,
respectively
.

Scaling
of
in
vitro
hepatocyte
and
liver
microsomal
data
gave
reasonably
good
predictions
of
in
vivo
clearances
across
all
species
.

Percent
distribution
in
blood
cells
ranged
from
43%
in
mouse
to
57%
in
dog
.

Dasatinib
showed
high
volumes
of
distribution
(
>3
l
/
kg
)
and
high
serum
protein
binding
values
(
>90%
)
in
all
four
species
tested
.

Oral
bioavailability
of
dasatinib
ranged
from
14%
in
the
mouse
to
34%
in
the
dog
.

In
rats
,
bioavailability
after
an
intraportal
dose
was
comparable
to
that
after
intra-arterial
administration
.

In
BDC
rats
,
less
than
15%
of
an
intravenous
dose
was
excreted
unchanged
in
urine
,
bile
,
and
the
gastrointestinal
tract
,
suggesting
that
dasatinib
is
cleared
primarily
via
metabolism
.

Dasatinib
has
high
intrinsic
permeability
in
Caco-2
cells
,
however
,
the
efflux
ratio
was
approximately
two-fold
indicating
that
it
may
be
a
substrate
for
an
intestinal
efflux
transporter
.

However
,
in
vivo
studies
in
P-gp
knockout
mice
versus
wild-type
mice
showed
no
difference
in
the
amount
of
dasatinib
remaining
unabsorbed
in
the
gastrointestinal
tract
,
suggesting
that
P-gp
may
not
be
responsible
for
the
incomplete
bioavailability
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
Dasatinib
shows
intermediate
clearance
in
mouse
,
rat
,
dog
,
and
monkey
,
and
distributes
extensively
in
those
species
.

Oxidative
metabolism
appears
to
be
the
predominant
clearance
pathway
.

The
incomplete
oral
bioavailability
may
be
due
to
both
incomplete
absorption
and
high
first-pass
metabolism
.

However
,
the
efflux
transporter
,
P-glycoprotein
does
not
appear
to
be
limiting
oral
absorption
.

)
,

respectively
.

5-HT
also
enhanced

)
38-induced
cAMP
levels
and
CFTR
currents
in
oocytes
expressing
PACAP
receptor
,
CFTR
and

.

The
5-HT-induced
enhancement
of
G
(
s
)
-coupled
receptor-mediated
currents
was
abrogated
by
pretreatment
with
pertussis
toxin
(
PTX
)
and
coexpression
of
G
transducin
alpha
(
G
(

)
.

The
5-HT-induced
enhancement
was
further
augmented
by
coexpression
of
the
Gbetagamma-activated
form
of
adenylate
cyclase
(
AC
)
type
II
but
not
AC
type
III
.

Thus
betagamma-subunits
of
G
(
i
/
o
)
protein
contribute
to
the
enhancement
of
G
(
s
)
-coupled
receptor-mediated
responses
.

5-HT
and
DADLE
did
not
elicit
any
currents
in
oocytes
expressing
5-HT
(
1A
)
R
or
delta-opioid

alone
.

They
elicited

currents
in
oocytes
coexpressing
these
receptors
with
the
Gbetagamma-activated
form
of
phospholipase
C
(

)
-beta2
but
not
with
PLC-beta1
.

These
currents
were
inhibited
by
pretreatment
with
PTX
and
coexpression
of
G
(
t
)
alpha
,
suggesting
that
betagamma-subunits
of
G
(
i

)
protein
activate
PLC-beta2
and
then
cause
intracellular
Ca
(

.

Our
results
indicate
that

of
G
(

participate
in

signals
,

of

The
pathologic
mechanisms
of
Alzheimer's
disease
(
AD
)
have
not
been
fully
uncovered
.

Acrolein
,
a
ubiquitous
dietary
pollutant
and
by-product
of
oxidative
stress
,
can
induce
cytotoxicity
in
neurons
,
which
might
play
an
important
role
in
the
etiology
of
AD
.

Here
,
we
examined
the
effects
of
Acrolein
on
the
AD
pathologies
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
.

We
found
Acrolein
induced
HT22
cells
death
in
concentration-
and
time-dependent
manners
.

Interestingly
,
Acrolein
increased
proteins'
levels
of
amyloid
precursor
protein
(
APP
)
,
β-secretase
(
BACE-1
)
and
the
amyloid
β-peptide
transporter
receptor
for
advanced
glycation
end
products
,
and
decreased
A-disintegrin
and
metalloprotease
(
ADAM
)
10
levels
.

In
vivo
,
chronic
oral
exposure
to
Acrolein
(
2
.
5
mg
/
kg
/
day
by
intragastric
gavage
for
8
weeks
)
induced
mild
cognitive
declination
and
pyknosis
/
atrophy
of
hippocampal
neurons
.

The
activity
of
superoxide
dismutase
was
down-regulated
while
the
level
of
malondialdehyde
was
up-regulated
in
rat
brain
.

Moreover
,
Acrolein
resulted
in
activation
of
astrocytes
,
up-regulation
of
BACE-1
in
cortex
and
down-regulation
of
ADAM-10
in
hippocampus
and
cortex
.

Taken
together
,
our
findings
suggest
that
exposure
to
Acrolein
induces
AD-like
pathology
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
.

Scavenging

might
be

CCAAT
/
enhancer-binding
protein-homologous
protein
(
CHOP
)
has
pivotal
roles
in
regulation
of
growth
and
survival
.

In
the
present
study
,
we
evaluated
the
effects
of
SU5416
on
cell
survival
,
p21
,
and
PI3K
/
Akt
signal
pathway
in
FRO

.

Moreover
,
we
investigated
the
roles
of
CHOP
in
cell
survival
under
condition
of
SU5416
treatment
in
FRO
ATC
cells
.

After
SU5416
treatment
,
cell
viability
,
PARP-1
,
and
caspase-3
protein
levels
were
not
changed
.

p53
and
p27
protein
levels
decreased
while
p21
protein
levels
increased
.

Phospho-Akt
protein
levels
were
not
altered
.

In
SU5416-treated
situation
,
cell
viability
was
not
different
before
and
after
administration
of
either
p21
siRNA
or
LY294002
whereas
it
was
lessened
after
co-administration
of
p21
siRNA
and
LY294002
.

Compared
to
SU5416
treatment
alone
,
cell
viability
was
reduced
with
CHOP
plasmid
but
it
was
unchanged
with
CHOP
siRNA
.

PARP-1
and
caspase-3
protein
levels
with
CHOP
plasmid
were
elevated
whereas
the
protein
levels
with
CHOP
siRNA
were
similar
.

While
CHOP
plasmid
transfection
diminished
p21
and
phospho-Akt
protein
levels
,
CHOP
siRNA
transfection
did
not
alter
the
protein
levels
.

In
conclusion
,
these
results
suggest
that
CHOP
may
sensitize
FRO
ATC
cells
to
SU5416
thereby
inhibiting
cell
survival
by
modulating
p21
and
PI3K
/
Akt
signal
pathway
.

Furthermore
,
these
findings
imply
that
CHOP
may
be
a
possible
candidate
as
the
chemosensitizing
factor
for
induction
of
cytotoxicity
in
ATC
cells
exposed

In
mammals
several
members
of
the
Transient
Receptor
Potential
channel
family
(
TRPs
)
,
expressed
mainly
in
the
sensory
neurons
and
skin
keratinocytes
,
are
implicated
in
relevant
physiological
functions
,
including
thermosensation
,
nociception
and
vision
.

Since
the
TRPV1-4
,
TRPA1
and
TRPM8
channels
from
this
family
play
a
pivotal
role
in
both
the
detection
and
possibly
modulation
of
painful

,
they
are
regarded
as
a
very
promising
target
of
novel
analgesic
drugs
.

A
few
agents
acting
at
TRPs
,
such
as

,
have
a
long
history
of
their
application

are
currently
being

both
in

.

In

we
discuss

as
well
as
the
pharmacological
properties
of
the
TRPs

in

We
present
one
of
the
most
relevant
strategies
in
the
search
for
novel
analgesic
drugs
,
namely
the
TRP
channels
and
their
ligands
,

as
potential
novel
therapeutics
for

and
neuropathic

,
which
indicates

Computational
modeling
suggests
that
the
BSPSA
luminogens
prefer
docking
in
the
hydrophobic
cavity
in
the
EPO
folding
structures
,
and
the
assembly
of
BSPSA
in

makes
the
AIE
available

making
the
monitoring
of

While
none

,
most
of
the
anilides
(
n

)
turned
out
to
moderately

strongly
inhibit
17β-HSD2
.

The
four
most

showed
an
IC₅₀
of
around

and
a
very
good

toward

inhibited

is
also
higher

compared
with
wild-type

and
a
protein
degraded
in
lysosomes
,
were
not
significantly
different
between
+
/
R740S
and
+
/
+
osteoclasts
,
but
the
RCAN1
/
NFATc1
ratio
was
significantly
higher
in
+
/
R740S
versus
+
/
+
cells
.

The
lysosomal
inhibitor
chloroquine
significantly
increased
RCAN1
accumulation
in
+
/
+
cells
,
consistent
with
the
hypothesis
that
higher
lysosomal
pH
impairs
RCAN1
degradation
,
leading
to
a
higher
RCAN1
/
NFATc1
ratio
and
consequently
NFATc1
inhibition
.

Our
data
indicate
that
increased
lysosomal
pH
in
osteoclasts
leads
to
decreased
NFATc1
signaling
and
nuclear
translocation
,
resulting
in
a
cell
autonomous
impairment
of
osteoclastogenesis
in
vitro
.

,
causing
membrane
depolarization
and
stimulating
insulin
secretion
in

cells
.

We
examined
the
ability
of
the
EPAC-selective
cAMP
analog
8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP-AM
to
potentiate
the
action
of
these
drugs
and
the
mechanism
that
might
account
for
it
.

Insulin
secretion
stimulated
by
both
200
μM
tolbutamide
and
20
μM
gliclazide
,
concentrations
that
had
equivalent
effects
on
membrane
potential
,
was
inhibited
by
thapsigargin
(
1
μM
)
or
the
L-type
Ca
(
2
+
)
channel
blocker
nicardipine
(
2
μM
)
and
was
potentiated
by
8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP-AM
at
concentrations
≥2
μM
in
INS-1
cells
.

Ca
(
2
+
)
transients
stimulated
by
either
tolbutamide
or
gliclazide
were
inhibited
by
thapsigargin
or
nicardipine
and
were
significantly
potentiated
by
8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP-AM
at
5
μM
but
not
1
μM
.

Both
tolbutamide
and
gliclazide
stimulated
phospholipase
C
activity;
however
,
only
gliclazide
did
so
independently
of
its
activity
at
K
(
ATP
)
channels
,
and
this
activity
was
partially
inhibited
by
pertussis
toxin
.

8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP-AM
alone
(
5
μM
)
did
not
stimulate
insulin
secretion
,
but
did
increase
intracellular
Ca
(
2
+
)
concentration
significantly
,
and
this
activity
was
inhibited
by
25
μM
2-aminoethoxydiphenylborate
(
2-APB
)
or
the
removal
of
extracellular
Ca
(
2
+
)
.

8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP-AM
potentiation
of
insulin
secretion
stimulated
by
tolbutamide
was
markedly
inhibited
by
2-APB
(
25
μM
)
and
enhanced
by
the
PKC
inhibitor
bisindolylmaleimide
I
(
1
μM
)
.

Our
data
demonstrate
that
the
actions
of
both
tolbutamide
and
gliclazide
are
strongly
potentiated
by
8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP-AM
,
that
gliclazide
can
stimulate
phospholipase
C
activity
via
a
partially
pertussis
toxin-sensitive
mechanism
,
and
that
8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP-AM
potentiation
of
tolbutamide
action
may
involve
activation
of
a
2-APB-sensitive
Ca
(
2

)
influx
.
The
selectins
are
calcium-dependent
C-type
lectins
that
bind
certain
sialylated
,
fucosylated
,
sulfated
glycoprotein
ligands
.

L-selectin
also
recognizes
endothelial
proteoglycans
in
a
calcium-dependent
manner
,
via
heparan
sulfate
(
HS
)
glycosaminoglycan
chains
enriched
in
unsubstituted
glucosamine
units
.

We
now
show
that
these
HS
chains
can
also
bind
P-selectin
,
but
not
E-selectin
.

However
,
while
L-selectin
binding
requires
micromolar
levels
of
free
calcium
,
P-selectin
recognition
is
largely
divalent
cation-independent
.

Despite
this
,
HS
chains
bound
to
P-selectin
are
eluted
by
ethylenediamine
tetraacetic
acid
(
EDTA
)
,
but
only
at
high
concentrations
.

Porcine
intestinal
mucosal
(
mast
cell-derived
)
heparin
(
PIM-heparin
)
shows
similar
properties
,
with
no
binding
to
E-selectin
,
calcium-dependent
binding
of
a
subfraction
to
L-selectin
and
to
P-selectin
,
and
calcium-independent
binding
of
a
larger
fraction
to
P-selectin
,
the
latter
being
disrupted
by
high
EDTA
concentrations
.

Analysis
of
defined
heparin
fragment
pools
shows
a
size
dependence
for
interaction
,
with
tetradecasaccharides
showing
easily
detectable
binding
to
L-
and
P-selectin
affinity
columns
.

L-selectin
binding
fragments
include
more
heavily
sulfated
and
epimerized
regions
and
,
as
with
the
endothelial
HS
chains
,
they
are
enriched
in
free
amino
groups
.

The
P-selectin
binding
component
includes
this
fraction
as
well
as
some
less
highly
modified
regions
.

Thus
,
endothelium-derived
HS
chains
and
mast
cell-derived
heparins
could
play
a
role
in
modulating
the
biology
of
selectins
in
vivo
.

Notably
,
P-
and
L-selectin
binding
to
sialyl-Lewisx
and
to
HL-60
cells
(
which
are
known
to
carry
the
native
ligand
PSGL-1
)
is
inhibited
by
unfractionated
pharmaceutical
heparin
preparations
at
concentrations
12-50-fold
lower
than
those
recommended
for
effective
anticoagulation
in
vivo
.

In
contrast
,
two
low
molecular
weight
heparins
currently
considered
as
clinical
replacements
for
unfractionated
heparin
are
much
poorer
inhibitors
.

Thus
,
patients
undergoing
heparin
therapy
for
other
reasons
may
be
experiencing
clinically
significant
inhibition
of
L-
and
P-selectin
function
,
and
the
current
switchover
to
low-molecular
weight
heparins
may
come
at
some
loss
of
this
effect
.

Low-dose
unfractionated
heparin
should
be
investigated
as
a
treatment
option
for
acute
and
chronic
diseases
in
which
P-
and
L-selectin
play
pathological
roles
.
Mancozeb
(
manganese
/
zinc
ethylene
bis-dithiocarbamate
)
is
an
organometallic
fungicide
that
has
been
associated
with
human
neurotoxicity
and
neurodegeneration
.

In
a
high-throughput
screen
for
modulators
of
KCNQ2
channel
,
a
fundamental
player
modulating
neuronal
excitability
,
Mancozeb
,
was
found
to
significantly
potentiate
KCNQ2
activity
.

Mancozeb
was
validated
electrophysiologically
as
a
KCNQ2
activator
with
an
EC50
value
of
0
.
92±0
.
23μM
.

Further
examination
showed
that
manganese
but
not
zinc
ethylene
bis-dithiocarbamate
is
the
active
component
for
the
positive
modulation
effects
.

In
addition
,
the
compounds
are
effective
when
the
metal
ions
are
substituted
by
iron
but
lack
potentiation
activity
when
the
metal
ions
are
substituted
by
sodium
,
signifying
the
importance
of
the
metal
ion
.

However
,
the
iron
(
Fe
(
3
+
)
)
alone
,
organic
ligands
alone
or
the
mixture
of
iron
with
the
organic
ligand
did
not
show
any
potentiation
effect
,
suggesting
as
the
active
ingredient
is
a
specific
complex
rather
than
two
separate
additive
or
synergistic
components
.

Our
study
suggests
that
potentiation
on
KCNQ2
potassium
channels
might
be
the
possible
mechanism
of
Mancozeb
toxicity
in
the
nervous
system
.
A
large
amount
of
the
data
gathered
in
the
last
50
years
support
the
hypothesis
that
alterations
of
the
serotonin
(
5-HT
)
neurotransmission
play
a
crucial
role
in
the
pathophysiology
of
not
only
major
depression
(
MD
)
,
but
also
of
different
neuropsychiatric
disorders
.

Research
in
this
field
has
been
substantially
promoted
by
the
evidence
that
the
reuptake
protein
(
SERT
)
,
present
in
presynaptic
neurons
,
is
a
key
element
in
terminating
the
activity
of
the
neurotransmitter
in
the
synaptic
cleft
.

For
this
reason
,
it
was
specifically
targeted
for
the
development
of
second-generation
antidepressants
,
in
particular
of
selective
5-HT
reuptake
inhibitors
(
SSRIs
)
,
with
the
aim
of
increasing
the
intrasynaptic
5-HT
concentrations
.

Moreover
,
since
a
lot
of
studies
showed
that
circulating
platelets
and
,
more
recently
,
lymphocytes
possess
functional
SERT
proteins
,
they
have
been
widely
used
as
peripheral
mirrors
of
the
same
structures
located
in
the
central
nervous
system
.

The
presence
of
functional
SERT
in
blood
cells
suggests
strict
relationships
between
the
nervous
and
the
immune
system
that
need
to
be
better
clarified
in
MD
,
as
well
as
the
possibility
of
reciprocal
modulation
of
the
two
systems
by
different
drugs
.

This
paper
aims
to
review
briefly
the
literature
on
the
5-HT
hypothesis
of
depression
with
a
major
focus
on
the
possible
role
of
SERT
in
this
disorder
,
while
highlighting
how
recent
data
are
more
oriented
on
dimensional
rather
than
nosological
involvement
of
this
structure
in
different
conditions
spanning
from
normality
to
pathology
.
Chloracne
is
commonly
observed
in
humans
exposed
to
2
,
3
,
7
,
8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin
(
TCDD
)
;
yet
,
the
mechanism
of
toxicity
is
not
well
understood
.

Using
normal
human
epidermal
keratinocytes
,
we
investigated
the
mechanism
of
TCDD-mediated
enhancement
of
epidermal
differentiation
by
integrating
functional
genomic
,
metabolomic
,
and
biochemical
analyses
.

TCDD
increased
the
expression
of
40%
of
the
genes
of
the
epidermal
differentiation
complex
found
on
chromosome
1q21
and
75%
of
the
genes
required
for
de
novo
ceramide
biosynthesis
.

Lipid
analysis
demonstrated
that
eight
of
the
nine
classes
of
ceramides
were
increased
by
TCDD
,
altering
the
ratio
of
ceramides
to
free
fatty
acids
.

TCDD
decreased
the
expression
of
the
glucose
transporter
,
SLC2A1
,
and
most
of
the
glycolytic
transcripts
,
followed
by
decreases
in
glycolytic
intermediates
,
including
pyruvate
.

NADH
and
Krebs
cycle
intermediates
were
decreased
,
whereas
NAD
(
+
)
was
increased
.

Mitochondrial
glutathione
(
GSH
)
reductase
activity
and
the
GSH
/
glutathione
disulfide
ratio
were
decreased
by
TCDD
,
ultimately
leading
to
mitochondrial
dysfunction
,
characterized
by
decreased
inner
mitochondrial
membrane
potential
and
ATP
production
,
and
increased
production
of
the
reactive
oxygen
species
(
ROS
)
,
hydrogen
peroxide
.

Aryl
hydrocarbon
receptor
(
AHR
)
antagonists
blocked
the
response
of
many
transcripts
to
TCDD
,
and
the
endpoints
of
decreased
ATP
production
and
differentiation
,
suggesting
regulation
by
the
AHR
.

Cotreatment
of
cells
with
chemical
antioxidants
or
the
enzyme
catalase
blocked
the
TCDD-mediated
acceleration
of
keratinocyte
cornified
envelope
formation
,
an
endpoint
of
terminal
differentiation
.

Thus
,
TCDD-mediated
ROS
production
is
a
critical
step
in
the
mechanism
of
this
chemical
to
accelerate
keratinocyte
differentiation
.
Topoisomerase
II
(
TOP2
)
poisons
interfere
with
the
breakage
/
reunion
reaction
of
TOP2
resulting
in
DNA
cleavage
.

In
the
current
studies
,
we
show
that
two
different
classes
(
ATP-sensitive
and
-insensitive
)
of
TOP2
poisons
can
be
identified
based
on
their
differential
sensitivity
to
the
ATP-bound
conformation
of
TOP2
.

First
,
in
the
presence
of
1
mm
ATP
or
the
nonhydrolyzable
analog
adenosine
5'-
(
beta
,
gamma-imino
)
triphosphate
,
TOP2-mediated
DNA
cleavage
induced
by
ATP-sensitive
TOP2
poisons
(
e
.

g
.

doxorubicin
,
etoposide
,
mitoxantrone
,
and
4'-
(
9-acridinylamino
)
methanesulfon-m-anisidide
)
was
30-100-fold
stimulated
,
whereas
DNA
cleavage
induced
by
ATP-insensitive
TOP2
poisons
(
e
.

g
.

amonafide
,
batracylin
,
and
menadione
)
was
only
slightly
(
less
than
3-fold
)
affected
.

In
addition
,
ADP
was
shown
to
strongly
antagonize
TOP2-mediated
DNA
cleavage
induced
by
ATP-sensitive
but
not
ATP-insensitive
TOP2
poisons
.

Second
,
C427A
mutant
human
TOP2alpha
,
which
exhibits
reduced
ATPase
activity
,
was
shown
to
exhibit
cross-resistance
to
all
ATP-sensitive
but
not
ATP-insensitive
TOP2
poisons
.

Third
,
using
ciprofloxacin
competition
assay
,
TOP2-mediated
DNA
cleavage
induced
by
ATP-sensitive
but
not
ATP-insensitive
poisons
was
shown
to
be
antagonized
by
ciprofloxacin
.

These
results
suggest
that
ATP-bound
TOP2
may
be
the
specific
target
of
ATP-sensitive
TOP2
poisons
.

Using
Lac
repressor-operator
complexes
as
roadblocks
,
we
show
that
ATP-bound
TOP2
acts
as
a
circular
clamp
capable
of
entering
DNA
ends
and
sliding
on
unobstructed
duplex
DNA
.
Inhaled
glucocorticoids
are
widely
used
to
treat
chronic
obstructive
pulmonary
disease
without
much
evidence
of
efficiency
in
this
disease
where
neutrophils
may
contribute
to
the
pathophysiology
.

This
prompted
us
to
test
the
effects
of
several
currently
used
inhaled
and
systemic
glucocorticoids
on
human
neutrophil
apoptosis
.

Beclomethasone
,
budesonide
,
dexamethasone
,
fluticasone
propionate
,
hydrocortisone
and
prednisolone
inhibited
apoptosis
in
a
concentration-dependent
manner
as
assessed
by
flow
cytometric
analysis
,
annexin-V
binding
and
morphological
analysis
.

The
maximal
inhibition
of
apoptosis
was
50-60%
.

The
order
of
potency
was
fluticasone
propionate
(
EC
(
50
)
0
.
6
+
/
-0
.
2
nM
)
approximately
equal
to
budesonide
(
EC
(
50
)
0
.
8
+
/
-0
.
2
nM
)
>
dexamethasone
approximately
equal
to
prednisolone
approximately
equal
to
beclomethasone
approximately
equal
to
hydrocortisone
.

The
inhibitory
effects
of
glucocorticoids
were
reversed
by
mifepristone
.

Moreover
,
glucocorticoids
slightly
enhanced
the
inhibitory
effect
of
granulocyte-macrophage
colony-stimulating
factor
(
GM-CSF
)
on
neutrophil
apoptosis
.

The
present
data
suggests
that
budesonide
and
fluticasone
propionate
prolong
human
neutrophil
survival
by
inhibiting
apoptosis
at
clinically
relevant
drug
concentrations
via
an
effect
on
glucocorticoid
receptor
.
Diabetic
patients
often
have
manifestation
of
coronary
heart
disease
.

As
a
consequence
,
therapeutic
strategies
for
diabetes
should
pay
more
attention
to
hypoglycemic
agents
which
do
not
have
adverse
effects
on
myocardium
.

Mitiglinide
is
considered
to
have
little
or
no
impact
on
the
cardioprotective
effect
of
ischemic
preconditioning
(
IP
)
because
of
its
high
selectivity
for
blocking
sulfonylurea
receptor1
(
SUR1
)
.

However
,
glibenclamide
,
a
nonselective
SUR
blocker
,
attenuates
this
beneficial
effect
.

In
the
present
study
,
we
tested
the
hypothesis
that
mitiglinide
preserves
the
protective
action
of
IP
evaluated
by
ischemia
/
reperfusion
ventricular
tachyarrhythmia
(
rVT
)
in
isolated
perfused
rat
hearts
.

After
initial
perfusion
,
the
hearts
were
assigned
to
one
of
the
following
groups
:
1
)
non-IP
with
control
perfusion
buffer
(
non-IP
group
)
;
2
)
IP
with
control
perfusion
buffer
(
IP-C
group
)
;
3
)
IP
with
perfusion
buffer
containing
glibenclamide
(
IP-G
group
)
;
and
4
)
IP
with
perfusion
buffer
containing
mitiglinide
(
IP-M
group
)
.

The
protocol
for
the
non-IP
group
consisted
of
21
minutes
of
aerobic
perfusion
before
10
minutes
of
ischemia
.

In
the
other
3
groups
(
IP
groups
)
,
there
were
3
cycles
of
2-minute
ischemia
followed
by
5
minutes
of
reperfusion
before
10
minutes
of
ischemia
.

The
IP-C
group
had
a
significantly
shorter
rVT
duration
than
the
non-IP
group
(
4
.
4
+
/
-
1
.
8
minutes
versus
14
.
3
+
/
-
2
.
5
minutes;
P
<
0
.
05
)
.

rVT
duration
was
the
shortest
in
the
IP-M
group
(
3
.
9
+
/
-
1
.
0
minutes
)
,
but
among
the
longest
in
the
IP-G
group
(
14
.
0
+
/
-
2
.
6
minutes
)
.

In
conclusion
,
mitiglinide
preserved
the
cardioprotective
effect
of
IP
,
however
,
glibenclamide
abolished
this
beneficial
effect
.

Therefore
,
mitiglinide
may
offer
a
long-term
benefit
for
myocardial
ischemia
in
diabetic
patients
.

to
that
of
the
ferric
heme
of
N
(
omega
)
-nitro-L-arginine-bound
nNOS
,
suggesting
that
the
photo-dissociated
NO
might
move
away
from
the
heme
.

Low
photo-dissociability
of
NO
in
this
complex
indicated
less
restricted
movement
of
the
dissociated
NO
in
the
distal
region
of
the
heme
,
which
might
result
in
the
rapid
rebinding
of
the
NO
to
the
ferric
heme
at
5
K
.

In
the
presence
of
substrate
L-arginine
,
derivatives
,
or
product
L-citrulline
,
the
photo-products
from
the
ferric
NO
complexes
exhibited
large
novel
EPR
signals
with
a
spin-coupled
interaction
between
the
ferric
heme
(
S
=
5
/
2
)
and
the
photolyzed
NO
(
S
=
1
/
2
)
,
suggesting
a
stereochemically
restricted
interaction
between
the
photo-dissociated
NO
and
the
guanidino-
or
the
ureido-group
of
the
substrate
analogues
at
the
distal
heme
region
of
nNOS
.

The
photo-product
from
the
NO
complex
produced
from
citrulline-bound
nNOS
might
be
the
same
intermediate
species
as
that
formed
in
the
last
step
of
the
catalytic
cycle
.

and
in

.

The
effects
of
SFO
in

especially
the
cardiovascular
system
,
are
little
known
.

Disruption
of
vulnerable
atherosclerotic
plaques
in
atherosclerosis
,
a
chronic
inflammatory
disease
,
is
the
main
cause
of
cardiovascular
events
.

In
this
study
,
we
investigated
SFO-induced
atherosclerotic
plaque
vulnerability
(
possibility
of
rupture
)
in
apolipoprotein
E-knockout
(
apoE

in
high

SFO
(
SFO-HD
)
treated
group
,
which
is
only
31
.
2%
in
control
group
.

SFO
treatment
changed
the
lesion
composition
to
an
unstable
phenotype
,
increased
the
number
of
apoptotic
cells
in
plaque
and
the
endothelium
in
plaques
was
damaged
after
SFO
treatment
.

Furthermore
,
compared
with
control
groups
,
the
plaque
endothelium
level
of
p75
(
NTR
)
was
3-fold
increased
and
the
liver
level
of
p75
(
NTR
)
was
17
.
4-fold
increased
by
SFO-HD
.

Meanwhile
,
the
serum
level
of
KC
(
a

the
main

in
apoE
(

mice
was
up
to
357pg

Thus
,
SFO
contributes
to
the
instability
of

through
activating

Nisoldipine
(
a
DHP

)
blocks
the
smooth
muscle
channel
more
potently
than
the
cardiac
one
,
a
phenomenon
observed
not
only
in
native
channels
but
also
in
expressed
channels
.

We
examined
whether
this
tissue
specificity
was
attributable
to
differences
of
inactivation
in
the
two
channel
types
.

We
expressed
cardiac
or
smooth
muscle
alpha1C
subunits
in
combination
with
beta2a
and
alpha2
/
delta
subunits
in
human
embryonic
kidney
cells
,
and
used
2
mM
Ca2
+
as
the
permeant
ion
.

This
system
thus
reproduces
the
in
vivo
topology
and
charge
carrier
of
the
channels
while
facilitating
comparison
of
the
two
alpha1C
splice
variants
.

Both
voltage-dependent
and
isoform-specific
sensitivity
of
10
nM
nisoldipine
inhibition
of
the
channel
were
demonstrated
,
with
the
use
of
-100
mV
as
the
holding
potential
for
fully
reprimed
channels
and
-65
mV
to
populate
the
inactivated
state
.

Under
drug-free
conditions
,
we
characterized
fast
inactivation
(
1-sec
prepulses
)
and
slow
inactivation
(
3
min
prepulses
)
in
the
two
isoforms
.

Inactivation
parameters
were
not
statistically
different
in
the
two
channel
isoforms;
if
anything
,
cardiac
channels
tended
to
inactivate
more
than
the
smooth
muscle
channels
at
relevant
voltages
.

Likewise
,
the
voltage-dependent
activation
was
identical
in
the
two
isoforms
.

We
thus
conclude
that
the
more
potent
nisoldipine
inhibition
of
smooth
muscle
versus
cardiac
L-type
Ca2
+
channels
is
not
attributable
to
differences
in
channel
inactivation
or
activation
.

must
be

BACKGROUND
&
AIMS
:
It
is
unclear
whether
weight
loss
with
the
noradrenergic
(
norepinephrine
)
and
serotonergic
(
5-hydroxytryptamine
)
reuptake
inhibitor
,
sibutramine
,
is
associated
with
altered
stomach
functions
and
whether
genetics
influence
treatment
response
.

METHODS
:
Forty-eight
overweight
and
obese
but
otherwise
healthy
participants
were
randomized
to
placebo
or
sibutramine
(
15
mg
/
day
for
12
weeks
)
.

At
baseline
and
posttreatment
we
measured
the
following
:
gastric

for
solids
and
liquids
by
scintigraphy
,
gastric
volumes
by
single-photon
emission
computed
tomography
,
maximum

and
30-minute

symptoms
,
and
selected
gastrointestinal
hormones
.

All
participants
received
structured
behavior

for
weight
management
.

The
influence
of
candidate
gene
polymorphisms
involved
in

on
weight

and
gastric

was
evaluated
.

RESULTS
:
The
overall
average
weight

posttreatment
was
5

.

The
sibutramine

showed
significant
retardation
in
gastric

of
solids
(
P
=

)
,
reduced
maximum

(
P

)
,
and
increased
postprandial

YY
compared
with
the
placebo
group
.

Obese
females
showed
greater
effects
of
sibutramine
on
weight
loss
and
gastric
emptying
of
solids
and
liquids
.

Gastric
volumes
and
postchallenge
symptoms
were
not
significantly
different
in
the
2
treatment
groups
.

The
LS
/
SS
genotype
of
the
promoter
for
SLC6A4
was
associated
with
enhanced
weight
loss
with
sibutramine
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
Weight
reduction
with
sibutramine
is
associated
with
altered
gastric
functions
and
increased
peptide
YY
and
is
significantly
associated
with
SLC6A4

.

The
role
of
genetic
variation
in
SLC6A4
on
weight

in
response
to

ABSTRACT
TRUNCATED
AT
250
WORDS
)
Preterm
labour
is
a
major
cause
of
perinatal
mortality
and
morbidity
.

However
,
during
the
past
40
years
of
clinical
studies
and
despite
the
use
of
multiple
therapeutic
agents
,
the
rate
of
preterm
birth
has
not
drastically
declined
.

In
1991
,
it
was
estimated
that
in
the
US
approximately
116
,
000
women
admitted
with
acute
episodes
of
preterm
labour
were
treated
each
year
with
ritodrine
,
which
is
the
first
drug
approved
by
the
US
FDA
and
still
remains
the
standard
therapy
for
treating
preterm
labour
.

Ritodrine
(
Yutopar
(
trade
mark
)
)
stimulates
the
beta
(
2
)
-adrenergic
receptor
throughout
the
body
,
causing
an
inhibitory
action
in
different
tissues
that
,
among
other
side
effects
,
also
leads
to
an
attenuation
of
uterine
contractility
.

More
recently
,
a
new
therapeutic
agent
,
atosiban
(
Tractocile
(
trade
mark
)
)
,
a
peptidic
oxytocin
receptor
antagonist
,
has
been
introduced
to
the
market
.

However
,
the
use
of
the
various
pharmacological
agents
to
treat
preterm
labour
remains
restricted
,
due
to
lack
of
uterine
selectivity
,
low
efficacy
and
potentially
serious
side
effects
for
the
mother
or
the
foetus
.

Therefore
,
there
is
an
urgent
need
to
develop
drugs
with
myometrial
selectivity
that
would
allow
long-lasting
inhibition
of
labour
and
prolong
pregnancy
up
to
a
stage
when
good
foetal
maturation
raises
the
chances
of
survival
.

One
of
the
major
obstacles
hampering
the
development
of
new
therapeutic
agents
is
the
marked
inter-species
difference
in
terms
of
preterm
labour
physiology
,
which
complicates
the
preclinical
evaluation
of
new
candidate
molecules
in
animal
models
of
disease
.

In
this
review
,
the
authors
will
provide
a
comprehensive
update
of
past
,
current
and
new
approaches
for
the
management
of
preterm
labour
,
including
beta
(
2
)
-adrenergic
agonists
,
calcium
channel
blockers
,
oxytocin
antagonists
,
prostaglandin
antagonists
and
other
potential
therapeutics
.

For
each
of
the
therapies
used
today
,
the
review
will
cover
the
mechanism
of
action
,
benefit
and
adverse
effects
,
and
discuss
the
promise
and
potential
benefits
of
new
emerging
therapeutic
agents
.

Functionalized
alkynyl
polyvinyl

(
PVA
MMs
)
were
developed
for
the
specific
enrichment
of
sialic
acid-rich
glycoproteins
by
click
chemistry
.

The
capture
capability
for
proteins
was
evaluated
through
a
novel
dual-labeled
bovine
serum
albumin
(
BSA
)
that
utilizes
fluorescence
resonance
energy
transfer
(
FRET
)
.

The
PVA
MM
parameters
,
including
the
size
and
coverage
of
functionalized
groups
,
were
optimized
by
response
surface
methodology
.

The
optimal
parameters
obtained
were
1
.
25-6
.
31
μm
in
size
and
48
.
53-73
.
05%
in
coverage
.

Then
,
the
optimal
PVA
MMs
were
synthesized
,
and
the
morphology
and
surface
chemical
properties
were
characterized
by
transmission
electron
microscopy
(
TEM
)
,
scanning
electron
microscopy
(
SEM
)
,
and
Fourier
transform
infrared
spectroscopy
(
FT-IR
)
.

To
capture
glycoproteins
from
the
cell
surface
,
a
bioorthogonal
chemical
method
was
applied
to
metabolically
label
them
with
an
azide
group
.

The
functionalized
alkynyl
PVA
MMs
showed
a
high
specificity
and
strong
binding
capability
for
glycoproteins
through
a
[
3
+
2
]
cycloaddition
reaction
.

The
results
indicated
that
the
functionalized
alkynyl
PVA
MMs
could
be
applied
to
the
enrichment
of
cell
glycoproteins
,
and
the
merits
of
the
MMs
suggested
an
attractive
and
potential
way
to
facilitate
glycoprotein
research
.
Trastuzumab
is
a
monoclonal
antibody
that
targets
the
extracellular
domain
of
HER2
,
a
member
of
the
epidermal
growth
factor
receptor
(
EGFR
)
family
.

Trastuzumab
is
currently
approved
for
the
treatment
of
breast
cancer
overexpressing
HER2
,
given
alone
or
in
combination
with
paclitaxel
or
docetaxel
.

Trastuzumab
pharmacokinetics
are
characterized
by
a
low
systemic
clearance
,
a
low
volume
of
distribution
(
4l
)
and
a
very
long
half-life
(
28
days
)
comparable
to
that
of
endogenous
immunoglobulins
G
.

The
elimination
pathways
are
not
yet
defined
and
the
clinical
relevance
of
trastuzumab
kinetic
variability
is
unknown
.

Whether
exposure
might
correlate
with
toxic
effects
or
inadequate
response
has
not
been
explored
.

No
drug-drug
interactions
have
been
reported
.

This
is
not
surprising
because
based
on
the
current
knowledge
,
no
monoclonal
antibody
(
including
trastuzumab
)
has
been
found
to
interact
with
major
molecular
pharmacokinetic
determinants
such
enzymes
,
drug
transporters
or
orphan
nuclear
receptors
.

Dosage
regimens
of
trastuzumab
are
similar
either
it
is
used
in
the
adjuvant
setting
(
postoperative
)
or
in
metastatic
disease
.

According
to
the
official
labelling
,
trastuzumab
is
given
by
intravenous
perfusion
at
a
dose
based
on
body
weight
,
weekly
(
metastatic
,
adjuvant
)
or
3-weekly
(
adjuvant
)
.

The
schedule
also
includes
a
loading
dose
at
the
initiation
of
the
treatment
.

The
recommended
duration
of
treatment
is
currently
one
year
(
adjuvant
)
or
until
the
progression
of
the
disease
(
metastatic
)
.

Regarding
the
adjuvant
setting
,
different
dosage
regimens
have
been
tested
(
from
9
weeks
to
2
years
)
but
the
optimal
duration
of
treatment
is
unknown
.

The
short
course
of
trastuzumab
(
9
weeks
)
appears
promising
in
terms
of
activity
,
tolerance
and
cost
but
should
be
compared
to
1
or
2-years
treatments
.

In
addition
,
dosing
regimens
might
be
optimized
by
integrating
pharmacokinetic
elements
.

In
the
adjuvant
setting
,
given
the
more
favorable
kinetic
situation
(
absence
of
tumor
penetration
)
,
a
less
intense
dosage
regimen
might
be
appropriate
when
compared
with
that
used
in
metastatic
disease
.

Further
body
weight
is
weakly
related
to
trastuzumab
exposure
and
it
is
not
proven
that
it
significantly
affects
clinical
activity
.

These
pharmacokinetic
considerations
may
support
the
use
of
fixed
doses
given
monthly
,
on
short
periods
,
for
the
treatment
of
early
breast
cancer
.

sol-gel
phase
transition
.

Mouse
fibroblast
L929
cells
were
encapsulated
and
cultured
within
the
hydrogel
matrices
,
and
the
encapsulated
cells
were
shown
to
be
highly
viable
in
the
gel
matrices
,
suggesting
that
the
hydrogels
have
excellent
cytocompatibilities
.

The
mass
loss
of
the
hydrogels
in
vitro
was
accelerated
by
the
presence
of
proteinase
K
compared
to
the
control
group
.

In
vivo
biocompatibility
studies
revealed
that
the
in
situ
formed
gels
in
the
subcutaneous
layer
last
for
∼21
days
,
and
H&E
staining
study
suggested
acceptable
biocompatibility
of
our
materials
in
vivo
.

The
presence
of
alkynyl
side
groups
in
the
PEG-PPLG
copolymers
allowed
convenient
further
functionalization
with
azide-modified
bioactive
molecules
,
such
as
biotin
and
galactose
.

The
biofunctionalized
PEG-polypeptide
block
copolymers
showed
sol-gel
phase
transitions
similar
to
the
parent
copolymers
.

Interestingly
,
the
incorporation
of
galactose
groups
into
the
hydrogels
was
found
to
improve
cell
adhesion
,
likely
due
to
the
adsorption
of
fibronectin
(
FN
)
in
cell-extracellular
matrix
(
ECM
)
.

Because
bioactive
materials
have
shown
unique
advantages
in
biomedical
applications
,
especially
tissue
engineering
and
regenerative
medicine
applications
,
we
believe
our
novel
functionalizable
thermosensitive
hydrogels
have
potential
to
serve
as
a
versatile
platform
for
the
development
of
new
biofunctional
materials
,
for
example
,
bioadhesive
and
bioresponsive
hydrogels

Proliferation
and
growth
of
gastroduodenal
mucosal
cells
represent
important
elements
of
mucosal
defense
and
any
alterations
in
the
balance
between
cell
proliferation
and
cell
loss
may
lead
to
trophic
changes
in
mucosa
.

Acute
mucosal
lesions
induced
by
local
irritants
such
as
bile
salts
,
ethanol
,
aspirin
,
or
stress
are
accompanied
by
widespread
damage
of
surface
epithelium
followed
by
almost
immediate
repair
due
to
mucosal
cell
restitution
,
which
is
unrelated
to
cell
proliferation
but
does
depend
on
the
intrinsic
property
of
mucosal
cells
to
cover
superficial
defects
.

Cytoprotection
involves
the
protection
of
the
regeneration
zone
and
the
maintenance
of
blood
flow
to
the
mucosa
.

Various
factors
that
exhibit
mucosal
growth-promoting
action
include
EGF
,
gastrin
,
growth
hormone
,
and
GH-releasing
factor
.

These
factors
protect
the
mucosa
against
acute
injury
but
the
mechanism
of
this
effect
is
not
clear
.

These
trophic
agents
,
especially
EGF
,
accelerate
the
healing
of
chronic
gastroduodenal
ulceration
and
may
contribute
to
the
healing
effects
of
sucralfate
or
De-Nol
.

These
effects
of
trophic
substances
are
related
to
their
stimulation
of
cell
proliferation
and
DNA
,
RNA
,
and
protein
synthesis
and
can
be
reversed
by
the
suppression
of
mucosal
growth
.

Prostaglandins
,
especially
their
stable
methylated
analogs
,
display
trophic
effects
on
the
gastric
mucosa
but
neither
gastroprotective
nor
ulcer
healing
actions
of
PG
can
be
attributed
to
their
trophic
effect
.

With
increasing
attention
being
paid
to
mucosal
growth
and
repair
as
components
of
mucosal
defense
,
the
emphasis
of
drug
therapy
of
acute
or
chronic
gastroduodenal
lesions
is
likely
to
move
toward
strengthening
mucosal
defense
rather
than
the
inhibition
of
aggressive
factors
.
3-Methylcrotonylglycinuria
is
an
inborn
error
of
leucine
catabolism
with
an
autosomal
recessive
pattern
of
inheritance
that
results
from
a
deficiency
of
3-methylcrotonyl-CoA
carboxylase
(
MCC
)
.

We
report
on
a
nine-year-old
boy
with
severe
psychomotor
retardation
who
developed
infantile
spasms
at
the
age
of
three
weeks
.

Urine
analysis
at
the
age
of
two
years
revealed
massive
3-methylcrotonylglycinuria
and
3-hydroxyisovaleric
aciduria
suggesting
MCC
deficiency
.

Carnitine

were
decreased
.

Biotin

led
to
a
dramatic
decrease
in
the
frequency
of

,
disappearance
of

,
and
near

of
organic

.

Four
months
later
a
protein-restricted
diet
was
introduced
in
addition
and
the
boy
remained
clinically
and
metabolically
stable
.

However
,
severe
psychomotor
delay
persisted
,
and
the
seizures
partially
reoccurred
.

Biochemical
findings
showed
partial
MCC
deficiency
in

.

Molecular

revealed
a

mutation
,
MCCA-R385S
,
converting
arginine
to
serine
in
a
highly
conserved
region
of
the
MCCA
gene
.

This
is
the
first

with
MCC
deficiency
caused
by
a
heterozygote
mutation
and
who
demonstrated
a
substantial
and
sustained
clinical
and
biochemical
response
to
therapeutic
doses
of
biotin
.

Sadly
,
this
patient
again
also
demonstrates
that
the
main
determinant
of
the
outcome
of
even
easily
treatable

is
timely

CaMKIIα
is
expressed
at

density
in
the

where
it
binds
to

inhibiting
their

.

In

,
activation

potentiates
D1

In

we
examined
whether
the

in
the
substantia

(

are
modulated
by

also
reversed
the

Immunoblot
studies
showed
that
K
(

)
-depolarization
increased
CaMKIIα
phosphorylation
in
a

sensitive
manner
and
promoted
CaMKIIα

to

.

In

potentiated

only
when

In
the
presence
of
this

reduced
the

also

KN-62
did

These

show
that
in

CaMKIIα
inhibits

of

in
a
Ca
(

These

The
phytochemical
resveratrol
(
trans-3
,
4'
,
5-trihydroxystilbene
)
is
a
naturally
occurring
polyphenol
with
a
plethora
of
health-beneficial
properties
,
including
a
preventive
role
in
cancer
.

We
surmise
that
resveratrol
may
exert
its
diverse
biological
effects
by
interacting
with
specific
target
proteins
,
denoted
RTPs
.

To
test
this
possibility
,
resveratrol
was
immobilized
on
epoxy-activated
agarose
forming
a
resveratrol
affinity
column
(
RAC
)
,
which
was
used
to
detect
and
isolate
RTPs
.

Distinct
RTPs
can
be
resolved
on
RAC
by
fractionation
with
increasing
NaCl
,
followed
by
1mM
ATP
,
and
finally
,
with
1-2mM
resveratrol
.

A
22-kDa
polypeptide
,
RTP-22
,
eluted
with
resveratrol
was
identified
by
MALDI-TOF
MS
and
cloning
/
expression
in
Escherichia
coli
,
as
dihydronicotinamide
riboside
quinone
reductase
2
(
NQO2
)
.

The
utility
of
RAC
was
additionally
explored
with
extracts
derived
from
different
staging
prostate
cancer
cells
.

NQO2
was
most
abundant
in
CWR22Rv1
,
a
model
for
prostate
cancer
transition
from
androgen-dependent
to
the
hormone-refractory
state
,
but
was
marginally
expressed
in
JCA-1
cells
as
representing
more
advanced
stage
prostate
cancer
.

These
results
provide
evidence
for
the
existence
of
distinctive
RTPs
in
mammalian
cells
and
that
RAC
is
a
facile
approach
to
identify
and
purify
RTPs
.
Hypoxic-ischemic
brain
injury
in
the
perinatal
period
is
a
major
cause
of
morbidity
and
mortality
.

Presently
,
there
are
no
proven
effective
therapies
with
which
to
safeguard
the
human
neonatal
brain
against
this
type
of
injury
.

Minocycline
,
a
semisynthetic
tetracycline
,
has
been
shown
to
be
neuroprotective
in
certain
adult
ischemic
injury
/
stroke
and
neurodegenerative
disease
models
.

However
,
minocycline's
neuroprotective
effects
have
not
been
assessed
after
insults
to
the
neonatal
brain
.

We
now
report
that
minocycline
administered
either
immediately
before
or
immediately
after
a
hypoxic-ischemic
insult
substantially
blocks
tissue
damage
in
a
rodent
model
of
neonatal
hypoxic-ischemic
brain
injury
.

Minocycline
treatment
prevents
the
formation
of
activated
caspase-3
,
a
known
effector
of
apoptosis
,
as
well
as
the
appearance
of
a
calpain
cleaved
substrate
,
a
marker
of
excitotoxic
/
necrotic
cell
death
.

To
our
knowledge
,
this
is
the
first
report
of
a
systemic
treatment
that
can
be
administered
after
a
hypoxic-ischemic
insult
,
which
provides
robust
,
nearly
complete
neuroprotection
to
the
developing
brain
.

Our
data
suggest
that
minocycline
or
a
related
neuroprotective
tetracycline
may
be
a
candidate
to
consider
in
human
clinical
trials
to
protect
the
developing
brain
against
hypoxic-ischemic-induced
damage
.
Bisphenol
A
(
BPA
)
and
diethylstilbestrol
(
DES
)
are
endocrine-disrupting
chemicals
that
interact
with
the
human
pregnane
X
receptor
(
PXR
)
.

CYP3A4
enzyme
is
essential
in
the
hydroxylation
of
steroid
hormones
and
is
regulated
by
PXR
.

In
the
present
study
,
human
and
rat
hepatoma
cell
lines
were
exposed
to
BPA
and
DES
.

Both
BPA
and
DES
(
10-50μM
)
caused
a
significant
activation
of
the
CYP3A4
promoter
via
the
PXR
in
the
DPX2
human
hepatoma
cell
line
.

No
activation
of
rat
PXR
was
seen
.

BPA
and
DES
treated
DPX2
cells
demonstrated
increased
expression
of
CYP3A4
mRNA
,
and
increased
enzyme
activity
.

In
summary
,
BPA
,
in
concentrations
relevant
to
current
safety
levels
of
human
exposure
,
activates
the
human
PXR
and
demonstrates
an
increase
in
CYP3A4
mRNA
expression
and
enzyme
activity
.

BPA
actions
in
this
model
system
occur
to
a
greater
extent
than
DES
.

This
study
raises
concerns
regarding
our
current
toxicity
testing
paradigms
and
species
utilization
.
The
recent
increase
in
the
clinical
use
of
synthetic
vitamin
A
compounds
has
led
to
concern
of
possible
side
effects
.

Some
of
these
effects
are
known
to
be
influenced
by
dietary
levels
of
vitamin
K
.

We
therefore
compared
the
toxic
effects
of
13-cis-retinoic
acid
(
13cisRA
)
,
retinyl
acetate
(
ROAc
)
,
and
N-
(
4-hydroxyphenyl
)
retinamide
(
4HPR
)
in
male
Sprague-Dawley
rats
maintained
on
diets
containing
different
levels
of
vitamin
K
.

Animals
were
fed
either
an
NIH-07
diet
supplemented
with
menadione
(
3
.
1
ppm
vitamin
K3
)
,
an
NIH-07
diet
not
supplemented
with
menadione
,
or
an
AIN-076
purified
diet
devoid
of
vitamin
K
.

The
retinoids
had
no
effect
on
prothrombin
times
of
animals
fed
the
supplemented
diet
.

When
menadione
was
omitted
from
the
diet
,
however
,
4HPR-dosed
animals
had
elevated
prothrombin
times
.

This
effect
was
observed
as
early
as
Day
7
and
was
accompanied
by
one
confirmed
hemorrhagic
death
.

13cisRA-dosed
animals
showed
no
change
in
prothrombin
times
.

In
the
high-dose
ROAc
group
,
there
was
a
twofold
increase
in
prothrombin
times
but
only
after
prolonged
dosing
.

In
animals
fed
the
NIH-07
diets
,
13cisRA
and
ROAc
induced
multiple
bone
fractures
at
all
dose
levels
.

In
contrast
,
4HPR
administered
at
the
highest
dose
induced
only
one
fracture
in
one
animal
.

Animals
fed
the
purified
diet
lost
weight
faster
and
diet
sooner
than
those
maintained
on
the
other
diets
.

Bone
fractures
were
not
observed
in
these
animals
because
of
early
deaths
resulting
from
hemorrhaging
.

For
all
retinoid-dosed
groups
maintained
on
the
purified
diet
,
changes
in
prothrombin
times
occured
as
early
as
1
week
.

The
order
of
effect
was
4HPR
greater
than
ROAc
greater
than
13cisRA
,
with
increases
in
prothrombin
times
correlating
with
increases
in
hemorrhagic
deaths
.

Hence
,
the
degree
of
retinoid-induced
hemorrhage
,
but
not
the
incidence
of
bone
fractures
,
was
inversely
related
to
vitamin
K
levels
in
the
diet
.

13cisRA
and
ROAc
,
but
not
4HPR
,
caused
a
dose-dependent
reduction
in
plasma
osteocalcin
,
an
effect
that
correlated
with
retinoid-induced
bone
effects
.

In
contrast
,
serum
alkaline
phosphatase
was
elevated
in
animals
dosed
with
13cisRA
or
4HPR
but
not
in
those
dose
with
ROAc
.

For
this
enzyme
,
the
electrophoretic
pattern
on
agarose
gel
showed
a
decrease
,
compared
to
controls
,
in
the
major
isozyme
in
serum
of
ROAc-dosed
animals
.

Hence
,
plasma
osteocalcin
is
a
better
predictor
of
retinoid-induced
bone
effects
than
serum
alkaline
phosphatase
.
Homocysteine
(
Hcy
)
is
thought
to
play
an
important
role
in
the
development
of
osteoporosis
and
fracture
.

Methionine
synthase
reductase
(
MTRR
)
is
an
enzyme
involved
in
the
conversion
of
Hcy
to
methionine
.

We
hypothesized
that
certain
genetic
polymorphisms
of
MTRR
leading
to
reduced
enzyme
activity
may
cause
hyperhomocysteinemia
and
affect
bone
metabolism
.

We
therefore
examined
the
associations
of
the
A66G
and
C524T
polymorphisms
of
the
MTRR
gene
with
bone
mineral
density
(
BMD
)
and
serum
osteocalcin
levels
in
postmenopausal
women
.

Although
we
did
not
detect
any
significant
associations
between
MTRR
polymorphisms
and
BMD
or
serum
osteocalcin
levels
,
we
found
that
the
66G
/
524C
haplotype
,
which
has
reduced
enzyme
activity
,
was
significantly
associated
with
serum
osteocalcin
levels
in
a
gene-dose
dependent
manner
(
P
=
0
.
002
)
.

That
is
,
the
highest
osteocalcin
levels
(
34
.
5
+
/
-
16
.
8
ng
/
ml
)
were
observed
in
subjects
bearing
two
copies
,
intermediate
osteocalcin
levels
(
32
.
6
+
/
-
14
.
4
ng
/
ml
)
were
observed
in
subjects
bearing
one
copy
,
and
the
lowest
levels
of
osteocalcin
(
28
.
8
+
/
-
10
.
9
ng
/
ml
)
were
observed
in
subjects
bearing
no
copies
.

These
results
suggest
that
the
66G
/
524C
haplotype
of
the
MTRR
gene
affect
bone
turn
over
rate
.
The
term
"Bartter's
syndrome"
comprises
a
set
of
autosomal
recessively
inherited
renal
tubular
disorders
characterized
by
hypokalemia
,
metabolic
alkalosis
,
hyperreninism
,
and
hyperaldosteronism
but
normal
blood
pressure
.

Additional
clinical
and
biochemical
features
led
to
a
classification
into
phenotypically
different
tubulopathies
:
Gitelman's
syndrome
,
hyperprostaglandin
E
syndrome
(
antenatal
Bartter's
syndrome
)
,
and
classic

.

Gitelman's

results
from

Genetic

has
been
demonstrated
by
identification
of
mutations

Exposure
to

in
C3H
mice

offspring
when
they
reach

.

To
help
define
the
molecular
events
associated
with
the
fetal
onset
of
arsenic
hepatocarcinogenesis
,
pregnant
C3H
mice
were
given
drinking
water
containing
0
(
control
)
or
85
ppm
arsenic
from
day
8
to
18
of
gestation
.

At
the
end
of
the
arsenic
exposure
period
,
male
fetal
livers
were
removed
and
RNA
isolated
for
microarray
analysis
using
22K
oligo
chips
.

Arsenic
exposure
in
utero
produced
significant
(
p<0
.
001
)
alterations
in
expression
of
187
genes
,
with
approximately
25%
of
aberrantly
expressed
genes
related
to
either
estrogen
signaling
or
steroid
metabolism
.

Real-time
RT-PCR
on
selected
genes
confirmed
these
changes
.

Various
genes
controlled
by
estrogen
,
including
X-inactive-specific
transcript
,
anterior
gradient-2
,
trefoil
factor-1
,
CRP-ductin
,
ghrelin
,
and
small
proline-rich
protein-2A
,
were
dramatically
over-expressed
.

Estrogen-regulated
genes
including
cytokeratin
1-19
and
Cyp2a4
were
over-expressed
,
although
Cyp3a25
was
suppressed
.

Several
genes
involved
with
steroid
metabolism
also
showed
remarkable
expression
changes
,
including
increased
expression
of
17beta-hydroxysteroid
dehydrogenase-7
(
HSD17beta7;
involved
in
estradiol
production
)
and
decreased
expression
of
HSD17beta5
(
involved
in
testosterone
production
)
.

The
expression
of
key
genes
important
in
methionine
metabolism
,
such
as
methionine
adenosyltransferase-1a
,
betaine-homocysteine
methyltransferase
and
thioether
S-methyltransferase
,
were
suppressed
.

Thus
,
exposure
of
mouse
fetus
to
inorganic
arsenic
during
a
critical
period
in
development
significantly
alters
the
expression
of
various
genes
encoding
estrogen
signaling
and
steroid
or
methionine
metabolism
.

These
alterations
could
disrupt
genetic
programming
at
the
very
early
life
stage
,
which
could
impact
tumor
formation
much
later
in

Frovatriptan
succinate
is
one
of
the
most
recent
serotonin
receptor
agonists
to
receive
FDA
,
approved
labelling
for
use
in
the
acute
management
of
migraine
with
or
without
aura
in
adults
.

The
mechanism
of
action
of
frovatriptan
is
thought
to
be
similar
to
that
of
a
serotonin
agonist
.

However
,
frovatriptan
has
distinctive
pharmacokinetic
and
pharmacologic
properties
,
chiefly
,
a
high
affinity
for
serotonin
receptors
1B
and
1D
and
a
long
elimination
half-life;
frovatriptan
was
shown
to
be
more
selective
for
cerebral
than
coronary
arteries
,
a
property
which
makes
frovatriptan
more
favourable
in
patients
at
risk
of
coronary
artery
disease
.

Additionally
,
frovatriptan
has
a
half-life
of
approximately
25
h
,
substantially
longer
than
that
of
any
other
agent
within
its
class
.

This
property
makes
frovatriptan
suitable
for
patients
who
typically
suffer
migraines
of
long
duration
and
/
or
those
who
suffer
migraine
recurrence
.

The
efficacy
of
frovatriptan
in
the
treatment
of
acute
migraine
was
demonstrated
in
five
double-blind
,
randomised
,
placebo-controlled
trials
.

At
2h
,
headache
response
rates
for
frovatriptan
2
.
5
mg
ranged
from
38
to
40%
compared
to
22-35%
for
placebo
.

Headache
recurrence
for
frovatriptan
2
.
5
mg
at
24h
ranged
from
9
to
14%
compared
with
18%
in
placebo
subjects
.

Frovatriptan
has
no
clinically
significant
pharmacokinetic
interactions
with
drugs
used
for
migraine
prophylaxis
or
with
commonly
prescribed
medications
.

Adverse
effects
of
frovatriptan
including
dizziness
,
paresthesia
,
dry
mouth
,
fatigue
and
flushing
were
generally
mild
and
well
tolerated
.

Given
the
fact
that
patient
response
to
serotonin
agonists
is
individualised
,
and
selecting
an
effective
agent
may
involve
trial
and
error
,
frovatriptan
is
a
welcome
alternative
in
the
acute
management
of
migraine
.
Fibrates
are
widely
used
drugs
which
lower
triglycerides
and
increase
HDL
concentrations
in
serum
.

Recent
findings
from
our
laboratory
have
shown
that
fibrates
repress
apolipoprotein
(
apo
)
CIII
gene
expression
,
an
effect
that
explains
partially
the
triglyceride-lowering
activity
of
these
drugs
.

The
goal
of
the
present
study
was
to
compare
the
effect
of
various
fibrates
on
apo
CIII
gene
expression
in
the
human
hepatoblastoma
cell
line
HepG2
.

First
,
we
demonstrate
that
the
level
of
apo
CIII
secretion
by
HepG2
cells
is
controlled
by
serum
factors
whereas
apo
CIII
mRNA
levels
are
not
and
even
increase
under
conditions
when
apo
CIII
secretion
dramatically
decreases
.

Twelve
different
fetal
calf
serum
batches
were
tested
during
this
study
and
apo
CIII
secretion
in
cell
medium
could
only
be
detected
with
three
of
them
.

The
effect
of
serum
on
apolipoprotein
secretion
was
more
pronounced
for
apo
CIII
whereas
other
apolipoproteins
(
apo
E
,
apo
B
,
apo
AII
and
apo
AI
)
were
affected
to
a
lesser
extent
.

Under
serum
conditions
allowing
apo
CIII
secretion
,
treatment
with
the
peroxisome-proliferator
activated
receptor
(
PPAR
)
alpha
activators
fenofibrate
,
gemfibrozil
and
Wy-14643
result
in
a
marked
lowering
of
apo
CIII
secretion
and
gene
expression
,
this
effect
being
most
pronounced
with
Wy-14643
.

Comparison
of
the
activity
of
a
PPARgamma-specific
ligand
,
the
antidiabetic
thiazolidinedione
,
BRL-49653
and
a
PPARalpha
ligand
Wy-14643
showed
a
marked
decrease
of
apo
CIII
secretion
and
gene
expression
after
activation
of
PPARalpha
but
not
PPARgamma
.

In
conclusion
,
fibrates
down-regulate
apo
CIII
gene
expression
in
human
HepG2
cells
,
most
likely
via
PPARalpha
but
not
via
PPARgamma
.

However
,
these
effects
are
only
observed
in
HepG2
cells
cultured
under
appropriate
conditions

OBJECTIVE
Impaired
insulin
sensitivity
increases
the
risk
of
cardiovascular
disease
.

Although
calorie
restriction
and
weight
loss
increase
insulin
sensitivity
,
the
effects
of
modifying
macronutrient
composition
on
insulin
sensitivity
are
uncertain
.

The
purpose
of
this
study
is
to
determine
the
effects
on
insulin
sensitivity
of
a
carbohydrate-rich
diet
(
CARB;
similar
to
the
Dietary
Approaches
to

]
diet
)
,
a
protein-rich
diet
(
PROT;
protein
predominantly
from
plant
sources
)
,
and
an
unsaturated

diet
(
UNSAT;
predominantly
monounsaturated
)
.

RESEARCH
DESIGN
AND
METHODS
This
study
was
a
randomized
,
controlled
,
three-period
,
crossover
feeding
study
.

The
study
participants
were
164
individuals
with
prehypertension
or
stage
1
hypertension
without
diabetes
.

Diets
were
administered
for
6
weeks
each
,
with
a
washout
period
between
diets
of
2-4
weeks
.

Weight
was
held
constant
throughout
the
study
.

For
our
primary
outcome
,
we
calculated
the
quantitative
insulin
sensitivity
check
index
(
QUICKI
)
using
the
end-of-period
fasting
serum
glucose
and
insulin
.

QUICKI
is
a
validated
measure
of
insulin
sensitivity
.

The
primary
analyses
used
generalized
estimating
equations
.

RESULTS
At

,
and
mean
(

)
QUICKI
was

.

The
UNSAT
diet
increased
QUICKI
by

,
more
than
the
CARB
diet
(
P

)
.

PROT
had
no
significant
effect
compared
with
CARB
.

CONCLUSIONS
A
diet
that
partially
replaces
carbohydrate
with
unsaturated
fat
may
improve
insulin
sensitivity
in
a
population
at
risk
for
cardiovascular
disease
.

Given
the
well-recognized
challenges
of
sustaining
weight
loss
,
our
results
suggest
an
alternative
approach
for
improving
insulin
sensitivity
.

Hypoxic

VHL-deficient
cells
use
glutamine
to
generate
citrate
and
lipids
through
reductive
carboxylation
(
RC
)
of
α-ketoglutarate
.

To
gain
insights
into
the
role
of
HIF
and
the
molecular
mechanisms
underlying
RC
,
we
took
advantage
of
a
panel
of
disease-associated
VHL
mutants
and
showed
that
HIF
expression
is
necessary
and
sufficient
for
the
induction
of
RC
in
human
renal
cell
carcinoma
(
RCC
)
cells
.

HIF
expression
drastically
reduced
intracellular
citrate
levels
.

Feeding
VHL-deficient
RCC
cells
with
acetate
or
citrate
or
knocking
down
PDK-1
and
ACLY
restored
citrate
levels
and
suppressed
RC
.

These
data
suggest
that
HIF-induced
low
intracellular
citrate
levels
promote
the
reductive
flux
by
mass
action
to
maintain
lipogenesis
.

Using
[

]
glutamine
,
we
demonstrated
in
vivo
RC
activity
in
VHL-deficient
tumors
growing
as
xenografts
in
mice
.

Lastly
,
HIF
rendered
VHL-deficient
cells
sensitive
to
glutamine
deprivation
in
vitro
,
and
systemic
administration
of
glutaminase
inhibitors
suppressed

growth
of
RCC
cells

,
incorporating
at

of
the

nucleus
a

moiety
,
were
the
most
powerful
inhibitors
of

and
inhibited
effectively

Analog
19
was
a
more
potent
anti-inflammatory
agent
than
the
reference
compound
indomethacin
and
of
comparable
cytocompatibility
to
8-MOP
whereas
analog
24
was
a
weaker
inhibitor
of
inflammation
than
indomethacin
and
significantly
more
cytotoxic
than
8-MOP
.

Gel

proved
to
be
the
key
step

The

was
sensitive

The
results
indicate
that
the

of

by
sanguinarine
is
independent
of
cell
viability
,
since
the

.

The
unsuccessful
recovery
of
[

candesartan
binding
after
washing
sanguinarine
off
the
cells
suggested
a
nearly
irreversible

interaction
.

Saturation

Antihypertensive
agents
are
proven
to
reduce
the
cardiovascular
risk
of
stroke
,
coronary
heart
disease
and
cardiac
failure
.

The
ideal
antihypertensive
agent
should
control
all
grades
of
hypertension
and
have
a
placebo-like
side
effect
profile
.

Angiotensin
II
(
AII
)
receptor
antagonists
are
a
relatively
new
class
of
antihypertensive
agent
that
block
AII
Type
1
(
AT
(
1
)
)
receptors
,
and
reduce
the
pressor
effects
of
AII
in
the
vasculature
.

By
this
mechanism
,
they
induce
similar
pharmacological
effects
compared
with
angiotensin-converting
enzyme
(
ACE
)
inhibitors
,
resulting
in
a
lowering
of
blood
pressure
.

However
,
AII
receptor
blockers
differ
from
ACE
inhibitors
with
respect
to
side
effects
,
and
induce
less
cough
,
a
side
effect
which
may
be
related
to
bradykinin
or
other
mediators
such
as
substance
P
.

Within
the
class
of
AII
blockers
,
eprosartan
differs
from
other
currently
available
agents
in
terms
of
chemical
structure
,
as
it
is
a
non-biphenyl
,
non-tetrazole
,
non-peptide
antagonist
with
a
dual
pharmacological
mode
of
action
.

Eprosartan
acts
at
vascular
AT
(
1
)
receptors
(
postsynaptically
)
and
at
presynaptic
AT
(
1
)
receptors
,
where
it
inhibits
sympathetically
stimulated
noradrenaline
release
.

Its
lack
of
metabolism
by
cytochrome
P450
enzymes
confers
a
low
potential
for
metabolic
drug
interactions
and
may
be
of
importance
when
treating
elderly
patients
and
those
on
multiple
drugs
.

In
clinical
trials
,
eprosartan
has
been
demonstrated
to
be
at
least
as
effective
in
reducing
blood
pressure
as
the
ACE
inhibitor
enalapril
,
and
has
significantly
lower
side
effects
.

Eprosartan
is
safe
,
effective
and
well-tolerated
in
long-term
treatment
,
either
as
a
monotherapy
or
in
combination
with
other
antihypertensive
drugs
such
as
hydrochlorothiazide
.
Pharmacological
treatment
for
overactive
bladder
has
centred
around
the
interruption
of
the
detrusor
activity
that
is
central
to
urge
and
incontinence
symptoms
.

The
majority
of
patients
with
this
disorder
are
treated
with
antimuscarinic
agents
.

These
drugs
have
been
demonstrated
to
improve
urgency
,
frequency
of
micturition
and
urge
incontinence
,
all
of
which
are
primary
symptoms
of
overactive
bladder;
however
,
they
are
also
commonly
associated
with
anticholinergic
adverse
effects
,
most
notably
dry
mouth
.

Attempts
to
increase
tolerability
have
included
the
development
of
advanced
formulations
that
regulate
release
of
the
active
ingredient
and
the
development
of
pharmacological
agents
that
target
the
desired
bladder
receptors
more
specifically
and
accurately
.

Although
all
agents
provide
good
efficacy
,
tolerability
is
greatly
affected
by
the
formulation
used
to
deliver
the
active
pharmacological
agent
,
as
well
as
the
specificity
of
the
targeted
receptors
.

Clinical
trials
involving
a
transdermal
formulation
of
oxybutynin
have
shown
that
this
delivery
method
may
be
associated
with
a
lower
incidence
of
anticholinergic
adverse
events
compared
with
both
the
immediate-release
and
the
extended-release
oral
formulations
of
traditional
agents
,
as
well
as
the
most
recently
approved
agents
-
trospium
chloride
,
solifenacin
and
darifenacin
.

Much
is
still
being
learned
about
the
function
and
specificity
of
muscarinic
receptors
,
which
will
support
the
development
of
agents
with
sustained
efficacy
and
enhanced
tolerability
compared
with
the
available
formulations
to
date
.

These
include
the
S-isomer
of
oxybutynin
,
as
well
as
selective
muscarinic
M2
receptor
antagonists
.
Sucralfate
is
a
site-protective
ulcer
healing
drug
with
a
remarkable
range
of
mechanisms
of
action
.

Recent
studies
highlight
the
capacity
of
sucralfate
to
bind
basic
fibroblast
growth
factor
(
bFGF
)
and
deliver
it
in
high
concentration
to
the
ulcer
.

Basic
fibroblast
growth
factor
stimulates
the
production
of
granulation
tissue
,
angiogenesis
and
re-epithelization
,
thus
improving
the
quality
of
ulcer
healing
.

The
effect
of
sucralfate
in
reducing
parietal
cell
sensitivity
may
be
another
factor
important
in
the
lower
relapse
rate
demonstrated
after
duodenal
ulcer
healing
.

Sucralfate
has
been
demonstrated
to
be
efficacious
in
healing
both
duodenal
and
gastric
ulcers
together
with
mild
oesophagitis
,
and
it
is
safe
for
both
short-term
use
and
maintenance
.

In
stress
ulcer
prophylaxis
it
is
as
effective
as
acid
suppression
or
neutralization
and
has
the
advantage
of
lesser
rates
of
nosocomial
pneumonia
than
are
demonstrated
with
antacids
or
H2
antagonists
.

The
potential
advantages
of
sucralfate
lie
in
the
better
quality
of
ulcer
healing
associated
with
longer
duration
of
remission
.

Brain
glutamate
/
glutamine
cycling
is
incomplete
without
return
of
ammonia
to
glial
cells
.

Previous
studies
suggest
that
alanine
is
an
important
carrier
for
ammonia
transfer
.

In
this
study
,
we
investigated
alanine
transport
and
metabolism
in
Guinea
pig
brain
cortical
tissue
slices
and
prisms
,
in
primary
cultures
of
neurons
and
astrocytes
,
and
in
synaptosomes
.

Alanine
uptake
into
astrocytes
was
largely
mediated
by
system
L
isoform
LAT2
,
whereas
alanine
uptake
into
neurons
was
mediated
by
Na

)
-dependent
transporters
with
properties
similar
to
system
B
(
0
)
isoform
B
(

AT2
.

To
investigate
the
role
of
alanine
transport
in
metabolism
,
its
uptake
was
inhibited
in
cortical
tissue
slices
under
depolarizing
conditions
using
the
system
L
transport
inhibitors
2-aminobicyclo

]
heptane-2-carboxylic
acid
and
cycloleucine
(
1-aminocyclopentanecarboxylic
acid;
cLeu
)
.

The
results
indicated
that
alanine
cycling
occurs
subsequent
to
glutamate
/
glutamine
cycling
and
that
a
significant
proportion
of
cycling
occurs
via
amino
acid
transport
system
L
.

Our
results
show
that
system
L
isoform
LAT2
is
critical
for
alanine
uptake
into
astrocytes
.

However
,
alanine
does
not
provide
any
significant
carbon
for
energy
or
neurotransmitter
metabolism

Recent
evidence
has
challenged
the
default
assumption
that
all
DNA-reactive
alkylating
agents
exhibit
a
linear
dose-response
.

Emerging
evidence
suggests
that
the
model
alkylating
agents
methyl-

methylnitrosourea
(

)
and
ethylnitrosourea
observe
a

.

Follow-up
mechanistic
studies
are
essential
to
understand
the
mechanism
of
cellular
tolerance
and
biological
relevance
of
such
NOGELs
.

MNU
is
one
of
the
most
mutagenic
simple
alkylators
.

Therefore
,
understanding
the
mechanism
of
mutation
induction
,
following
low-dose
MNU
treatment
,
sets
precedence
for
weaker
mutagenic
alkylating
agents
.

Here
,
we
tested
MNU
at

lower
concentrations
than
a

Cyclooxygenase
isozymes
(
COX-1
and
COX-2
)
are
found
to
be
constitutively
expressed
in
brain
,
with
neuronal
expression
of
COX-2
being
rapidly
induced
after
numerous
insults
,
including
cerebral
ischemia
.

Because
overactivation
of
N-methyl-D-aspartate
(
NMDA
)
receptors
has
been
implicated
in
the
cell
loss
associated
with
ischemia
,
we
characterized
the
expression
of
the
COX
isozymes
in
murine
mixed
cortical
cell
cultures
and
used
isozyme-selective
inhibitors
to
determine
their
relative
contribution
to
NMDA
receptor-stimulated
prostaglandin
(
PG
)
production
and
excitotoxic
neuronal
cell
death
.

Immunocytochemical
analysis
of
mixed
cortical
cell
cultures
revealed
that
COX-2
expression
was
restricted
to
neurons
,
whereas
COX-1
was
expressed
in
both
neurons
and
astrocytes
.

Brief
exposure
to
NMDA
(
5
min;
100
microM
)
elicited
a
time-dependent
accumulation
of
PGs
in
the
culture
medium
that
preceded
neuronal
cell
death
and
correlated
with
the
induction
of
COX-2
mRNA
.

COX-1
expression
remained
unchanged
.

Flurbiprofen
,
a
nonselective
COX-1
/
COX-2
inhibitor
,
blocked
NMDA-stimulated
PG
production
and
attenuated
neuronal
death
in
a
concentration-dependent
manner
.

Similar
results
were
obtained
with
the
specific
COX-2
inhibitor
NS-398
(
10-30
microM
)
but
not
with
the
selective
COX-1
inhibitor
valeryl
salicylate
(
10-300
microM
)
.

Inhibition

total
constitutive
COX
activity

aspirin
(

)
before
NMDA
exposure
did
not
prevent
subsequent
NMDA-mediated
neuronal
cell
death
.

However
,
neuronal
injury
in
aspirin-pretreated
cultures
was
attenuated
by
flurbiprofen
administration
after
NMDA
exposure
.

Finally
,
the
protection
afforded
by
COX-2
inhibition
was
specific
for
NMDA
because
neither
flurbiprofen
nor
NS-398
protected
neurons
against
kainate-mediated
neurotoxicity
.

Together
,
these
results
support
the
conclusion
that
newly
synthesized
COX-2
protein
contributes
to
NMDA-induced
neuronal
injury

The
extent
of
calcium
/
calmodulin-dependent
protein
kinase
II
(
CaMKII
)
inactivation
in
the
brain
following
ischemia
correlates
with
the
extent
of
damage
.

We
have
previously
shown
that
a
loss
of
CaMKII
activity
in
neurons
is
detrimental
to
neuronal
viability
by
inducing
excitotoxic
glutamate
release
.

In
the
current
study
,
we
extend
these
findings
to
show
that
the
ability
of
astrocytes
to
buffer
extracellular
glutamate
is
reduced
when
CaMKII
is
inhibited
.

Furthermore
,
CaMKII
inhibition
in
astrocytes
is
associated
with
the
rapid
onset
of
intracellular
calcium
oscillations
.

Surprisingly
,
this
rapid
calcium
influx
is
blocked
by
the
N-type
calcium
channel
antagonist
,
omega-conotoxin
.

While
the
function
of
N-type
calcium
channels
within
astrocytes
is
controversial
,
these
voltage-gated
calcium
channels
have
been
linked
to
calcium-dependent
vesicular
gliotransmitter
release
.

When
extracellular
glutamate
and
ATP
levels
are
measured
following
CaMKII
inhibition
within
our
enriched
astrocyte
cultures
,
no
alterations
in
glutamate
levels
are
observed
,
whereas
ATP
levels
in
the
extracellular
environment
significantly
increase
.

Extracellular
ATP
accumulation
associated
with
CaMKII
inhibition
contributes
both
to
calcium
oscillations
within
astrocytes
and
ultimately
cortical
neuron
toxicity
.

Thus
,
a
loss
of
CaMKII
signaling
within
astrocytes
dysregulates
glutamate
uptake
and
supports
ATP
release
,
two
processes
that
would
compromise
neuronal
survival

ischemic
/
excitotoxic
insults

These

perform
their

Due
to

DNA
topoisomerases
play
vital

and
thus
represent
an

.

The
aim
of
this
review
is
to
provide
an
overview
of
the
development
of
catalytic
inhibitors
of
the
human
topoisomerase
IIα
enzyme--an
important
member
of
the
DNA
topoisomerase
family--as
potential
novel
anticancer
agents
.

The
group
of
catalytic
topoII
inhibitors
is
classified
into
four
types
according
to
their
molecular
mechanism
of
action
:
inhibitors
that
bind
to
the
ATP
binding
site
,
inhibitors
that
prevent
the
ATP
hydrolysis
step
and
trap
the
enzyme
in
a
closed
clamp
,
inhibitors
that
block
the
DNA
cleavage
and
inhibitors
that
prevent
the
enzyme
binding
to
the
DNA
.

One
of
the
important
considerations
highlighted
throughout
this
review
is
the
structure-based
perspective
of
inhibitor
design
,
giving
the
reader
a
medicinal
chemist's
perspective
on
this
vibrant
and
active
field
of
drug
design
research
.
A
pharmacokinetic
/
pharmacodynamic
model
describing
receptor-mediated
effects
of
prednisolone
is
presented
.

The
basis
of
the
model
is
the
generally
accepted
mechanism
of
action
of
steroid
hormones
in
which
corticosteroids
bind
to
cytosolic
receptors
forming
steroid-receptor
complexes
,
which
are
activated
and
translocated
into
the
nucleus
.

There
the
complexes
associate
with
specific
DNA
sequences
and
modulate
the
rate
of
transcription
of
DNA
into
specific
RNAs
that
code
for
the
synthesis
of
proteins
that
elicit
biological
responses
.

Prednisolone
,
5

,
was
administered
intravenously
to
adrenalectomized
rats
.

Total

,
and
liver
prednisolone
concentrations
were
measured
simultaneously
with
free
hepatic
cytosolic
glucocorticoid
receptor
concentrations
and
tyrosine
aminotransferase
(
TAT
)
activity
of
the
liver
as
a
function
of
time
.

The
association
/
dissociation
kinetics
of
prednisolone
binding
to
the
glucocorticoid
receptor
were
measured
separately
in

at
37
degrees
C
.

Total
plasma
,
free
plasma
,
and
CBG-free
plasma
prednisolone
concentrations
could
be
used
equally
well
in
the
model
to
account
for
the
time
course
of
receptor
concentrations
and
TAT
activity
.

However
,
use
of
liver
steroid
concentrations
resulted
in
an
overestimation
of
receptor
depletion
.

Steroid
concentrations
in
plasma
increased
20
to
30-fold
with
a
tenfold
increase
in
dose
,
but
receptor
occupancy
and
TAT
activity
over
time
increased
about
threefold
.

While
prednisolone
pharmacokinetics
were
dose-dependent
,
parameters
describing
receptor
kinetics
and
TAT
activity
were
constant
at
each
prednisolone
dose
.

The
major
determinants
of
receptor-mediated
glucocorticoid
activity
are
confirmed
to
be
the
availability
of
the
receptor
,
drug-receptor
dissociation
rate
,
and
corticosteroid
persistence

the

GIRK2-mediated
currents
are
inhibited
by

whereas
in
the
absence
of
ACh
,
high
concentrations
of
halothane
induce
GIRK1

-mediated
currents
.

To
elucidate
the
molecular
mechanism
of
halothane
action
on
GIRK
currents
of
different
subunit
compositions
,
we
constructed
deletion
mutants
of
GIRK1

)
and
GIRK2
(

)
lacking
the
C-terminal
ends
,
as
well
as
chimeric
GIRK
channels
.

Mutated
GIRK
channels
showed
normal
currents
when
activated
by
ACh
but
exhibited
different
pharmacological
properties
toward
halothane
.

GIRK2
(
Delta356
)
showed
no
sensitivity
against
the
inhibitory
action
of
halothane
but
was
activated
by
halothane
in
the
absence
of
an
agonist
.

GIRK1
(
Delta363*
)
was
activated
by
halothane
more
efficiently
.

Currents
mediated
by
chimeric
channels
were
inhibited
by
anesthetic
concentrations
that
were
at
least
30-fold
lower
than
those
necessary
to
decrease
GIRK2
wild
type
currents
.

Glutathione
S-transferase
pulldown
experiments
did
not
show
displacement
of
bound
Gbetagamma
by
halothane
,
indicating
that
halothane
does
not
interfere
with
Gbetagamma
binding
.

Single
channel
experiments
revealed
an
influence
of
halothane
on
the
gating
of
the
channels
:
The
agonist-induced
currents
of
GIRK1
and
GIRK2
,
carried
mainly
by
brief
openings
,
were
inhibited
,
whereas
higher
concentrations
of
the
anesthetic
promoted
long
openings
of
GIRK1
channels
.

Because
the
C
terminus
is
crucial
for
these
effects
,
an
interaction
of
halothane
with
the
channel
seems
to
be
involved
in

The
potassium
channel
opener
diazoxide
has
hyperglycemic
and
hypotensive
properties
that
stem
from
its
ability
to
open
K
(
ATP
)
channels
in
pancreas
and
smooth
muscle
.

Diazoxide
is
believed
not
to
have
any
significant
action
on
cardiac
sarcolemmal
K
(
ATP
)
channels
.

Yet
,
diazoxide
can
be
cardioprotective
in
ischemia
and
has
been
found
to
bind
to
the
presumed
cardiac
sarcolemmal
K
(
ATP
)
channel-regulatory
subunit
,
SUR2A
.

became

.

This
effect
involved
specific
interactions
between
MgADP
and
SUR
,
as
it
required
Mg
(

)
,
but
not
ATP
,
and
was
abolished
by
point
mutations
in
the
second
nucleotide-binding
domain
of
SUR
,
which
impaired
channel
activation
by
MgADP
.

At
the
whole-cell
level
,
in
cardiomyocytes
treated
with
oligomycin
to
block
mitochondrial
function
,
diazoxide
could
also
activate
K
(
ATP
)
currents
only
after
cytosolic
ADP
had
been
raised
by
a
creatine
kinase
inhibitor
.

Thus
,
ADP
serves
as
a
cofactor
to
define
the
responsiveness
of
cardiac
K
(
ATP
)
channels
toward
diazoxide
.

The
present
demonstration
of
a
pharmacological
plasticity
of
K
(
ATP
)
channels
identifies
a
mechanism
for
the
control
of
channel
activity
in
cardiac
cells
depending
on
the
cellular
ADP
levels
,
which
are
elevated
under

However
,
the
in

effects
of
biotin

on
pancreatic

are
largely
unknown

In
the
present

,
we
investigated
whether
in

biotin
supplementation
in
the
diet
has
positive
effects
in
rodent
pancreatic

weeks
postweaning
and
tested
for

,
insulin

,

and

.

Insulin
secretion
increased
from
the
islets
of
biotin-supplemented
mice
,
together
with
the

RNA
(

expression
of
several

,
including

The

increased

Consistent

these

increased

.

Biotin

augmented
the

To

the

structure-activity
relationships
(
SARs
)
of
selective

(
NTS2
)
ligands
,
novel
peptide-peptoid
hybrids
that
simulate
the
function
of
the
endogenous
ligand
were
developed
.

Starting
from
our
recently
described
NTS2
ligands
of
type
1
,
structural
variants
of
type
2
and
the
metabolically
stable
analogues

,
b
were
developed
.

Replacement
of
the
proline
unit
by
a
collection
of
structural
surrogates
and
evaluation
of
the
respective
molecular
probes
for
NTS2
affinity
and
selectivity
indicated
similar
SARs
as
described
for
NT
(
8-13
)
derivatives
bound
to
the
subtype
NTS1
.

Peptide-peptoid

showed
substantial

binding
affinity
(
Ki

1-16
nM
)
and
2400-8600-fold
selectivity
over
NTS1
.

The
thiazolidine
derivative
3
b
showed
metabolic
stability
over
32
h
in
a
serum
degradation
assay
.

In
an
inositol

assay
,
the
neurotensin

displayed
an
inhibition
of

D-serine
,
an
endogenous
co-agonist
of
NMDA
receptors
in
vertebrate
retina
,
may
modulate
glutamate
sensitivity
of
retinal
neurons
.

This
study
determined
at
the
functional
and
molecular
level
the
transport
process
responsible
for
D-serine
in
retinal
Muller
cells
.

RT-PCR
and
immunoblotting
showed
that
serine
racemase
(
SR
)
,
the
synthesizing
enzyme
for
D-serine
,
is
expressed
in
the
rMC-1
Muller
cell
line
and
primary
cultures
of
mouse
Muller
cells
(
1
degrees
MCs
)
.

The
relative
contributions
of
different
amino
acid
transport
systems
to
d-serine
uptake
were
determined
based
on
differential
substrate
specificities
and
ion
dependencies
.

D-serine
uptake
was
obligatorily
dependent
on
Na
+
,
eliminating
Na
+
-independent
transporters
(
asc-1
and
system
L
)
for
D-serine
in
Muller
cells
.

The
Na
+
:
substrate
stoichiometry
for
the
transport
process
was
1
:
1
.

D-serine
transport
was
inhibited
by
alanine
,
serine
,
cysteine
,
glutamine
,
and
asparagine
,
but
not
anionic
amino
acids
or
cationic
amino
acids
,
suggesting
that
D-serine
transport
in
Muller
cells
occurs
via
ASCT2
rather
than
ASCT1
or
ATB0
,
+
.

The
expression
of
mRNAs
specific
for
ASCT1
,
ASCT2
,
and
ATB0
,
+
was
analyzed
by
RT-PCR
confirming
the
expression
of
ASCT2
(
and
ASCT1
)
mRNA
,
but
not
ATB0
,
+
,
in
Muller
cells
.

Immunoblotting
detected
ASCT2
in
neural
retina
and
in
1
degrees
MCs;
immunohistochemistry
confirmed
these
data
in
retinal
sections
and
in
cultures
of
1
degrees
MCs
.

The
efflux
of
D-serine
via
ASCT2
by
ASCT2
substrates
was
demonstrable
using
the
Xenopus
laevis
oocyte
heterologous
expression
system
.

These
data
provide
the
first
molecular
evidence
for
SR
and
ASCT2
expression
in
a
Muller
cell
line
and
in
1
degrees
MCs
and
suggest
that
D-serine
,
synthesized
in
Muller
cells
by
SR
,
is
effluxed
via
ASCT2
to
regulate
NMDA
receptors
in
adjacent
neurons
.
Hyperglycemia
slows
embryonic
growth
and
suppresses
cell
cycle
via
cyclin
D1
and
p21
.
This
study
describes
molecular
mechanisms
for
inhibiting
tumour
cell
proliferation
using
polysaccharides
from
medicinal
mushrooms
in
human
hepatoma
cells
.

The
results
show
that
regarding
cell
cycle-related
proteins
,
three
types
of
polysaccharides
significantly
enhance
the
expression
of
p27
(
Kip
)
in
HepG2
and
Bel-7404
cells
,
while
suppressing
the
activity
of
cyclin
D1
/
CDK4
and
/
or
cyclin
E
/
CDK2
.

Considering
apoptosis-related
factors
,
the
polysaccharides
suppressed
AKT
activity
through
the
inhibition
of
AKT
phosphorylation
at
Thr
(
308
)
and
/
or
Ser
(
473
)
.

The
growth
of
HepG2
and
Bel-7404
cells
was
suppressed
by
the
up-regulation
of
a
subunit
of
PI3K
and
phospho-PTEN
,
which
are
modulators
of
AKT
activity
.

The
polysaccharides
also
activated
the
mitochondria-mediated
apoptosis
pathway
by
stimulating
the
activation
of
Bcl-2
family
proteins
to
release
cytochrome
c
and
Smac
and
cleave
caspase-9
and
caspase-3
in
HepG2
and
Bel-7404
cells
.

These
factors
have
a
potent
effect
on
cell
cycle
arrest
in
G
(
1
)
and
/
or
S
phase
and
induce
apoptosis
in
HepG2
and
Bel-7404
cells
.
To
investigate
whether
polymorphisms
in
the
corticotrophin-releasing
hormone
(
CRH
)
promoter
are
associated
with
altered
CRH
gene
regulation
,
we
studied
the
reactivity
of
three
recently
described
promoter
variants
in
vitro
.

The
3625
bp
variants
A1B1
,
A2B1
and
A2B2
of
the
human
CRH
promoter
were
cloned
in
the
5'
region
to
a
luciferase
reporter
gene
and
transiently
transfected
into
both
mouse
anterior
pituitary
cells
AtT-20D16vF2
and
pheochromocytoma
cells
PC12
.

Incubation
with
8-Br-cAMP
alone
or
in
combination
with
cytokines
significantly
enhanced
the
promoter
activity
in
both
cell
lines
studied
by
up
to
22-fold
.

However
,
dexamethasone
antagonised
cAMP
effects
on
CRH
expression
in
AtT-20
cells
while
showing
no
effect
on
PC12
cells
,
indicating
that
tissue-specific
factors
play
a
crucial
role
.

Among
the
haplotypes
studied
,
A1B1
exhibited
the
greatest
reactivity
on
various
stimuli
.

Electric
mobility
shift
assay
(
EMSA
)
was
performed
to
study
whether
the
described
polymorphic
nucleotide
sequences
in
the
5'
region
of
the
hCRH
gene
interfere
with
binding
of
nuclear
proteins
.

A
specific
DNA
protein
complex
was
detected
at
position
-2353
bp
for
the
wild
type
sequence
only
,
possibly
interfering
with
a
binding
site
for
the
activating
transcription
factor
6
(
ATF6
)
.

Taken
together
,
this
is
the
first
study
to
demonstrate
that
CRH
promoter
reactivity
varies
between
the
compound
promoter
alleles
.
To
investigate
the
possible
drug
interaction
,
this
study
is
designed
to
evaluate
the
ability
of
Schisandrin
B
(
Sch
B
)
to
modulate
cytochrome
P450
3A
activity
(
CYP3A
)
in
vivo
and
to
alter
the
pharmacokinetic
profiles
of
CYP3A
substrate
(
midazolam
)
in
treated
rats
.

Rats
were
repeated
administered
with
physiological
saline
(
negative
control
group
)
,
ketoconazole
(
75mg
/
kg
,
positive
control
group
)
or
varied
doses
of
Sch
B
(
experimental
groups
)
for
three
consecutive
days
.

Subsequently
,
changes
in
hepatic
microsomal
CYP3A
activity
and
the
pharmacokinetic
profiles
of
midazolam
and
1'-hydroxy
midazolam
in
plasma
were
studied
to
evaluate
CYP3A
activity
.

The
results
indicated
that
Sch
B
significantly
dose-dependently
inhibited
rat
hepatic
microsomal
CYP3A
activity
with
Ki
value
of
16
.
64mg
/
kg
and
showed
the
characteristic
of
a
noncompetitive
inhibitor
.

Oral
administration
of
Sch
B
for
3
days
in
rats
produced
significant
effect
on
the
pharmacokinetics
of
oral
midazolam
.

Sch
B
resulted
in
a
significant
,
dose-dependent
increase
in
midazolam
AUC0-∞
except
at
the
dose
of
2mg
/
kg
,
while
AUC0-∞
increased
by
26
.
1%
(
8mg
/
kg
)
and
60
.
6%
(
16mg
/
kg
)
,
respectively
.

In
the
pharmacokinetic
profiles
of
1'-hydroxy
midazolam
,
the
significant
,
dose-dependent
decrease
in
AUC0-∞
was
observed
except
at
the
dose
of
2mg
/
kg
,
while
AUC0-∞
reduced
by
44
.
5%
(
8mg
/
kg
)
and
49
.
2%
(
16mg
/
kg
)
,
respectively
.

These
results
suggested
that
3-day
treatment
of
Sch
B
could
increase
concentration
and
oral
bioavailability
of
drug
metabolized
by
CYP3A
.

When
the
drug
,
consisting
of
Sch
B
,
is
used
in
the
clinic
for
more
than
3
days
,
the
possible
drug-drug
interactions
should
be
taken
into
consideration
.
Caloric
restriction
prolongs
the
lifespan
of
many
species
.

Therefore
,
investigators
have
researched
the
usefulness
of
caloric
restriction
for
healthy
lifespan
extension
.

Sirt1
,
an
NAD
(
+
)
-dependent
deacetylase
,
was
identified
as
a
molecule
necessary
for
caloric
restriction-related
anti-aging
strategies
.

Sirt1
functions
as
an
intracellular
energy
sensor
to
detect
the
concentration
of
NAD
(
+
)
,
and
controls
in
vivo
metabolic
changes
under
caloric
restriction
and
starvation
through
its
deacetylase
activity
to
many
targets
including
histones
,
nuclear
transcriptional
factors
,
and
enzymes
.

During
the
past
decade
,
investigators
have
reported
the
relationship
between
disturbance
of
Sirt1
activation
and
the
onset
of
aging-
and
obesity-associated
diseases
such
as
diabetes
,
cardiovascular
disease
and
neurodegenerative
disorders
.

Consequently
,
a
calorie
restriction-mimetic
action
of
Sirt1
is
now
expected
as
a
new
therapy
for
these
diseases
.

In
addition
,
recent
studies
have
gradually
clarified
the
role
of
Sirt1
in
the
onset
of
kidney
disease
.

Its
activation
may
also
become
a
new
target
of
treatment
in
the
patients
with
chronic
kidney
disease
including
diabetic
nephropathy
.

In
this
article
,
we
would
like
to
review
the
role
of
Sirt1
in
the
onset
of
kidney
disease
based
on
previous
studies
,
and
discuss
its
possibility
as
the
target
of
treatment
in
diabetic
nephropathy
.
Using
radioligand
binding
assays
,
we
determined
the
equilibrium
dissociation
constants
(
KD's
)
for
37
antidepressants
,
three
of
their
metabolites
(
desmethylcitalopram
,
desmethylsertraline
,
and
norfluoxetine
)
,
some
mood
stabilizers
,
and
assorted
other
compounds
(
some
antiepileptics

antagonists
,
benzodiazepines
,
psychostimulants
,
antihistamines
,
and
monoamines
)
for
the
human
serotonin
,
norepinephrine
,
and
dopamine
transporters
.

Among
the
compounds
that
we
tested
,
mazindol
was
the
most
potent
at
the
human
norepinephrine
and
dopamine
transporters
with
KD's
of
0
.
45
+

-
0
.
03
nM
and
8
.
1

4
nM
,
respectively
.

Sertraline
(
KD
=
25
+
/
-
2
nM
)
and
nomifensine
(
56
+
/
-
3
nM
)
were
the
two
most
potent
antidepressants
at
the
human
dopamine
transporter
.

We
showed
significant
correlations
for
antidepressant
affinities
at
binding
to
serotonin
(
R
=
0
.
93
)
,
norepinephrine
(
R
=
0

97
)
,
and
dopamine
(

87
)
transporters
in
comparison
to
their
respective
values
for
inhibiting
uptake
of
monoamines
into
rat
brain
synaptosomes
.

These
data
are
useful
in
predicting
some
possible
adverse
effects
and
drug-drug
interactions
of
antidepressants
and
related
compounds

To
better
define
the
mechanism
of
action
of
the
thiazolidinediones
,
we
incubated
freshly
isolated
human
adipocytes
with
rosiglitazone
and
investigated
the
changes
in
mRNA
expression
of
genes
encoding
key
proteins
of
adipose
tissue
functions
.

Rosiglitazone
(
10
(
-6
)
M
,
4
h
)
increased
p85alphaphosphatidylinositol
3-kinase
(
p85alphaPI-3K
)
and
uncoupling
protein-2
mRNA
levels
and
decreased
leptin
expression
.

The
mRNA
levels
of
insulin
receptor
,
IRS-1
,
Glut
4
,
lipoprotein
lipase
,
hormone-sensitive
lipase
,
acylation-stimulating
protein
,
fatty
acid
transport
protein-1
,
angiotensinogen
,
plasminogen
activator
inhibitor-1
,
and
PPARgamma1
and
gamma2
were
not
modified
by
rosiglitazone
treatment
.

Activation
of
RXR
,
the
partner
of
PPARgamma
,
in
the
presence
of
rosiglitazone
,
increased
further
p85alphaPI-3K
and
UCP2
mRNA
levels
and
produced
a
significant
augmentation
of
Glut
4
expression
.

Because
p85alphaPI-3K
is
a
major
component
of
insulin
action
,
the
induction
of
its
expression
might
explain
,
at
least
in
part
,
the
insulin-sensitizing
effect
of
the
thiazolidinediones
.

Quantitative
measurement
of
specific
protein
phosphorylation
sites
is
a
primary
interest
of
biologists
,
as
site-specific
phosphorylation
information
provides
insights
into
cell
signaling
networks
and
cellular
dynamics
at
a
system
level
.

Over
the
last
decade
,
selective
phosphopeptide
enrichment
methods
including
IMAC
and
metal
oxides
(
TiO2
and
ZrO2
)
have
been
developed
and
greatly
facilitate
large
scale
phosphoproteome
analysis
of
various
cells
,
tissues
and
living
organisms
,
in
combination
with
modern
mass
spectrometers
featuring
high
mass
accuracy
and
high
mass
resolution
.

Various
quantification
strategies
have
been
applied
to
detecting
relative
changes
in
expression
of
proteins
,
peptides
,
and
specific
modifications
between
samples
.

The
combination
of
mass
spectrometry-based
phosphoproteome
analysis
with
quantification
strategies
provides
a
straightforward
and
unbiased
method
to
identify
and
quantify
site-specific
phosphorylation
.

We
describe
common
strategies
for
mass

analysis
of
stable

as
well
as
two
widely

Rat

contains
a
saturable
,
high
affinity
binding
site
for
the
labelled
histamine
H1-antagonist
[

]
mepyramine
.

Nonlinear

analysis
of
the
performed

experiments
revealed
an

constant
(
Kd
)
of
7

.

Specific
binding
could
be
inhibited
completely
by
several
histaminergic
ligands
.

However
,
the
affinities
of
the
tested
H1-antagonists
other
than
mepyramine
for
this
binding
site
were
quite
low
and
the
known
stereospecificity
displayed
by
the
histamine
H1-receptor
for
the
enantiomers
of
chlorpheniramine
and
pheniramine
was
not
found
.

Moreover
,
the
H2-selective
agonist
4-methylhistamine
(
Ki
=
412
microM
)
was
even
more
potent
than
its
H1-selective
2-methylderivative
(
Ki
=
772
microM
)
.

Since
several
ethylenediamines
were
also
very
potent
in
displacing
[
3H
]
mepyramine
we
suggest
the
presence
of
an
ethylenediamine
recognition
site
on
rat
liver
plasma
membrane
which
is
unrelated
to
the
histamine
H1-receptor
.

It
is
stressed
that
a
proper
pharmacological
characterization
of
a
reported
binding
site
is
needed
,
since
we
show
in
this
study
that
[
3H

mepyramine
,
which
is
frequently
used
in
studies
concerning
the
H1-receptor
,

requires
a

catalyzes
the
insertion

Here
we
report
the
cloning
of
the
aba3
gene
from
Arabidopsis
thaliana
and
the
biochemical
characterization
of
the
purified
protein
.

ABA3
is
a
two-domain
protein
with
a
N-terminal
NifS-like
sulfurase
domain
and
a
C-terminal
domain
that
might
be
involved
in
recognizing
the
target
enzymes
.

Molecular
analysis
of
three
aba3
mutants
identified
mutations
in
both
domains
.

ABA3
contains
highly
conserved
binding
motifs
for
pyridoxal
phosphate
and
for
a
persulfide
.

The
purified
recombinant
protein
possesses
a
cysteine
desulfurase
activity
,
is
yellow
in
color
,
and
shows
a
NifS-like
change
in
absorbance
in
the
presence
of
L-cysteine
.

Pretreatment
of
ABA3
with
a
thiol-specific
alkylating
reagent
inhibited
its
desulfurase
activity
.

These
data
indicate
a
transsulfuration
reaction
similar
to
bacterial
NifS
.

In
a
fully
defined
in
vitro
system
,
the
purified
protein
was
able
to
activate
aldehyde
oxidase
by
using
L-cysteine
as
sulfur
donor
.

Finally
,
we
show
that
the
expression
of
the
aba3
gene
is
inducible
by
drought-stress
.

Active
Hexose

an
immunostimulatory
nutritional
supplement
.

AHCC
effects
and
mechanism
of
action
on
intestinal
epithelial
cells
or
monocytes
are
poorly
described
.

AHCC
was
added
to
the
culture
medium
of
intestinal
epithelial
cells
(
IEC18
and
HT29
cells
)
and
monocytes
(
THP-1
cells
)
and
assessed
the
secretion
of
proinflammatory
cytokines
by
ELISA
.

Inhibitors
of
NFκB
and

were
used
to
study
signal
transduction
pathways
while
TLR4
and
MyD88
were
silenced
in
IEC18
cells
using
shRNA
.

It
was
found
that
AHCC
induced
GROα
and
MCP1
secretion
in
IEC18
and
IL-8
in
HT29
cells
.

These
effects
depended
on
NFκB
activation
,
and
partly
on
MAPKs
activation
and
on
the
presence
of
MyD88
and
TLR4
.

In
THP-1
cells
AHCC
evoked
IL-8
,
IL-1β
and
TNF-α
secretion
.

The
induction
of
IL-8
depended
on
JNK
and
NFκB
activation
.

Therefore
,
AHCC
exerts
immunostimulatory
effects
on
intestinal
epithelial
cells
and

involving
TLR4
/
MyD88

It
has
been
reported
that
oligomeric
procyanidins
of
lotus
seedpod
(
LSOPC
)
is
effective
in
the
alleviation
of
Alzheimer's
disease
and
diabetes
through
its
antioxidant
and
insulin-potentiating
activities
.

This
study
investigated
the
anti-glycative
activity
of
LSOPC
in
a
bovine
serum
albumin
(
BSA
)
-glucose
model
.

The
level
of
glycation
and
conformational
alterations
were
assessed
by
specific
fluorescence
,
Congo
red
binding
assay
and
circular
dichroism
.

The
results
show
that
LSOPC
has
a
significant
anti-glycative
activity
in
vitro
and
it
can
also
effectively
protect
the
secondary
structure
of
BSA
during
glycation
.

LSOPC

.

The
structures
of
their
carbonyl
adducts
were
tentatively
identified
using

.

Their
capacity
to
scavenge
methylglyoxal
suggested
carbonyl
scavenging
as
a
major
mechanism
of
antiglycation
.

Therefore
,
LSOPC
could
be
helpful
to
prevent
AGEs-associated
diseases

with
the
potential
to
be
used
as

Descending
noradrenergic
inhibition
is
an
important
endogenous
pain-relief
mechanism
which
can
be
activated
by
local
glutamate
signaling
.

In
the
present
study
,
we
examined
the
effect
of
glutamate
transporter
activation
by
riluzole
in
the
regulation
of
activity
of
locus
coeruleus
(
LC
)
neurons
,
which
provide
the
major
inhibitory
descending
noradrenergic
projection
to
the
spinal

.

Local
injection
of
riluzole
into
the
LC
dose-dependently
reduced
hypersensitivity
in
rats
after
L5-L6
spinal
nerve
ligation
(
SNL
)
.

This
anti-hypersensitivity
effect
of
LC-injected
riluzole
was
blocked
by
intrathecal
administration
of
the
alpha2-adrenoceptor
antagonist
idazoxan
and
intra-LC
co-injection
of
the
AMPA

and
the

)

(
MEC
)
.

In
brainstem
slices
from
normal
rats
,
riluzole
increased
phosphorylated
cAMP

element
binding
protein
(
pCREB
)
expressing
nuclei
in
dopamine-beta-hydroxylase
(
DbetaH
)
containing

in
the
LC
.

This
riluzole-induced
pCREB
activation
in
LC
neurons
was
also
blocked
by
CNQX
and
CBX
.

In
the
primary
astrocyte
culture
,
riluzole
enhanced
glutamate-induced
glutamate
release
.

Contrary
to
expectations
,
these
results
suggest
that
activation
of
glutamate
transporters
in
the
LC
results
in
increase
of
extracellular
glutamate
signaling
,
possibly
via
facilitation
of
glutamate
release
from
astrocytes
,
and
activation
of
LC
neurons
to
induce
descending
inhibition
,
and
that
this
paradoxical
action
of
glutamate
transporters
in
the
LC
requires

.
Endometrial
cancer
is
associated
with
enhanced
cell
proliferation
due
to
high
concentrations
of
estrogens
,
and
decreased
cell
differentiation
due
to
low
levels
of
progesterone

.

It
is

The
human
members
of
the
aldo-keto
reductase
1B
(
AKR1B
)
subfamily
,
AKR1B1
and
AKR1B10
,
have
roles
in
these
processes
and
can
thus
be
implicated
in
endometrial
cancer
.

To
date
,
there
have
been
no
reports
on
the
expression
of
AKR1B1
in
endometrial
cancer
,
while
AKR1B10
has
only
been
studied
at
the
cellular
level
.

To
evaluate
the
roles
of
these
AKR1B
enzymes
,
we
investigated
expression
of
AKR1B1
and
AKR1B10
in
47
paired
samples
of
cancerous
and
adjacent
control
endometrium
at
the
mRNA
and
protein
levels
,
by
quantitative
PCR
,
Western
blotting
and
immunohistochemistry
staining
.

There
were
significantly
lower
mRNA
and
protein
levels
of
AKR1B1
in
cancerous
tissues
compared
to
adjacent
endometrium
.

The
gene
expression
of
AKR1B10
at
the
mRNA
level
was
significantly
increased
,
while
there
were
significantly
decreased
protein
levels
.

Immunohistochemistry
revealed
that
both
of
these
enzymes
were
present
in
all
of
the
samples
,
and
are
located
in
epithelial
cells
of
cancerous
and
control
endometrial
glands
.

Elevated
levels
in
adjacent
non-cancerous
tissues
imply
that
these
enzymes
are
more
important
in
the
initiation
of
endometrial
cancer
than
in
its
progression
.

To
the
best
of
our
knowledge
,
this
is
the
first
report
on
the
expression
of
AKR1B1
and
AKR1B10
in
endometrial
cancer
.

Further
studies
are
needed
to
define
the
precise
roles
of
these
enzymes
in
the
pathogenesis
of
endometrial
cancer

The
intrarenal
factors
responsible
for
hypertension
in
double-transgenic
rats
(
dTGR
)
harboring
human
renin
and
human
angiotensinogen
genes
are
unclear
.

The
pressure-natriuresis
and
-diuresis
relationships
in
response
to
chronic
angiotensin-converting
enzyme
(
ACE
)
inhibition
and
AT1
receptor
blockade
were
evaluated
.

Renal
renin-angiotensin
and
nitric
oxide
(
NO
)
system
gene
expression
was
also
investigated
.

Six-week-old
dTGR
were
treated
for
3
wk
with
submaximal
doses
of
cilazapril
(
10
mg
/
kg
,
orally
)
or
losartan
(
10
mg
/
kg
,
orally
)
or
with
the
drug
combination
.

In
untreated
dTGR
,
pressure-natriuresis
relationships
were
maximally
shifted
rightward
by
approximately
70
to
80
mmHg
,
and
both
renal
blood
flow
(
RBF
)
and
GFR
were
markedly
decreased
.

Submaximal
cilazapril
and
losartan
dosages
both
decreased
systolic
BP
by
30
mmHg
and
shifted
the
pressure-natriuresis
curves
leftward
by
25
to
30
mmHg
.

Cilazapril
increased
RBF
and
GFR
to
values
observed
in
normotensive
control
animals
but
did
not
significantly
affect
fractional
sodium
excretion
(
FENa
)
or
fractional
water
excretion
(
FEH2O
)
curves
.

In
contrast
,
losartan
had
no
significant
effect
on
RBF
or
GFR
but
shifted
the
FENa
and
FEH2O
curves
leftward
.

The
cilazapril
and
losartan
combination
completely
normalized
BP
and
shifted
the
pressure-natriuresis
curves
leftward
more
than
did
either
drug
alone
.

When
cilazapril
and
losartan
were
administered
at
higher
doses
(
30
mg
/
kg
,
orally
)
,
the
two
drugs
equally
shifted
the
pressure-natriuresis
curves
leftward
,
by
50
mmHg
.

Both
drugs
increased
RBF
and
GFR;
however
,
only
losartan
shifted
FENa
and
FEH2O
curves
leftward
.

Human
and
rat
renin
and
angiotensinogen
genes
were
downregulated
in
dTGR
and
were
increased
by
losartan
and
cilazapril
treatments
,
whereas
no
changes
in
the
expression
of
rat
ACE
and
AT1A
receptor
genes
were
observed
.

Endothelial
NO
synthase
expression
was
increased
by
cilazapril
but
not
by
losartan
.

Neither
inducible
NO
synthase
nor
neural
NO
synthase
gene
expression
was
affected
by
drug
treatments
.

Therefore
,
submaximal
ACE
inhibition
enhanced
sodium
excretion
mainly
by
increasing
RBF
and
GFR
,
whereas
submaximal
AT1
receptor
blockade
decreased
tubular
sodium
and
water
reabsorption
.

The
combination
of
the
two
drugs
produced
an
additive
effect
.

The
ACE
inhibitor
effects
may
involve
increased
endothelial
NO
synthase
expression
,
perhaps
related
to
the
inhibition
of
bradykinin
degradation
.

It
has
been
suggested
that
some
contraceptive
derivatives
of
19-nor-testosterone
possess
estrogenic
activity
that
may
facilitate
the
development
of
breast
cancer
.

The
aim
of
this
work
was
to
investigate
the
estrogenic
properties
of
norethisterone
(
NET
)
and
its
A-ring-reduced
derivatives
by
determining
progesterone
receptor
(
PR
)
and
c-fos
mRNA
content
of
two
estrogen-regulated
genes
in
the
uterus
of
ovariectomized
rats
.

mRNA
content
was
evaluated
by
Northern
blot
1-6
h
after
17
beta-estradiol
administration
.

The
highest
PR
and
c-fos
mRNA
content
was
observed
3
h
and
2
h
after
17
beta-estradiol
administration
,
respectively
.

NET
did
not
modify
either
PR
or
c-fos
mRNA
content
.

In
contrast
,
5
alpha-
and
3
beta
,
5
alpha-NET
significantly
increased
mRNA
content
of
both
genes
.

The
increase
in
c-fos
mRNA
content
induced
by
these
reduced
compounds
was
lower
than
that
found
with
estradiol
treatment
.

The
overall
results
indicate
that
NET
administration
can
indirectly
induce
estrogenic
effects
through
the
action
of
its
5
alpha-dihydro
and
3
beta
,
5

derivatives

To
determine
the
factors
that
influence
the
interaction
between
phenoxybenzamine
and
calmodulin
,
the
binding
of
phenoxybenzamine
to
calmodulin
was
determined
by
equilibrium
dialysis
under
a
variety
of
experimental
conditions
.

This
interaction
was
found
to
be
similar
in
some
respects
to
the
interaction
between
phenothiazines
and
calmodulin
.

It
was
saturable
,
with
between
1
and
2
mol
of
phenoxybenzamine
bound
to
1
mol
of
calmodulin
.

It
was
also
dependent
upon
temperature
,
the
presence
of
a
divalent
cation
such
as
calcium
,
and
on
pH
,
showing
maximum
binding

6
.
5
with
little
binding
at
pH
values
below
4
.
2
or
above

.
0
.

The
site
at
which
phenoxybenzamine
bound
to
calmodulin
appears
to
be
similar
to
that
at
which
certain
antipsychotic
agents
bind
,
since
several
of
them
,
including
penfluridol
,
pimozide
and
spiroperidol
,
prevented
the
binding
of
phenoxybenzamine
to
calmodulin
.

However
,
in
contrast
to
the
reversible
binding
of
most
phenothiazines
to
calmodulin
,
phenoxybenzamine
bound
to
calmodulin
irreversibly
.

The
binding
of
phenoxybenzamine
to
calmodulin
was
fairly
selective
in
that
other
alpha-adrenergic
agents
such
as
prazosin
,
yohimbine
and
clonidine
failed
to
bind
to
calmodulin
when
examined
under
the
same
experimental
conditions
.

In
addition
,
phenoxybenzamine
showed
little
or
no
calcium-dependent
binding
to
the
S-100
protein
,
bovine
serum
albumin
or
cytochrome
c
.

The
irreversible
complex
between
phenoxybenzamine
and
calmodulin
may
be
useful
for
inhibiting
certain
calmodulin-dependent
reactions
and
for
studying
the
various
biological
functions

for

in

for
the

of

.

Previous
study
in
our
laboratory
demonstrated
that
CPC
and
CPA
had
different
anti-diarrheal
,
anti-bacterial
and
anti-inflammatory
effects
.

In
this
present
study
,
we
aimed
to
compare
the
protective
effect
of
ethanol
extract
of
Cortex
Phellodendri
chinensis
(
ECPC
)
and
Cortex
Phellodendri
Amurensis
(

)
against
beta-amyloid
(
Aβ
)
-induced
neurotoxicity
in
PC12
cells
,
a
typical
model
of
Alzheimer's
disease
.

The
results
showed
that
ECPC
and
ECPA
contain
four
common
chemical
markers
such
as
berberine
,
but
palmatine
and
jatrorrhizin
were
not
found
in
CPC
in
contrast
to
the
presence
in
CPA
.

In
addition
,
both
ECPC
and
ECPA
can
significantly
increase
the
cell
viability
in
Aβ-treated
PC12
cells
.

Moreover
,
ECPC
and
ECPA
can
markedly
elevate
the
ratio
of
the
protein
and
mRNA
levels
of
Bcl-2
/
Bax
,
while
remarkably
decrease
the
release
of
cytochrome
c
,
and
the
protein
and
mRNA
expression
of
caspase-3
.

Interestingly
,
ECPA
has
better
protective
effect
than
ECPC
against
Aβ-induced
neurotoxicity
in
PC12
cells
.

These
results
indicate
that
both
ECPC
and
ECPA
have
potential
protective
effect
against
Aβ-induced
neurotoxicity
in
PC12
cells
,
and
ECPA
is
more
potential
of
the
two
species
to
be
used
in
traditional
medicine
as
a
neuroprotective
agent
for
the
treatment
of
AD
.

The
neuroprotective
effect
of
the
two
species
may
be
mediated
,
at
least
in
part
,
via
suppressing
of
the
cellular
apoptosis

Rosiglitazone
is
an
insulin-sensitizing
agent
that
has
recently
been
shown
to
exert
beneficial
effects
on
atherosclerosis
.

In
addition
to
peroxisome
proliferator-activated
receptor
(
PPAR
)
-gamma
,
rosiglitazone
can
affect
other
targets
,
such
as
directly
inhibiting
recombinant
long-chain
acyl-CoA
synthetase
(
ACSL
)
-4
activity
.

Because
it
is
unknown
if
ACSL4
is
expressed
in
vascular
cells
involved
in
atherosclerosis
,
we
investigated
the
ability
of
rosiglitazone
to
inhibit
ACSL
activity
and
fatty
acid
partitioning
in
human
and
murine
arterial
smooth
muscle
cells
(
SMCs
)
and
macrophages
.

Human
and
murine
SMCs
and
human
macrophages
expressed
Acsl4
,
and
rosiglitazone
inhibited
Acsl
activity
in
these
cells
.

Furthermore
,
rosiglitazone
acutely
inhibited
partitioning
of
fatty
acids
into
phospholipids
in
human
SMCs
and
inhibited
fatty
acid
partitioning
into
diacylglycerol
and
triacylglycerol
in
human
SMCs
and
macrophages
through
a
PPAR-gamma-independent
mechanism
.

Conversely
,
murine
macrophages
did
not
express
ACSL4
,
and
rosiglitazone
did
not
inhibit
ACSL
activity
in
these
cells
,
nor
did
it
affect
acute
fatty
acid
partitioning
into
cellular
lipids
.

Thus
,
rosiglitazone
inhibits
ACSL
activity
and
fatty
acid
partitioning
in
human
and
murine
SMCs
and
in
human
macrophages
through
a
PPAR-gamma-independent
mechanism
likely
to
be
mediated
by
ACSL4
inhibition
.

Therefore
,
rosiglitazone
might
alter
the
biological
effects
of
fatty
acids
in
these
cells
and
in
atherosclerosis
.

Pinosylvin
,
a
naturally
occurring
trans-stilbenoid
mainly
found
in
Pinus
species
,
has
exhibited
a
potential
cancer
chemopreventive
activity
.

However
,
the
growth
inhibitory
activity
against
cancer
cells
and
the
underlying
molecular
mechanisms
remain
to
be
elucidated
.

Therefore
,
the
anti-proliferative
activity
of
pinosylvin
was
investigated
in
human
colorectal
HCT
116
cancer
cells
.

Pinosylvin
inhibited
the
proliferation
of
HCT
116
cells
by
arresting
transition
of
cell
cycle
from
G1
to
S
phase
along
with
the
downregulation
of
cyclin
D1
,
cyclin
E
,
cyclin
A
,
cyclin
dependent
kinase
2
(
CDK2
)
,
CDK4
,
c-Myc
,
and
retinoblastoma
protein
(
pRb
)
,
and
the
upregulation
of
p21
(
WAF1
/
CIP1
)
and
p53
.

Pinosylvin
was
also
found
to
attenuate
the
activation
of
proteins
involved
in
focal
adhesion
kinase
(
FAK
)
/
c-Src
/
extracellular
signal-regulated
kinase
(
ERK
)
signaling
,
and
phosphoinositide
3-kinase
(
PI3K
)
/
Akt
/
glycogen
synthase
kinase
3β
(
GSK-3β
)
signaling
pathway
.

Subsequently
,
pinosylvin
suppressed
the
nuclear
translocation
of
β-catenin
,
one
of
downstream
molecules
of
PI3K
/
Akt
/
GSK-3β
signaling
,
and
these
events
led
to
the
sequential
downregulation
of
β-catenin-mediated
transcription
of
target
genes
including
BMP4
,
ID2
,
survivin
,
cyclin
D1
,
MMP7
,
and
c-Myc
.

These
findings
demonstrate
that
the
anti-proliferative
activity
of
pinosylvin
might
be
associated
with
the
cell
cycle
arrest
and
downregulation
of
cell
proliferation
regulating
signaling
pathways
in
human
colorectal
cancer
cells
.

injection
of
either

ICI
at

on
the

at

on
the
day
of

of
metaestrus
.

Estradiol
(
E2
)
and
progesterone
(
P4
)
plasma
levels
were
measured
by
radioimmunoassay
.

Both
ICI
treatments
,
induced
a
significant
decrease
(
p<0

)
in
uterine
estrogen
receptor
alpha
(
ERα
)
content
,
had
no
effect
on

and
caused

nuclear
localization
of
cyclin
D1
,
in
both
luminal
and
glandular
uterine
epithelium
,
as
compared
to
vehicle-treated
animals
.

Furthermore
,
we
detected
that
ICI
treatment
induced
glycogen
synthase
kinase
(
Gsk3-β
)
Ser
9
phosphorylation
,
which
correlates
with
cyclin
D1
nuclear
localization
.

However
,
some
differences
were
observed
between
the
two
different
time
schedules
of
administration
.

We
observed
that
the
administration
of
ICI
at
08
:
00h
on
proestrus
day
produced
a
15%
inhibition
of
luminal
epithelial
cell
proliferation
,
reduced
uterine
wet
weight
by
21%
and
caused
reduction
of
Akt
phosphorylation
at
Ser
473
as
compared
to
vehicle-treated
animals
,
whereas
ICI
treatment
at
00
:
00h
on
estrus
day
had
no
effect
on
these
parameters
.

The
overall
results
indicate
that
ICI
may
exert
agonistic
and
antagonistic
effects
on
uterine
cell
proliferation
through
differential
activation
of
the
Akt
pathway
depending
on
the
administration
period
during
the
estrous
cycle
,
and
indicates
that
the
mechanism
of
cell
proliferation
during
the
physiological
conditions
of
the
estrous
cycle
,
is
under
a
different
and
more
complex
regulation
than
in
the
ovariectomized

Both
tacrolimus
(

)
and
sirolimus
(
SRL
)
bind
to
the
same
immunophilin
FKBP12;
however
,
their
mechanisms
of
action
are
distinct
.

SRL
inhibits
mammalian
target
of
rapamycin
(
TOR
)
,
which
is
an
enzyme
critical
to
the
immune
function
.

TOR
inhibition
blocks
the
signal
that
mediates
T-cell
proliferation
by
preventing
cell-cycle
progression
from
G1
to
S
phase
.

Moreover
,
TOR
inhibition
results
in
a
decrease
in
antibody
production
by
blocking
B-cell
proliferation
and
maturation
into
antibody
producing
cells
.

The
use
of
SRL
has
resulted
in
a
decrease
in
the
number
of
rejection
episodes
.

As
with
other
immunosuppressive
agents
,
SRL
can
cause
dose-related
side
effects
,
the
most
notable
of
which
are
hypercholesterolemia
,
hyperlipidemia
,
anemia
,
and
thrombocytopenia
.

Thus
,
therapeutic
drug
monitoring
to
assess
efficacy
and
toxicity
has
became
a
necessity
.

SRL
blood
levels
do
not
correlate
with
its
bioactivity
and
are
affected
by
the
concomitant
use
of
other
immunosuppressive
drugs
.

To
determine
the
bioactivity
of
SRL
we
have
developed
an
assay
to
determine
the
level
of
Sirolimus
per
lymphocyte
of
transplant
patients
.

The
levels
were
correlated
with
lymphocyte
count
.

METHODS
:
Whole
blood
samples
from

were
collected
in
Ethylene
Diamine
Tetra-acetic

.

Immediately
the

,
by

(

,
which
was
then
added
to

.

The
cytoplasmic
SRL
concentrations
in
lymphocytes
were
measured
using
kits
supplied
from
Abbott
diagnostics
or
by
high-performance
liquid

.

A
corresponding
whole
blood
sample
from
each
patient
was
used
to
measure
blood
levels
.

To
determine
the
level
per
lymphocyte
,
the
value
obtained
was
divided
by
the
number
of
lymphocytes
and
expressed
as
Pg
/
cell
.

A
pharmacokinetic
profile
for
both

was
constructed
for

was
performed

The
compound
class
of
3-carboranyl
thymidine
analogues
(
3CTAs
)
are
boron
delivery
agents
for
boron
neutron
capture
therapy
(
BNCT
)
,
a
binary
treatment
modality
for
cancer
.

Presumably
,
these
compounds
accumulate
selectively
in
tumor
cells
via
intracellular
trapping
,
which
is
mediated
by
hTK1
.

Favorable
in
vivo
biodistribution
profiles
of
3CTAs
led
to
promising
results
in
preclinical
BNCT
of
rats
with
intracerebral
brain
tumors
.

This
review
presents
an
overview
on
the
design
,

,
and
biological
evaluation
of
first-
and
second-generation
3CTAs
.

Boronated
nucleosides
developed
prior

3CTAs
for
BNCT
and
non-boronated
N3-substituted

are
also
described

basic
features
of

,
which
are
used

and
the

MELANOTAN
(
NDP-MSH
)
binds
the
MC1
receptor
to
significantly
increase
the
eumelanin
content
of
human
skin
cells
.

In
this
study
of
77
Caucasian
individuals
,
we
investigated
the
effects
of
MELANOTAN
in
individuals
with
variant
MC1R
genotypes
,
as
it
has
been
suggested
through
in
vitro
studies
that
variant
alleles
decrease
MELANOTAN
binding
efficacy
,
which
would
subsequently
affect
the
synthesis
of
melanin
.

Administration
of
MELANOTAN
produced
a
significant
(
p<0
.
001
)
increase
in
melanin
density
in
treated
,
compared
to
placebo
,
individuals
.

Importantly
,
MELANOTAN
increased
the
melanin
density
to
a
greater
extent
in
individuals
carrying
the
variant
alleles
Val60Leu
,
Asp84Glu
,
Val92Met
,
Arg142His
,
Arg151Cys
,
and
Arg160Trp
than
in
individuals
with
no
variant
alleles
.

This
study
demonstrates
that
MELANOTAN
effectively
increases
the
melanin
content
of
skin
in
those
individuals
with
MC1R
variant
alleles
and
therefore
,
those
most
in
need
of
photoprotection
.
Since
the
identification
of
LRP5
as
the
causative
gene
for
the
osteoporosis
pseudoglioma
syndrome
(
OPPG
)
as
well
as
the
high
bone
mass
(
HBM
)
phenotype
,
LRP5
and
the
Wnt
/
β-catenin
signaling
have
been
extensively
studied
for
their
role
in
the
differentiation
and
proliferation
of
osteoblasts
,
in
the
apoptosis
of
osteoblasts
and
osteocytes
and
in
the
response
of
bone
to
mechanical
loading
.

However
,
more
recently
the
direct
effect
of
LRP5
on
osteoblasts
and
bone
formation
has
been
questioned
.

Gene
expression
studies
showed
that
mice
lacking
lrp5
have
increased
expression
of
tph1
,
the
rate
limiting
enzyme
for
the
production
of
serotonin
in
the
gut
.

Furthermore
mice
lacking
either
tph1
or
htr1B
,
the
receptor
for
serotonin
on
the
osteoblasts
,
were
reported
to
have
an
increased
bone
mass
due
to
increased
bone
formation
.

This
led
to
the
still
controversial
hypothesis
that
LRP5
influences
bone
formation
indirectly
by
regulating
the
expression
of
thp1
and
as
a
consequence
influencing
the
production
of
serotonin
in
the
gut
.

Based
on
these
data
we
decided
to
evaluate
the
role
of
TPH1
and
HTR1B
in
the
development
of
craniotubular
hyperostoses
,
a
group
of
monogenic
sclerosing
bone
dysplasias
.

We
screened
the
coding
regions
of
both
genes
in
53
patients
lacking
a
mutation
in
the
known
causative
genes
LRP5
,
LRP4
and
SOST
.

We
could
not
find
disease-causing
coding
variants
in
neither
of
the
tested
genes
and
therefore
,
we
cannot
provide
support
for
an
important
function
of
TPH1
and
HTR1B
in
the
pathogenesis
of
sclerosing
bone
dysplasias
in
our
tested
patient
cohort
.
Sequence
analysis
of
mitochondrial
and
nuclear
candidate
genes
of
complex
I
in
children
with
deficiency
of
this
complex
and
exhibiting
Leigh-like
syndrome
has
revealed
,
in
one
of
them
,
a
novel
mutation
in
the
NDUFS4
gene
encoding
the
18
kDa
subunit
.

Phosphorylation
of
this
subunit
by
cAMP-dependent
protein
kinase
has
previously
been
found
to
activate
the
complex
.

The
present
mutation
consists
of
a
homozygous
G-->A
transition
at
nucleotide
position
+
44
of
the
coding
sequence
of
the
gene
,
resulting
in
the
change
of
a
tryptophan
codon
to
a
stop
codon
.

Such
mutation
causes
premature
termination
of
the
protein
after
only
14
amino
acids
of
the
putative
mitochondrial
targeting
peptide
.

Fibroblast
cultures
from
the
patient
exhibited
severe
reduction
of
the
rotenone-sensitive
NADH-->UQ
oxidoreductase
activity
of
complex
I
,
which
was
insensitive
to
cAMP
stimulation
.

Two-dimensional
electrophoresis
showed
the
absence
of
detectable
normally
assembled
complex
I
in
the
inner
mitochondrial
membrane
.

These
findings
show
that
the
expression
of
the
NDUFS4
gene
is
essential
for
the
assembly
of
a
functional
complex
I
.
Despite
the
progress
made
in
the
development
of
cardiopulmonary
bypass
(
CPB
)
equipment
,
systemic
anticoagulation
with
unfractionated
heparin
and
post-bypass
neutralization
with
protamine
are
still
used
in
most
perfusion
procedures
.

However
,
there
are
a
number
of
situations
where
unfractionated
heparin
,
protamine
or
both
cannot
be
used
for
various
reasons
.

Intolerance
of
protamine
can
be
addressed
with
extracorporeal
heparin
removal
devices
,
perfusion
with
(
no
)
low
systemic
heparinization
and
,
to
some
degree
,
by
perfusion
with
alternative
anticoagulants
.

Various
alternative
anticoagulation
regimens
have
been
used
in
cases
of
intolerance
to
unfractionated
heparin
,
including
extreme
hemodilution
,
low
molecular
weight
heparins
,
danaparoid
,
ancrod
,
r-hirudin
,
abciximab
,
tirofiban
,
argatroban
and
others
.

In
the
presence
of
heparin-induced
thrombocytopenia
(
HIT
)
and
thrombosis
,
the
use
of
r-hirudin
appears
to
be
an
acceptable
solution
which
has
been
well
studied
.

The
main
issue
with
r-hirudin
is
the
difficulty
in
monitoring
its
activity
during
CPB
,
despite
the
fact
that
ecarin
coagulation
time
assessment
is
now
available
.

A
more
recent
approach
is
based
on
selective
blockage
of
platelet
aggregation
by
means
of
monoclonal
antibodies
directed
to
GPIIb
/
IIIa
receptors
(
abciximab
)
or
the
use
of
a
GPIIb
/
IIIa
inhibitor
(
tirofiban
)
.

An
80%
blockage
of
the
GPIIb
/
IIIa
receptors
and
suppression
of
platelet
aggregation
to
less
than
20%
allows
the
giving
of
unfractionated
heparin
and
running
CPB
in
a
standard
fashion
despite
HIT
and
thrombosis
.

Likewise
,
at
the
end
of
the
procedure
,
unfractionated
heparin
is
neutralized
with
protamine
as
usual
and
donor
platelets
are
transfused
if
necessary
.

GPIIb
/
IIIa
inhibitors
are
frequently
used
in
interventional
cardiology
and
,
therefore
,
are
available
in
most
hospitals
.
High

This

genes
involved
in
regulation
of
glucose

with
either
the

In

In

,
the

in
determining
the

Phospholipase
A2
(
PLA2
)
has
been
postulated
to
play
a
role
in
the
regulation
of
cytokine
expression
.

Therefore
,
the
objective
of
the
present
study
was
to
investigate
the
effects
of
PLA2
inhibitors
p-bromophenacyl
bromide
(
BPB
)
and
arachidonyl
trifluoromethyl
ketone
(
AACOCF3
)
on
interleukin-2
(
IL-2
)
expression
in
murine
primary
splenocytes
.

Pretreatment
of
the
splenocytes
with
both
BPB
and
AACOCF3
suppressed
phorbol
12-myristate
13-acetate
plus
ionomycin-induced
IL-2
secretion
in
a
concentration-dependent
manner
.

Inhibition
>
90%
of
IL-2
secretion
was
observed
at
1
microM
BPB
and
10
microM
AACOCF3
compared
to
the
respective
vehicle
control
.

Likewise
,
IL-2
steady-state
mRNA
expression
was
inhibited
by
both
PLA2
inhibitors
in
a
concentration-dependent
fashion
with
>
90%
inhibition
at
1
microM
BPB
and
20
microM
AACOCF3
.

Taken
together
,
these
data
demonstrated
that
PLA2
inhibitors
BPB
and
AACOCF3
are
robust
inhibitors
of
IL-2
expression
at
both
the
mRNA
and
protein
levels
in
murine
splenocytes
.

Moreover
,
these
findings
suggest
that
drugs
and
chemicals
which
inhibit
PLA2
may
have
marked
effects
on
T-cell
function
.
Aspirin

drugs
,
which
are
cyclooxygenase

,
precipitate
asthmatic

in

patients
,
while
sodium
salicylate
,
hardly
active
on
COX
by
itself
,
is
well
tolerated
by
these
patients
.

However
,
salicylate
moiety
appears
to
interfere
with
aspirin
inhibitory
action
on
platelets
and
vascular
COX
.

Such
interaction
,
if
present
at
the
level
of
respiratory
tract
,
may
be
of
interest
to
pathogenesis
of
ASA-induced
asthma
.

We
performed
a
double-blind
,
placebo-controlled
,
randomized
cross-over
study
on
the
effect
of
choline
magnesium
trisalicylate
(

)
pre-treatment
on
ASA-induced
adverse
reactions
in
nine
patients
.

Pulmonary

tests
,
nasal
symptoms
score
,
PNIF
and
serum
salicylate
levels
were
monitored
following
challenges
with
threshold
doses
of
ASA
.

Trilisate
administered
at
a
dose
of
3000
mg
daily
for
3
days
,
offered
a
moderate
protection
against
ASA-induced
symptoms;
it
diminished
the
severity
and
/
or
delayed
the
appearance
of
FEV1
fall
.

Maximal
decreases
in
FEV1
as
well
as
reaction
intensity
indexes
were
significantly
lower
(
P
less
than

and
P

,
respectively
)
after
trilisate
pre-treatment
as
compared
to

.

Trilisate

attenuated
nasal

in
three
out
of
five
patients
.

Although
the
precise
mechanism
of
the
protective
action
of
trilisate
is
unknown
,
our
data
support
the
possibility
of
interaction
between
salicylate

Recent

suggests
atypical

are
required
for
both
TNF-

VEGF-induced
breakdown
of
the
blood-retinal

)

A

revealed
a
series
of
novel
small
molecule
phenylthiophene
based
inhibitors
of
aPKC
isoforms
that
effectively
block
permeability
in
cell
culture
and
in

.

In
an
effort
to
further
elucidate
the
structural
requirements
of
this
series
of
inhibitors
,
we
detail
in
this
study
a
structure-activity
relationship
(
SAR
)
built
on

,
which
expands
on
our
initial

The
biological

our
analogues
was
evaluated
in
models
of
bona

including
NFκB

transcription
as
a
marker
for
an
inflammatory

.

The

the
most
efficacious
inhibitors
(
6

)
was
in
the
low
nanomolar
range
in
these
two
cellular
assays
.

Our
study
demonstrates
the
key
structural
elements
that
confer
inhibitory
activity

highlights
the
requirement
for
electron-donating
moieties
off
the
C-4
aryl
moiety

These

has
potential
for
further
development
into

efficacy

and
pendrin
demonstrated
RhBG
immunoreactivity
in
all
CNT
cells
and
all
CCD
and
ICT
principal
cells
.

In
the
ICT
and
CCD
,
basolateral
RhBG
immunoreactivity
is
also
present
in
A-type
intercalated
cells
but
not
in
pendrin-positive
CCD
intercalated
cells
.

In
the
OMCD
and
IMCD
,
only
intercalated
cells
exhibit
RhBG
immunoreactivity
.

Immunoreactivity
for
a
second
putative
ammonium
transporter
,
RhCG
,
was
present
in
the
apical
region
of
cells
with
almost
the
same
distribution
as
RhBG
.

However
,
RhCG
immunoreactivity
was
present
in
all
CCD
cells
,
and
it
was
present
in
outer
stripe
OMCD
principal
cells
,
in
addition
to
OMCD
and
IMCD
intercalated
cells
.

Thus
the
majority
of
RhBG
and
RhCG
protein
expression
is
present
in
the
same
epithelial
cell
types
in
the
CNT
and
collecting
duct
but
with
opposite
polarity
.

These
findings
suggest
that
RhBG
and
RhCG
may
play
important
and
cell-specific
roles
in
ammonium
transport
and
signaling
in
these
regions
of
the
kidney

using

Flecainide
(

mM
)
caused
tonic
and
use-dependent
block
(
UDB
)
of
I
(
Na
)
in
a
concentration-dependent
manner
.

Compared
with
WT
,
DeltaKPQ
I
(
Na
)
was
more
sensitive
to
flecainide
,
and
flecainide
preferentially
inhibited
late

Na
)
(
mean
current
between
20
and
23

5
ms
after
depolarization
)
compared
with
peak
I
(
Na
)
.

The
IC
(
50
)
value
of
peak
and
late
I
(
Na
)
for
WT
was
127
+

and
44

(

and
for

and
19

/
-
2
microM
(
n

respectively
.

UDB
of
peak
I
(
Na
)
was
greater
and
developed
more
slowly
during
pulse
trains
for
DeltaKPQ
than
for
WT
.

The
IC
(
50
)
value
for
UDB
of
peak

(

)
for
WT
was
29

and
for
DeltaKPQ
was
11

microM
(
n

)
.

For
DeltaKPQ
,
UDB
of
late
I
(
Na
)
was
greater
than
for
peak
I
(
Na
)
.

Recovery
from
block
was
slower
for
DeltaKPQ
than
for
WT
.

We
conclude
that
DeltaKPQ
interacts
differently
with
flecainide
than
with
WT
,
leading
to
increased
block
and
slowed
recovery
,
especially
for
late
I
(
Na
)
.

These
data
provide
insights
into
mechanisms
for
flecainide
block
and
provide
a
rationale
at
the
cellular
and
molecular
level
that
open
channel
block
may
be
a
useful
pharmacological
property
for
treatment
of

Cys2-His2
zinc
finger
proteins
(
ZFPs
)
are
the
largest
group
of
transcription
factors
in
higher
metazoans
.

A
complete
characterization
of
these
ZFPs
and
their
associated
target
sequences
is
pivotal
to
fully
annotate
transcriptional
regulatory
networks
in
metazoan
genomes
.

As
a
first
step
in
this
process
,
we
have
characterized
the
DNA-binding
specificities
of
129
zinc
finger
sets
from
Drosophila
using
a
bacterial
one-hybrid
system
.

This
data
set
contains
the
DNA-binding
specificities
for
at
least
one
encoded
ZFP
from
70
unique
genes
and
23
alternate
splice
isoforms
representing
the
largest
set
of
characterized
ZFPs
from
any
organism
described
to
date
.

These
recognition
motifs
can
be
used
to
predict
genomic
binding
sites
for
these
factors
within
the
fruit
fly
genome
.

Subsets
of
fingers
from
these
ZFPs
were
characterized
to
define
their
orientation
and
register
on
their
recognition
sequences
,
thereby
allowing
us
to
define
the
recognition
diversity
within
this
finger
set
.

We
find
that
the
characterized
fingers
can
specify
47
of
the
64
possible
DNA
triplets
.

To
confirm
the
utility
of
our
finger
recognition
models
,
we
employed
subsets
of
Drosophila
fingers
in
combination
with
an
existing
archive
of
artificial
zinc
finger
modules
to
create
ZFPs
with
novel
DNA-binding
specificity
.

These
hybrids
of
natural
and
artificial
fingers
can
be
used
to
create
functional
zinc

Mechanisms
leading
to
down-regulation
of
activated
microglia
and
astrocytes
are
poorly
understood
,
in
spite
of
the
potentially
detrimental
role
of
activated
glia
in
neurodegeneration
.

Prostaglandins
,
produced
both
by
neurons
and
glia
,
may
serve
as
mediators
of
glial
and
neuronal
functions
.

We
examined
the
influence
of
cyclopentenone
prostaglandins
and
their
precursors
on
activated
glia
.

As
models
of
glial
activation
,
production
of
inducible
nitric-oxide
synthase
(
iNOS
)
was
studied
in
lipopolysaccharide-stimulated
rat
microglia
,
a
murine
microglial
cell
line
BV-2
,
and
IL-1beta-stimulated
rat
astrocytes
.

Cyclopentenone
prostaglandins
were
potent
inhibitors
of
iNOS
induction
and
were
more
effective
than
their
precursors
,
prostaglandins
E2
and
D2
.

15-Deoxy-Delta12
,
14-prostaglandin
J2
(
15d-PGJ2
)
was
the
most
potent
prostaglandin
among
those
tested
.

In
activated
microglia
,
15d-PGJ2
suppressed
iNOS
promoter
activity
,
iNOS
mRNA
,
and
protein
levels
.

The
action
of
15d-PGJ2
does
not
appear
to
involve
its
nuclear
receptor
peroxisome
proliferator-activated
receptor
gamma
(
PPARgamma
)
because
troglitazone
,
a
specific
ligand
of
PPARgamma
,
was
unable
to
inhibit
iNOS
induction
,
and
neither
troglitazone
nor
15d-PGJ2
could
stimulate
the
activity
of
a
PPAR-dependent
promoter
in
the
absence
of
cotransfected
PPARgamma
.

15d-PGJ2
did
not
block
nuclear
translocation
or
DNA-binding
activity
of
the
transcription
factor
NFkappaB
,
but
it
did
inhibit
the
activity
of
an
NFkappaB
reporter
construct
,
suggesting
that
the
mechanism
of
suppression
of
microglial
iNOS
by
15d-PGJ2
may
involve
interference
with
NFkappaB
transcriptional
activity
in
the
nucleus
.

Thus
,
our
data
suggest
the
existence
of
a
novel
pathway
mediated
by
cyclopentenone
prostaglandins
,
which
may
represent
part
of
a
feedback
mechanism
leading
to
the
cessation
of
inflammatory
glial
responses
in
the
brain
.

There
is
some
evidence
that
oxidized
derivatives
of
cholesterol
,
7-ketocholesterol
(
7KC
)
and
7β-hydroxycholesterol
(
7βOHC
)
,
are
increased
in
the
plasma
of
patients
with
neurodegenerative
diseases
associated
with
demyelinization
of
the
central
nervous
system
(
CNS
)
.

It
was
therefore
of
interest
to
investigate
the
effects
of
these
oxysterols
on
oligodendrocytes
,
the
myelin-forming
cells
in
the
CNS
.

To
this
end
,
158N
murine
oligodendrocytes
were
treated
with
7KC
or
7βOHC
inducing
an
apoptotic
mode
of
cell
death
characterized
by
condensation
/
fragmentation
of
the
nuclei
,
dephosphorylation
of
Akt
and
GSK3
,
mitochondrial
depolarization
involving
Mcl-1
,
and
caspase-3
activation
.

In
contrast
,
under
treatment
with
27-hydroxycholesterol
(
27OHC
)
,
no
cell
death
was
observed
.

When
the
cells
were
stained
with
Fura-2
,
no
significant
Ca
(
2
+
)
rise
was
found
with
the
different
oxysterols
,
whereas
strong
signals
were
detected
with
ionomycin
used
as
positive
control
.

At
concentrations
which
induced
apoptosis
,
7KC
but
not
7βOHC
accumulated
in
lipid
rafts
.

Although
not
cytotoxic
,
27OHC
was
mainly
detected
in
lipid
rafts
.

It
is
noteworthy
that
α-tocopherol
(
but
not
ellagic
acid
and
resveratrol
)
was
able
to
counteract
7KC-
and
7βOHC-induced
apoptosis
and
to
decrease
the
accumulation
of
7KC
and
27OHC
in
lipid
rafts
.

Thus
,
in
158N
cells
,
the
ability
of
oxysterols
to
trigger
a
mode
of
cell
death
by
apoptosis
involving
GSK-3
and
caspase-3
activation
is
independent
of
the
increase
in
the
Ca
(
2
+
)
level
and
of
their
accumulation
in
lipid
raft
microdomains
.

Severe
burn
injury
causes
hepatic
dysfunction
that
results
in
major
metabolic
derangements
including
insulin
resistance
and
hyperglycemia
and
is
associated
with
hepatic
endoplasmic
reticulum
(
ER
)
stress
.

We
have
recently
shown
that
insulin
reduces
ER
stress
and
improves
liver
function
and
morphology;
however
,
it
is
not
clear
whether
these
changes
are
directly
insulin
mediated
or
are
due
to
glucose
alterations
.

Metformin
is
an
antidiabetic
agent
that
decreases
hyperglycemia
by
different
pathways
than
insulin;
therefore
,
we
asked
whether
metformin
affects
postburn
ER
stress
and
hepatic
metabolism
.

The
aim
of
the
present
study
is
to
determine
the
effects
of
metformin
on
postburn
hepatic
ER
stress
and
metabolic
markers
.

Male
rats
were
randomized
to

metformin

were

at

Outcomes
measured
were

in

were
not
normalized
by
metformin
treatment
.

In
addition
,
ER

markers
were
similarly
increased
in
burn
injury
with
or
without
metformin
compared
with
sham
(
p

)
.

We
also
found
that
gluconeogenesis
and
fatty

metabolism
gene
expressions
were
upregulated
with
or
without
metformin
compared
with
sham
(
p
<

)
.

Our
results
indicate
that
,
whereas
thermal
injury
results
in
hepatic
ER
stress
,
metformin
does
not
ameliorate
postburn
stress
responses

We
evaluated
the
clinical
effectiveness
of
esmolol
,
an

blocking
drug
,
to
control
the
sinus

induced

(

Each
of

,
participated
in
a
double-blind
,
randomized
study
,
involving
four
match-pair
trials
(

)
during
ECT
.

Each
patient
acted
as
his
or
her
own
control
(
total
number
of
ECT
procedures
,
160
)
.

We
administered
a
4-min
infusion
of
either
placebo
or
esmolol
at
the
rate
of
500
micrograms
.

kg-1

.

We
then
induced
anesthesia
with
methohexital
and
succinylcholine
.

After
administration
of
electrical
stimulation
for
ECT
,
the
rate
of
infusion
decreased
to
300
micrograms
.

kg-1
.

min-1
for
three
additional
minutes
and
was
then
discontinued
.

Statistically
significant
reductions
in
mean
heart
rate
from
minute
2
until
minute
15
and
in
maximum
heart
rate
(
the
mean
of
each
patient's
maximum
heart
rate
after
seizure
changed
from
152
+
/

23
to
115

/
-
24
beats

min
)
occurred
in
patients
given
esmolol
.

During
and
immediately
after
infusion
,
arterial
blood
pressure
also
decreased
.

Finally
,
the
length
of
seizures
decreased
,
as
manifested
clinically
from
48
+
/

18
to
39

and
on
electroencephalogram
from
86
+

-
41
to

s
.

We
conclude
that
esmolol
effectively
controls
the
hyperdynamic
response
to
ECT
and
reduces
the
length
of
seizures
.

The
significance
of
the
latter
to
the
overall
effectiveness
of

Gemcitabine
and
pemetrexed
are
effective
agents
in
the
treatment
of
non-small-cell

,
and
the
present
study
investigates
cellular
and
genetic
aspects
of
their
interaction
against
A549
,
Calu-1
,
and
Calu-6
cells
.

Cells
were
treated
with
pemetrexed
and
gemcitabine
,
and
their
interaction
was
assessed
using
the
combination
index
.

The
role
of

metabolism
in
gemcitabine
cytotoxicity
was
examined
with
inhibitors
of
deoxycytidine
kinase
(

,

and

,
whereas
the

)
,
and

)
in
drug
chemosensitivity
was
analyzed
in

studies
.

The
effect
of
gemcitabine
and
pemetrexed
on
Akt
phosphorylation
was
investigated
with
enzyme-linked
immunosorbent
assay
,
whereas
quantitative
polymerase
chain
reaction
(
PCR
)
was
used
to
study
target
gene-expression
profiles
and
its
modulation
by
each
drug
.

Synergistic
cytotoxicity
was
demonstrated
,
and
pemetrexed
significantly
decreased
the
amount
of
phosphorylated
Akt
,
enhanced
apoptosis
,
and
increased
the
expression
of
dCK
in
A549
and
Calu-6
cells
,
as
well
as
the
expression
of
the
human
nucleoside
equilibrative
transporter

(
hENT1
)
in
all
cell
lines
.

PCR
demonstrated
a
correlation
between
dCK
expression
and
gemcitabine
sensitivity
,
whereas
expression
of
TS
,
DHFR
,
and
GARFT
was
predictive
of
pemetrexed
chemosensitivity
.

These
data
demonstrated
that
1
)
gemcitabine
and
pemetrexed
synergistically
interact
against
NSCLC
cells
through
the
suppression
of
Akt
phosphorylation
and

Progression
of
breast
cancer
from
an
estrogen-dependent
,
slowly
growing
tumor
amenable
to
tamoxifen
treatment
to
an
aggressive
,
metastatic
,
estrogen-independent
phenotype
has
been
mimicked
by
the
transfection
of
MCF-7
breast
carcinoma
cells
with
fibroblast
growth
factors
1
or
4
.

FGF-transfected
cells
are
aggressively
tumorigenic
in
ovariectomized
or
tamoxifen-treated
nude
mice
,
conditions
under
which
the
parental
cells
would
not
produce
tumors
.

When
detection
of
metastasis
was
enhanced
by
lacZ
transfection
,
the
FGF-transfected
MCF-7
cells
were
reliably
metastatic
to
lymph
nodes
and
frequently
metastatic
to
lungs
,
in
further
contrast
to
parental
cells
.

An
antiangiogenic
drug
,
AGM-1470
,
given
to
mice
bearing
tumors
produced
by
FGF-transfected
MCF-7
cells
,
produced
a
decrease
in
tumor
size
.

The
decreased
tumor
size
was
not
as
marked
as
that
produced
by
treatment
with
pentosan
polysulfate
,
an
agent
which
would
abrogate
all
autocrine
or
paracrine
effects
of
the
transfected
FGF
.

Thus
,
increased
angiogenesis
may
be
a
component
of
the
phenotypic
change
produced
by
the
FGF
transfection
,
but
other
autocrine
or
paracrine
effects
may
also
be
important
.

Since
a
clonal
FGF-4
and
lacZ
doubly-transfected
cell
line
,
MKL-4
,
progressively
lost
expression
of
the
transfected
lacZ
gene
in
individual
cells
,
we
performed
successive
rounds
of
fluorescence-activated
cell
sorting
to
select
high-expressing
cells
.

High-expressing
cell
populations
thus
obtained
rapidly
lost
expression
of
beta-gal
activity
in
continued
culture
.

High
beta-gal
expressing
clonal
cell
lines
of
MKL-4
cells
established
by
either
one
or
two
rounds
of
low-density
cloning
also
lost
lacZ
expression
with
continued
culture
.

Southern
analysis
of
DNA
from
lacZ
transfected
cell
lines
showed
the
transfected
sequences
to
be
present
and
grossly
intact
in
both
high
and
low
expressing
populations
.

However
,
Northern
analysis
revealed
that
high-expressing
populations
of
MKL-4
cells
contained
the
most
lacZ
mRNA
,
implying
that
in
the
unstable
MKL-4
cell
line
,
individual
cells
are
down-regulating
mRNA
levels
of
lacZ
.

Stable
lacZ
expression
has
been
obtained
in
other
FGF-transfected
and
parental
MCF-7
cell
lines
using
the
same
expression
vector
.

Thus
,
the
MKL-4
cell
line
is
down-regulating
mRNA
encoding
the
transfected
gene
through
a
mechanism
not
dependent
on
the
CMV
promotor
utilized
in
the
expression
vector
.

This
evidence
suggests
that
lacZ
expression
is
not
a
benign
modification
in
certain
cells
.
Postpartum
depression
(
PPD
)
affects
approximately
15%
of
mothers
after
giving
birth
.

A
complete
understanding
of
depression
during
the
postpartum
period
has
yet
to
be
established
,
although
disruptions
in
the
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
axis
and
stress
during
the
postpartum
may
be
involved
.

To
model
these
components
in
rats
,
we
administered
high
corticosterone
(
CORT
)
postpartum
,
which
increases
immobility
in
the
forced
swim
test
(
FST
)
,
and
reduces
maternal
care
,
body
weight
and
hippocampal
cell
proliferation
in
dams
.

The
hippocampus
is
altered
in
response
to
chronic
stress
,
exposure
to
high
glucocorticoids
and
in
major
depression
in
humans
.

In
the
present
study
,
we
examined
whether
high
CORT
reduced
dendritic
complexity
and
spines
in
the
CA3
region
of
the
hippocampus
.

Additionally
,
housing
complexity
was
manipulated
so
that
dams
and
litters
were
housed
either
with
tubes
(
complex
)
or
without
tubes
(
impoverished
)
to
investigate
the
consequences
of
new
animal
care
regulations
.

Dams
received
40
mg
/
kg
/
day
of
CORT
or
oil
starting
on
day
2
postpartum
for
23
days
.

Maternal
behaviours
were
assessed
on
postpartum
days
2-8
and
dams
were
tested
using
the
FST
on
days
21
and
22
.

Dams
were
killed
on
day
24
and
brains
were
processed
for
Golgi
impregnation
.

Pyramidal
cells
in
the
CA3
subfield
were
traced
using
a
camera
lucida
and
analysed
for
branch
points
and
dendritic
complexity
,
as
well
as
spine
density
and
type
on
both
basal
and
apical
arbours
.

As
previously
established
,
high
CORT
postpartum
reduced
maternal
care
and
increased
immobility
in
the
FST
,
which
is
a
measure
of
depressive-like
behaviour
.

High
CORT
postpartum
reduced
the
complexity
of
basal
arbours
and
increased
mushroom
spines
on
both
apical
and
basal
dendrites
.

Housing
complexity
had
no
effect
on
spines
of
CA3
pyramidal
cells
but
modest
effects
on
cell
morphology
.

These
data
show
that
chronic
high
CORT
in
postpartum
females
alters
hippocampal
morphology
and
may
provide
insight
regarding
the
neurobiological
consequences
of
high
stress
or
CORT
during
the
postpartum
period
,
as
well
as
be
relevant
for
postpartum
stress
or
depression
.

Rosuvastatin
,
a

statin
,
has
been
shown
to
possess
a
number
of
advantageous
pharmacological
properties
,
including
enhanced
HMG-CoA
reductase
binding
characteristics
,
relative
hydrophilicity
,
and
selective
uptake
into

activity
in
hepatic
cells
.

Cytochrome
p450
(
CYP
)
metabolism
of
rosuvastatin
appears
to
be
minimal
and
is
principally
mediated
by
the
2C9
enzyme
,
with
little
involvement
of
3A4;
this
finding
is
consistent
with
the
absence
of
clinically
significant
pharmacokinetic
drug-drug
interactions
between
rosuvastatin
and
other
drugs
known
to
inhibit
CYP
enzymes
.

Dose-ranging
studies
in
hypercholesterolemic
patients
demonstrated
dose-dependent
effects
in
reducing
low-density
lipoprotein
cholesterol
(
LDL-C
)
(
up
to
63%
)
,
total
cholesterol
,
and
apolipoprotein
(
apo
)
B
across
a
1-
to
40-mg
dose
range
and
a
significant
8
.
4%
additional
reduction
in
LDL-C
,
compared
with
atorvastatin
,
across
the
dose
ranges
of
the
two
agents
.

Rosuvastatin
has
also
been
shown
to
be
highly
effective
in
reducing
LDL-C
,
increasing
high-density
lipoprotein
cholesterol
(
HDL-C
)
,
and
producing
favorable
modifications
of
other
elements
of
the
atherogenic
lipid
profile
in
a
wide
range
of
dyslipidemic
patients
.

In
patients
with
mild
to
moderate
hypercholesterolemia
,
rosuvastatin
has
been
shown
to
produce
large
decreases
in
LDL-C
at
starting
doses
,
thus
reducing
the
need
for
subsequent
dose
titration
,
and
to
allow
greater
percentages
of
patients
to
attain
lipid
goals
,
compared
with
available
statins
.

The
substantial
LDL-C
reductions
and
improvements
in
other
lipid
measures
with
rosuvastatin
treatment
should
facilitate
achievement
of
lipid
goals
and
reduce
the
requirement
for
combination
therapy
in
patients
with
severe
hypercholesterolemia
.

In
addition
,
rosuvastatin's
effects
in
reducing
triglycerides
,
triglyceride-containing
lipoproteins
,
non-HDL-C
,
and
LDL-C
and
increasing
HDL-C
in
patients
with
mixed
dyslipidemia
or
elevated
triglycerides
should
be
of
considerable
value
in
enabling
achievement
of
LDL-C
and
non-HDL-C
goals
in
the
numerous
patients
with
combined
dyslipidemias
or
metabolic
syndrome
who
require
lipid-lowering
therapy
.

Rosuvastatin
is
well
tolerated
alone
,
and
in
combination
with
fenofibrate
,
extended-release
niacin
,
and
cholestyramine
,
and
has
a
safety
profile
similar
to
that
of
currently
marketed
statins
.

A
large
,
long-term
clinical
trials
program
is
under
way
to
investigate
the
effects
of
rosuvastatin
on

morbidity
and
mortality
.
A

of

(

)
carbon
materials
with
different
specific
surface
area
(

)
and
controlled
pore
size
distribution
(
PSD
)
were
synthesized
at
large
scale
through
a
facile
and
low-cost
method
.

The
SSA
and
PSD
of
these
carbon
materials
were
controlled
by
using
different
carbon
sources
and
preparation
methods
.

With
different
total
and
effective
SSA
(
E-SSA
)
and
PSD
,
the
impacts
on
their
capacitance
performance
were
investigated
thoroughly
,
which
demonstrated
that
both
E-SSA
and
PSD
played
the
most
important
roles
in
their
capacitance
performance
.

Furthermore
,
theoretical
modeling
was
performed
,
and
the
results
are
in
agreement
with
the
experimental
results
for
the
influence
of
E-SSA
and
PSD
on
their
capacitance
performance
.

Based
on
these
,
a
general
model
using
the
slit
/
cylindrical
NL-DFT
approach
is
proposed
for
the
estimation
of
the
specific
capacitance
of
sp

materials
,
which
offers
a
simple
but
reliable
method
to
predict
the
capacitance

To
gain
insights
into
their
mechanism
of
action
,
9-wk-old
male
apolipoprotein
E
(
apoE
)
-deficient
mice
were
fed
a
DPP-4
inhibitor
,
anagliptin-containing
diet
.

The
effects
of
anagliptin
were
investigated
in
,
a
monocyte
cell
line
,
human
THP-1
cells
,
and
rat
smooth
muscle
cells
(
SMCs
)
.

Treatment
with
anagliptin
for
16
wk
significantly
reduced
accumulation
of
monocytes
and
macrophages
in
the
vascular
wall
,
SMC
content
in
plaque
areas
,
and
oil
red
O-stained
area
around

aortic
valve
without
affecting
glucose
tolerance
or
body
weight
.

Serum
DPP-4
concentrations
were
significantly
higher
in
apoE-deficient
mice
than
control
mice
,
and
the
levels
increased
with
aging
,
suggesting
the
involvement
of
DPP-4
in
the
progression
of
atherosclerosis
.

Indeed
,
soluble
DPP-4
augmented
cultured
SMC
proliferation
,
and
anagliptin
suppressed
the
proliferation
by
inhibiting
ERK
phosphorylation
.

In
THP-1
cells
,
anagliptin
reduced
lipopolysaccharide-induced
TNF-α
production
with
inhibiting
ERK
phosphorylation
and
nuclear
translocation
of
nuclear
factor-κB
.

Quantitative
analysis
also
showed
that
anagliptin
reduced
the
area
of
atherosclerotic
lesion
in
apoE-deficient
mice
.

These
results
indicated
that
the
anti-atherosclerotic
effect
of
anagliptin
is
mediated
,
at
least
in
part
,
through
its
direct
inhibition
of
SMC
proliferation
and
inflammatory
reaction
of
monocytes
.

into
cells
.

We
discovered
an
unexpected
binding
between
Elmo1
and
the
Mediator
complex
subunit
Med31
.

The
Mediator
complex
is
a
regulatory
hub
for
nearly
all
gene
transcription
via
RNA
polymerase
II
,
bridging
the
general
transcription
machinery
with
gene-specific

is
the
smallest
and
the
most
evolutionarily
conserved
Mediator
subunit
,
and
knockout
of
Med31
results
in
embryonic
lethality
in
mice;
however
,
Med31
function
in
specific
biological
contexts
is
poorly
understood
.

We
observed
that
in
primary
macrophages
,
during
Salmonella
infection
,
Elmo1
and
Med31
specifically
affected
expression
of
the
cytokine
genes
Il10
and
Il33
among
the
>25
genes
monitored
.

Although
endogenous
Med31
is
predominantly
nuclear
localized
,
Elmo1
increased
the
cytoplasmic
localization
of
Med31
.

We
identify
ubiquitination
as
a
novel
posttranslational
modification
of
Med31
,
with
the
cytoplasmic
monoubiquitinated

RATIONALE
:
Past
research
on
the
association
of
antidepressant
medication
use
with
glycemic
control
abnormalities
has
produced
mixed
results
.

OBJECTIVE
:
To
examine
the
association
of
antidepressant
use
with
glycemic
control
abnormalities
and
screen-positive
diabetes
in
a
representative
population
sample
of
US
adults
without
a
diagnosis
of
diabetes
.

METHODS
:
Using
data
from
adult
participants
of
the
National
Health
and
Nutrition
Examination
Survey
(
NHANES
,
2005-2010
)
,
the
association
of
antidepressant
use
with
continuous
measures
of
HbA1c
,
fasting
blood
sugar
,
2-h
oral
glucose
tolerance
test
,
insulin
sensitivity
and
screen-positive
diabetes
according
to
HbA1c
,
fasting
blood
sugar
and
2-h
oral
glucose
tolerance
test
were
assessed
.

RESULTS
:
Antidepressant
use
was
not
associated
with
increased
levels
of
HbA1c
,
fasting
blood
sugar
,
2-h
oral
glucose
tolerance
test
,
reduced
insulin
sensitivity
or
increased
prevalence
of
screen-positive
diabetes
.

Results
were
mostly
consistent
across
sociodemographic
groups
and
across
different
lengths
of
exposure
,
different
classes
of
antidepressants
and
levels
of
body
mass
index
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
In
this
representative
population
sample
,
antidepressant
use
was
not
associated
with
an
increased
risk
of
abnormalities
in
glycemic
control
or
undetected
diabetes
.

Positive
findings
from
past
research
may
be
attributable
to
detection
bias
,
in
that
individuals
prescribed
antidepressants
may
be
more
likely
to
be
tested
and
diagnosed
with
diabetes
.

The

)
methylene
]
-3-
(
4-chlorobenzyl

-thiazolidine-2
,
4-dione
(
LYSO-7
)
was
synthesised
in
order
to
obtain
a
new
type
of
anti-inflammatory
drug
,
designed
with
hybrid
features
to
inhibit
cyclooxygenase
(
COX
)
and
also
to
activate
peroxisome
proliferator-activated
receptor
(
PPAR
)
.

Results
obtained
from
docking
(
in
silico
)
studies
corroborated
with
experimental
data
,
showing
the
potential
affinity
between
the
studied
ligand
and
targets
.

The
specificity
of
LYSO-7
for
COX-enzymes
was
detected
by
the
inhibition
of
COX-1
and
COX-2
activities
by
30%
and
20%
,
respectively
.

In
transactivation
reporter
gene
assays
LYSO-07
showed
a
pan
partial
agonist
effect
on
the
three
PPAR
subtypes
(
PPARγ
,
PPARα
and
PPARβ
/
δ
)
.

The
agonist
action
on
PPARγ
was
also
observed
by
a
pharmacological
approach
,
as
the
reduction
in
the
Escherichia
coli
lipopolysaccharide
(
LPS
)
-induced
interleukin
1
beta
(
IL-1β
)
secretion
and
nitric
oxide
(
NO
)
production
by
mouse
neutrophils
was
blocked
by
GW9962
,
a
specific
PPARγ
antagonist
.

Additionally
,
the
in
vivo
effect
was
measured
by
reduced
carrageenan-induced
neutrophil
influx
into
the
subcutaneous
tissue
of
mice
.

Taken
together
,
these
data
show
that
LYSO-7
displays
a
potent
in
vivo
anti-inflammatory
effect
during
the
innate
acute
response
,
which
is
dependent
on
its
associated
COX
inhibitory
activities
and
PPAR
activation
.
Thymidine
kinase-1
(
TK-1
)
and
thymidylate
synthase
(
TS
)
are
key
enzymes
for
salvage
and
de
novo
pyrimidine
synthesis
,
respectively
.

Numerous
studies
have
suggested
that
increased
TS
levels
are
associated
closely
with
resistance
to
fluoropyrimidine-based
chemotherapy
.

TAS-102
is
a
novel
drug
containing
trifluorothymidine
,
which
is
phosphorylated
by
TK-1
to
its
active
monophosphated
form
,
that
in
turn
can
inhibit
TS
.

TAS-102
has
been
shown
to
exhibit
antitumor
activity
in
fluoropyrimidine-resistant
human
cancer
cells
.

TAS-102
is
currently
undergoing
clinical
trials
for
use
in
gastrointestinal
cancers
.

In
the
present
study
,
we
used
immunohistochemistry
to
investigate
the
expression
of
TK-1
and
TS
in
various
types
of
cancer
.

TK-1
and
TS
expression
was
markedly
different
between
cancer
types
.

High
TK-1
expression
was
detected
prominently
in
gastrointestinal
adenocarcinomas
and
esophageal
and
uterine
squamous
cell
carcinomas
.

Gastrointestinal
adenocarcinomas
and
squamous
cell
uterine
carcinomas
were
often
accompanied
by
high
TS
expression
,
indicating
activation
of
pyrimidine
synthesis
through
both
the
salvage
and
de
novo
pathways
.

These
results
led
us
to
consider
that
TAS-102
may
also
be
effective
for
esophageal
and
uterine
squamous
cell
carcinomas
,
as
well
as
for
gastrointestinal
adenocarcinomas
,
even
in
fluoropyrimidine-resistant
cases
with
high
TS
expression
.

In
contrast
,
thyroid
papillary
carcinomas
,
lung
adenocarcinomas
,
hepatocellular
carcinomas
,
pancreatic
ductal
carcinomas
,
and
renal
cell
carcinomas
,
which
exhibit
low
TK-1
expression
,
may
be
resistant
to
TAS-102
.

In
non-small
cell
lung
cancers
,
high
TK-1
expression
was
demonstrated
in
squamous
cell
carcinomas
,
but
not
in
adenocarcinomas
.

This
result
suggests
that
TAS-102
efficacy
and
the
pyrimidine
synthetic
pathway
may
differ
depending
on
histological
type
.

Our
results
indicate
that
administration
of
TAS-102
could
be
selected
on
the
basis
of
the
immunohistochemical
evaluation
of
TK-1
and
TS
.
The
disturbances
of
the
cholesterol
synthesis
and
metabolism
described
in
Alzheimer's
disease
(
AD
)
may
be
both
a
consequence
of
the
neurodegenerative
process
and
a
contributor
to
the
pathogenesis
.

These
putative
relationships
and
their
underlying
mechanisms
are
not
well
understood
.

The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
evaluate
the
relationship
between
the
cerebral
and
extracerebral
cholesterol
synthesis
and
metabolism
,
and
the
AD
pathology
as
reflected
by
CSF
markers
in
humans
.

We
evaluated
the
relationships
between
the
plasma
and
the
cerebrospinal
fluid
(
CSF
)
concentrations
of
cholesterol
,
the
cholesterol
precursors
lanosterol
,
lathosterol
and
desmosterol
,
and
the
cholesterol
elimination
products
24S-hydroxycholesterol
and
27-hydroxycholesterol
,
and
the
CSF
markers
for
AD
pathology
Aβ1-42
and
p-tau181
in
86
subjects
with
normal
cognition
and
in
107
AD
patients
.

CSF
desmosterol
,
cholesterol
and
24S-hydroxycholesterol
in
the
AD
group
,
and
CSF
24S-hydroxycholesterol
in
the
control
group
correlated
with
the
p-tau181
levels
.

Neither
CSF
nor
plasma
concentrations
of
the
included
compounds
correlated
with
the
CSF
Aβ1-42
levels
.

In
multivariate
regression
tests
including
age
,
gender
,
albumin
ratio
,
number
of
the
APOEɛ4
alleles
,
and
diagnosis
,
p-tau181
levels
independently
predicted
the
CSF
desmosterol
,
cholesterol
and
24S-hydroxycholesterol
concentrations
.

The
associations
remained
significant
for
CSF
cholesterol
and
24S-hydroxycholesterol
when
analyses
were
separately
performed
in
the
AD
group
.

The
results
suggest
that
alterations
of
CNS
cholesterol
de
novo
genesis
and
metabolism
are
related
to
neurodegeneration
and
in
particular
to
the
cerebral
accumulation
of

,
it
has
been
reported
that
rofecoxib
,
a
cyclooxygenase-2

COX-2
)
inhibitor
,
reacts
with
the
aldehyde
group
of
allysine
in
elastin
to
give
a

adduct
,
thereby
preventing
the
formation
of
cross-linkages
in
the
elastin
and
causing
degradation
of
the

in
aortas
in

(

]
rofecoxib
demonstrated
that
most
of
the
radioactivity
is
covalently
bound
to
elastin
.

The
in
vitro
covalent
binding
was
inhibited
in
the
presence
of
beta-aminopropionitrile
,
D-penicillamine
,
and
hydralazine
,
which
suggested
that
the
aldehyde
group
of
allysine
in
human
elastin
was
relevant
to
the
covalent
binding
.

The
in

covalent
binding
of
[
(

C
]
rofecoxib
was
significantly
decreased
by
the
addition
of
only
nonradiolabeled
rofecoxib

not
the
other
COX-2
inhibitors

celecoxib

.

All
the
above
COX-2
inhibitors
except
for
rofecoxib
had
no
reactivity
with
the
aldehyde
group
of
benzaldehyde
used
as
a
model
compound
of
allysine
aldehyde
under
a
physiological
pH
condition
.

On
the
other
hand
,
no
retention
of
the
radioactivity
of
[
(
14
)
C
]
rofecoxib
was
observed
in
human
aortic
endothelial
cells
in
vitro
,
suggesting
that
rofecoxib
is
not
retained
in
aortic
endothelial
cells
in
vivo
.

These
results
suggest
that
rofecoxib
,
but
not
other
COX-2
inhibitors
,
is
capable
of
covalently
binding
to
the
aldehyde
group
of
allysine
in
human
elastin
.

This
might
be
one
of
the
main
causes
of
cardiovascular
events
by
rofecoxib
in
clinical
situations
.
Agonists

of
choice
for
rescue
from
acute
bronchoconstriction
in
patients
with
both

disease
(

.

Moreover
,
the
use
of
long-acting
β-agonists
combined
with
inhaled
corticosteroids
constitutes
an
important
maintenance
therapy
for
these
diseases
.

β-Agonists
are
effective
bronchodilators
due
primarily
to
their
ability
to
antagonize
ASM
contraction
.

The
presumed
cellular
mechanism
of
action
involves
the
generation
of
intracellular
cAMP
,
which
in
turn
can
activate
the
effector
molecules
cAMP-dependent
protein
kinase
(
PKA
)
and

Other
agents
such
as
prostaglandin
E
(

)
and
phosphodiesterase
inhibitors
that
also
increase
intracellular
cAMP
levels
in
ASM
,
can
also
antagonize
ASM
contraction
,
and
inhibit
other
ASM
functions
including
proliferation
and
migration
.

Therefore
,
β
(
2
)
ARs
and
cAMP
are
key
players
in
combating
the
pathophysiology
of
airway
narrowing
and
remodeling
.

However
,

of
β-agonist
therapy

In

,
which

receptors
could
be
identified
with

which
recognizes
an
epitope

site
,
indicating
that
photosensitization
induced
a
structural
alteration
rather
than
loss
of
the
receptor
molecule
from
the
cell
surface
.

The
effect
of
DHE
and
light
appeared
to
be
highly
specific
,
since
binding
of
monoclonal
antibodies
to
other
surface
structures
was
not
decreased
.

DHE
plus
light-induced
modulation
of
Fc
gamma

was
found
to
be
mediated
by

,
since
addition

restored
both

in
the
effects
of

In

on
both

papillary
muscle
preparations
,
isoprenaline
and

caused
positive
inotropic
effects
via
beta-1
and

adrenoceptor
stimulation
.

In
the
atria
both
beta-1

increased
contractile
force
to
a
maximum;
in
left
papillary

,
however
,
only
beta-1
adrenoceptor

maximally
increased
contractile

,
whereas

caused
only

,
caused
a

It
is
concluded
that
in
humans
under
normal
physiologic
conditions
contractility
and

or
heart
rate
is
regulated
only
by
cardiac
beta-1
adrenoceptors
.

In
situations
of

,
however
,
when
large
amounts
of
adrenaline
are
released
from
the
adrenal
medulla
,
stimulation
of
cardiac

could
contribute
to
additional
increases
in

.
AIMS
/
HYPOTHESIS
:
We
examined
the
effects
of
serum
insulin
levels
on
vagal
control
over
the
heart
and
tested
the
hypothesis
that
higher
fasting
insulin
levels
are
associated
with
lower
vagal
control
.

We
also
examined
whether
experimentally
induced
increases
in
insulin
by
beta
cell
secretagogues
,
including
glucagon-like
peptide-1
(
GLP-1
)
,
will
decrease
vagal
control
.

METHODS
:
Respiration
and
ECGs
were
recorded
for
130
healthy
participants
undergoing
clamps
.

Three
variables
of
cardiac
vagal
effects
(
the
root
mean
square
of
successive
differences
[
rMSSD
]
in
the
interbeat
interval
of
the
heart
rate
[
IBI
]
,
heart-rate
variability
[
HRV
]
caused
by
peak-valley
respiratory
sinus
arrhythmia
[
pvRSA
]
,
and
high-frequency
power
[
HF
]
)
and
heart
rate
(
HR
)
were
obtained
at
seven
time
points
during
the
clamps
,
characterised
by
increasing
levels
of
insulin
(
achieved
by
administering
insulin
plus
glucose
,
glucose
only
,
glucose
and
GLP-1
,
and
glucose
and
GLP-1
combined
with
arginine
)
.

RESULTS
:
Serum
insulin
level
was
positively
associated
with
HR
at
all
time
points
during
the
clamps
except
the
first-phase
hyperglycaemic
clamp
.

Insulin
levels
were
negatively
correlated
with
variables
of
vagal
control
,
reaching
significance
for
rMSSD
and
log
(
10
)
HF
,
but
not
for
pvRSA
,
during
the
last
four
phases
of
the
hyperglycaemic
clamp
(
hyperglycaemic
second
phase
,
GLP-1
first
and
second
phases
,
and
arginine
)
.

These
associations
disappeared
when
adjusted
for
age
,
BMI
and
insulin
sensitivity
.

Administration
of
the
beta
cell
secretagogues
GLP-1
and
arginine
led
to
a
significant
increase
in
HR
,
but
this
was
not
paired
with
a
significant
reduction
in
HRV
measures
.

CONCLUSION
/
INTERPRETATION
:
Experimentally
induced
hyperinsulinaemia
is
not
correlated
with
cardiac
vagal
control
or
HR
when
adjusting
for
age
,
BMI
and
insulin
sensitivity
index
.

Our
findings
suggest
that
exposure
to
a
GLP-1
during
hyperglycaemia
leads
to
a
small
acute
increase
in
HR
but
not
to
an
acute
decrease
in
cardiac
vagal
control
.

,
which
was
consistent
with
their

and
NMR

indicated
that
the
site
of
attachment
of
the
glutathionyl
moiety
in
the
thiol
conjugates
was
on
the
thiazole

were
discerned
with
the

,
the

In
the
case
of

PURPOSE
:
Testosterone-to-estradiol
ratio
levels
in
infertile
men
improve
during
treatment
with
the
aromatase

on
the
hormonal

MATERIALS
AND
METHODS
:
A

Changes
in

was
studied
.

RESULTS
:
Men
treated
with
testolactone
had
an

This

was
noted
for
all

those
patients
with
the
Klinefelter

.

A
total
of
25
oligospermic
men
with

before
and
during

had
an

.

These
changes
were
similar
to
those
observed
in
men
treated
with
testolactone
.

No
significant
difference
in
serum
testosterone
levels
during
treatment
with
testolactone
and
anastrozole
was
observed
.

However
,
the
anastrozole
treatment
group
did
have
a
statistically
better
improvement
of
serum
estradiol
concentration
and
testosterone-to-estradiol
ratios
(
p

)
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
Men
who
are
infertile
with
a
low
serum
testosterone-to-estradiol
ratio
can
be
treated
with
an
aromatase
inhibitor
.

With
treatment
,
an
increase
in
testosterone-to-estradiol
ratio
occurred
in
association
with
increased
semen
parameters
.

Anastrozole
and
testolactone
have
similar
effects
on
hormonal
profiles
and
semen
analysis
.

Anastrazole
appears
to
be
at
least
as
effective
as
testolactone
for
treating
men
with
abnormal
testosterone-to-estradiol
ratios
,
except
for
the
subset
with
the
Klinefelter
syndrome
,
who
appeared
to
be
more
effectively
treated
with
testolactone

Nitric
oxide
(
NO
)
produced
by
the
endothelial
NO
synthase
(
eNOS
)
is
an
antihypertensive
,
antithrombotic
and
anti-atherosclerotic
molecule
.

Hypercholesterolemia
leads
to
a
reduction
in
vascular
NO
bioavailability
.

This
is
attributed
to
a
dysfunction
of
the
eNOS
enzyme
and
a
reduced
eNOS
activity
.

NADPH
oxidase-mediated
oxidative
stress
leads
to
oxidation
of
tetrahydrobiopterin
(
BH4
)
,
the
essential
cofactor
of
eNOS
.

In
BH4
deficiency
,
oxygen
reduction
uncouples
from
NO
synthesis
,
thereby
converting
eNOS
to
a
superoxide-producing
enzyme
.

As
a
consequence
of
eNOS
uncoupling
,
NO
production
is
reduced
and
the
pre-existing
oxidative
stress
is
enhanced
,
which
contribute
significantly
to
atherogenesis
.

Therefore
,
pharmacological
approaches
that
prevent
eNOS
uncoupling
and
enhance
eNOS
activity
are
of
therapeutic
interest
.

Angiotensin-converting
enzyme
inhibitors
,
AT1
receptor
blockers
,
statins
,
nebivolol
and
resveratrol
have
been
shown
to
reverse
eNOS
uncoupling
and
to
stimulate
eNOS
activity
concurrently
.

Molecular
mechanisms
of
the
aforementioned
drugs
/
compounds
on
eNOS
functionality
is
summarized
and
discussed
in
this

Brain
slice
recordings
indicate
that
GluR5
kainate
receptors
mediate
a
portion
of
the
synaptic
excitation
of
neurons
in
the
rat
basolateral
amygdala
.

Whole-cell
voltage-clamp
studies
demonstrate
that
GluR5
kainate
receptor-mediated
synaptic
currents
are
inwardly
rectifying
and
are
likely
to
be
calcium
permeable
.

Prolonged
activation
of
basolateral
amygdala
GluR5
kainate
receptors
results
in
enduring
synaptic
facilitation
through
a
calcium-dependent
process
.

The
selective
GluR5
kainate
receptor
agonist
ATPA
induces
spontaneous
epileptiform
bursting
that
is
sensitive
to
the
GluR5
kainate
receptor
antagonist
LY293558
.

Intra-amygdala
infusion
of
ATPA
in
the
rat
induces
limbic
status
epilepticus;
in
some
animals
,
recurrent
spontaneous
seizures
occur
for
months
after
the
ATPA
treatment
.

Together
,
these
observations
indicate
that
GluR5
kainate
receptors
have
a
unique
role
in
triggering
epileptiform
activity
in
the
amygdala
and
could
participate
in
long-term
plasticity
mechanisms
that
underlie
some
forms
of
epileptogenesis
.

Accordingly
,
GluR5
kainate
receptors
represent
a
potential
target
for
antiepileptic
and
antiepileptogenic
drug
treatments
.

Most
antiepileptic
drugs
do
not
act
through
effects
on
glutamate
receptors
.

However
,
topiramate
at
low
concentrations
causes
slow
inhibition
of
GluR5
kainate
receptor-mediated
synaptic
currents
in
the
basolateral
amygdala
,
indicating
that
it
may
protect
against
seizures
,
at
least
in
part
,
through
suppression
of
GluR5

remarkably

With

The
antidiabetic
drug
Metformin
causes
weight

in
both

non-diabetic
individuals
.

Metformin
treatment
is
also
associated
with
lower
circulating
levels
of
the
orexigenic
hormone
ghrelin
.

To
test
whether
Metformin
directly
affects
ghrelin
cells
,
rat
primary
stomach
cells
were
treated
with
Metformin
and
the
levels
of
ghrelin
secretion
,
proghrelin
gene
expression
and
activation
of
adenosine
monophosphate-activated
protein
kinase
(
AMPK
)
were
examined
.

Metformin
significantly
reduced
ghrelin
secretion
and
proghrelin
mRNA
production
and
both
these
effects
were
blocked
by
co-incubation
with
the
AMPK
inhibitor
compound
C
.

Furthermore
,
the
AMPK
activator
5-amino-1-β-D-ribofuranosyl-imidazole-4-carboxamide
(
AICAR
)
significantly
inhibited
ghrelin
secretion
.

Additionally
,
ghrelin
cells
were
shown
to
express
AMPK
.

Finally
,
Metformin
treatment
caused
a
significant
increase
in
the
level
of
phosphorylated
(
active
)
AMPK
.

Our
results
show
that
Metformin
directly
inhibits
stomach
ghrelin
production
and
secretion
through
AMPK
.

This
reduction
in
ghrelin
secretion
may
be
one
of
the
key
components

Excessive
manganese
(
Mn
)
uptake
by
brain
cells
,
particularly
in
regions
like
the
basal
ganglia
,
can
lead
to
toxicity
.

Mn
(
2

)
is
transported
into
cells
via
a
number
of
mechanisms
,
while
Mn
(
3
+
)
is
believed
to
be
transported
similarly
to
iron
(
Fe
)
via
the
transferrin
(
Tf
)
mechanism
.

Cellular
Mn
uptake
is
therefore
determined
by
the
activity
of
the
mechanisms
transporting
Mn
into
each
type
of
cell
and
by
the
amounts
of
Mn
(
2
+
)
,
Mn
(
3

)
and
their
complexes
to
which
these
cells
are
exposed;
this
complicates
understanding
the
contributions
of
each
transporter
to
Mn
toxicity
.

While
uptake
of
Fe
(
3
+
)
via
the
Tf
mechanism
is
well
understood
,
uptake
of
Mn
(
3
+
)
via
this
mechanism
has
not
been
systematically
studied
.

The
stability
of
the
Mn
(
3
+
)
Tf
complex
allowed
us
to
form
and
purify
this
complex
and
label
it
with
a
fluorescent
(
Alexa
green
)
tag
.

Using
purified
and
labeled
Mn
(
3
+
)
Tf
and
biophysical
tools
,
we
have
developed
a
novel
approach
to
study
Mn
(
3
+
)
Tf
transport
independently
of
other
Mn
transport
mechanisms
.

This
approach
was
used
to
compare
the
uptake
of
Mn
(
3
+
)
Tf
into
neuronal
cell
lines
with
published
descriptions
of
Fe
(
3
+
)
uptake
via
the
Tf
mechanism
,
and
to
obtain
quantitative
information
on
Mn
uptake
via
the
Tf
mechanism
.

Results
confirm
that
in
these
cell
lines
significant
Mn
(
3
+
)
is
transported
by
the
Tf
mechanism
similarly
to
Fe
(
3
+
)
Tf
transport;
although
Mn
(
3
+
)
Tf
transport
is
markedly
slower
than
other
Mn
transport
mechanisms
.

This
novel
approach
may
prove
useful
for
studying
Mn
toxicity
in
other
systems
and
cell
types

recognized
in

high

also
impart
diabetes
risk
.

Iron
plays
a
direct
and
causal
role
in
diabetes
pathogenesis
mediated
both
by
β
cell
failure
and
insulin
resistance
.

Iron
also
regulates
metabolism
in
most
tissues
involved
in
fuel
homeostasis
,
with
the
adipocyte
in
particular
serving
an
iron-sensing
role
.

The
underlying
molecular
mechanisms
mediating
these
effects

incompletely
understood

include
oxidant
stress
and
modulation
of
adipokines

induces
NF-κB

the
existence
of
synthetically

fully
able
to
report
the
presence
of
these
events
and
targets
in
a
rapid
and
highly
selective
and

fashion
.

Delineated
here
are
the
design
and
evaluation
of
a
newly
synthesized
turn-on
probe
whose
intense
fluorescent
reporter
signature
is
revealed
only
through
probe
activation
by
a
specific
intracellular
enzyme
present
in
tumor
cells
of
multiple
origins
.

Quenching
of
molecular
probe
fluorescence
is
achieved
through
unique
photoinduced
electron
transfer
between
the
naphthalimide
dye
reporter
and
a
covalently
attached
,
quinone-based
enzyme
substrate
.

Fluorescence
of
the
reporter
dye
is
turned
on
by
rapid
removal
of
the
quinone
quencher
,
an
event
that
immediately
occurs
only
after
highly
selective
,
two-electron
reduction
of
the
sterically
and
conformationally
restricted
quinone
substrate

,
and

.

The
potential
for
use
of
the
turn-on
probe
in
longer-term
cellular
studies
is
indicated
by
its
lack
of
influence
on

and
its

Endometriosis
is
defined
as
the
presence
of
endometrial
glands
and
stroma
outside
the
uterine
cavity
.

This
disease
is
associated
with
diminished
protective
effects
of
progesterone
,
which
are
usually
explained
by
inadequate
activation
of
progesterone
receptors
and
also
enhanced
pre-receptor
metabolism
of
progesterone
.

Endometriosis
is
often
treated
with
progestins
,
which
act
as
progesterone
receptor
agonists
,
although
their
exact
mechanisms
of
action
are
not
completely
understood
.

The
aim
of
the
present
study
was
to
investigate
how
the
progestins
medroxyprogesterone
acetate
,
dydrogesterone
and
dienogest
,
as
well
as
progesterone
,
impact
on
the
expression
of
genes
of
pre-receptor
progesterone
metabolism
in
Z-12
epithelial
cell
line
,
a
model
system
of
peritoneal
endometriosis
.

Our
data
demonstrate
that
these
progestins
affect
local
pre-receptor
metabolism
to
a
different
extent
.

The
most
favorable
effects
were
seen
for
dydrogesterone
and
dienogest
,
where
the
first
,
dydrogesterone
,
significantly
reduced
SRD5A1
,
AKR1C2
and
AKR1C3
expression
,
and
additionally
had
a
nonsignificant
impact
on
progesterone
receptor
B
(
PR-B
)
protein
levels
.

This
might
slow
down
the
first
step
of
pre-receptor
metabolism
,
the
conversion
of
progesterone
to
5α-dihydroprogestrone
by
SRD5A1
,
and
it
might
also
affect
further
reduction
of
3-keto
and
20-keto
groups
catalyzed
by
AKR1C2
and
AKR1C3
.

Similarly
favorable
effects
were
seen
for
dienogest
,
which
promoted
significant
reduction
of
AKR1C1
and
AKR1C2
expression
and
also
showed
no
effect
on
PR-B
protein
levels
.

Different
effects
were
seen
for
progesterone
,
which
significantly
decreased
SRD5A1
,
PR-B
and
HSD17B2
protein
levels
.

In
contrast
,
treatment
with
medroxyprogesterone
acetate
resulted
in
increased
AKR1C1
expression
and
decreased
levels
of
PR-B
,
which
might
lead
to
enhanced
progesterone
metabolism
and
reduced
signaling
through
progesterone
receptors
.

Altogether
,
our
data
in
this
Z-12
cell
model
suggest
that
the
beneficial
effects
of
treatment
with
progestin
observed
in
endometriosis
patients
might
arise
from
decreased
pre-receptor
metabolism
of
the
protective
progesterone
by
the
SRD5A1
and
AKR1C
enzymes
.

Lysophosphatidic
acid
(
LPA
)
,
the
simplest
of
the
water-soluble
phospholipids
,
can
evoke
various
biological
responses
.

The
present
study
examined
the
activity
of
LPA
to
induce
plasma
exudation
and
histamine
release
in
mice
.

Plasma
exudation
was
assessed
by
extravasation
of
Evans
blue
.

Subcutaneous
administration
of
LPA
(
1
-
100
microg
/
site
)
led
to
increased
plasma
exudation
in
the
skin
.

The
LPA-induced
plasma
exudation
was
inhibited
by
ketotifen
,
a
histamine
H1-receptor
antagonist
,
and
diacylglycerol
pyrophosphate
(
DGPP
)
,
a
LPA1
/
LPA3-receptor
antagonist
.

Moreover
,
pretreatment
with
pertussis
toxin
and
DGPP
inhibited
the
histamine
release
from
peritoneal
mast
cells
induced
by
LPA
.

These
findings
indicate
that
plasma
exudation
induced
by
LPA
is
mediated
by
histamine
release
from
mast
cells
via
LPA
receptor
(
s
)
,
presumably
LPA1
and
/
or
LPA3
,
coupled
to
G
(
i
/
o
)
proteins
.

Moreover
,
these
findings
point
to
a
role
of
LPA
in
the
pathomechanisms
of
various
allergic
disorders
.
Progressive
cardiac
remodeling
is
characterized
by
subsequent
chamber
hypertrophy
,
enlargement
,
and
pump
dysfunction
.

It
is
also
associated
with
increased
cardiac
fibrosis
and
matrix
turnover
.

Interestingly
,
peroxisome
proliferator-activated

(
PPAR
)
alpha

reduce
cardiac
hypertrophy
,
inflammation
,
and
fibrosis
.

Little
is
known
about
the
role
of
fenofibrates
in
mediating
PPARalpha-independent
effects
in
response
to
chronic
pressure
overload
(
PO
)
.

Wild-type
and
PPARalpha-deficient
mice
were
subjected
to
chronic
PO
caused
by
ascending
aortic
constriction
to
test
the
role
of
fenofibrates
in
chronic
,
progressive
cardiac
remodeling
by
a
PPARalpha-independent
mechanism
.

Mice
were
randomized
to
regular
chow
or
chow-containing
fenofibrate
(
100
mg
/
kg
of
body
weight
per
day
)
for
1
week
before
and
8
weeks
after
ascending
aortic
constriction
.

In
the
presence
of
PPARalpha
,
wild-type
chronic
PO
mice
,
treated
with
fenofibrate
,
had
improved
cardiac
remodeling
.

However
,
PO
PPARalpha-deficient
mice
treated
with
fenofibrate
had
increased

,
and

(

)
.

Fenofibrate
also
increased
myocardial
hypertrophy
,
cardiac
fibrosis
,
and
the
ratio
of
matrix
metalloproteinase-2
/
tissue
inhibitor
of
matrix
metalloproteinase-2
in
PO
PPARalpha-deficient
mice
.

Fenofibrate
inhibited
matrix
metalloproteinase
activity
in
vitro
and
aldosterone-induced
increases
in
extracellular
signal-regulated
kinase
phosphorylation
.

Thus
,
fenofibrate
improved
cardiac
remodeling
in
chronic
PO
mice
.

However
,
in
PPARalpha-deficient
mice
,
this
chronic
PO
was
exacerbated
and
associated
with
increased
myocardial
fibrosis
and
altered
matrix
remodeling
.

In
the
absence
of
PPARalpha
,

actions
.

This
is
an
important
observation
,
because
PPARalpha
agonists
are
considered
possible
inhibitory
regulators
of
cardiac
remodeling
in
the
remodeled
heart
.
Recent
proteomic
analyses
of
snake
venoms
show
that
metalloproteinases
represent
major

venoms
.

In
this
chapter
we
discuss
the
multiple
activities
of
the
SVMPs
.

In
addition
to
hemorrhagic
activity
,
members
of
the
SVMP
family
also
have
fibrin
(
ogen
)
olytic
activity
,
act
as
prothrombin
activators
,
activate
blood
coagulation
factor
X
,
possess
apoptotic
activity
,
inhibit
platelet
aggregation
,
are
pro-inflammatory
and
inactivate
blood
serine
proteinase
inhibitors
.

Clearly
the
SVMPs
have
multiple
functions
in
addition
to
their
well-known
hemorrhagic
activity
.

The
realization
that
there
are
structural
variations
in
the
SVMPs
and
the
early
studies
that
led
to
their
classification
represents
an
important
event
in
our
understanding
of
the
structural
forms
of
the
SVMPs
.

The
SVMPs
were
subdivided
into
the
P-I
,
P-II
and
P-III
protein
classes
.

The
noticeable
characteristic
that
distinguished
the
different
classes
was
their
size
(
molecular
weight
)
differences
and
domain
structure
:
Class
I
(
P-I
)
,
the
small
SVMPs
,
have
molecular
masses
of
20-30
kDa
,
contain
only
a
pro
domain
and
the
proteinase
domain;
Class
II
(
P-II
)
,
the
medium
size
SVMPs
,
molecular
masses
of
30-60
kDa
,
contain
the
pro
domain
,
proteinase
domain
and
disintegrin
domain;
Class
III
(
P-III
)
,
the
large
SVMPs
,
have
molecular
masses
of
60-100
kDa
,
contain
pro
,
proteinase
,
disintegrin-like
and
cysteine-rich
domain
structure
.

Another
significant
advance
in
the
SVMP
field
was
the
characterization
of
the
crystal
structure
of
the
first
P-I
class
SVMP
.

The
structures
of
other
P-I
SVMPs
soon
followed
and
the
structures
of
P-III
SVMPs
have
also
been
determined
.

The
active
site
of
the
metalloproteinase
domain
has
a
consensus
HEXXHXXGXXHD
sequence
and
a
Met-turn
.

The
"Met-turn"
structure
contains
a
conserved
Met
residue
that
forms
a
hydrophobic
basement
for
the
three
zinc-binding
histidines
in
the
consensus
sequence
.
This
study
examines
the
evolution
of
size
differences
among
papionin
primates
by
measuring
hormones
that
regulate
size
growth
during
ontogeny
and
influence
ultimate
adult
size
(
insulin-like
growth
factor-I
(
IGF-I
)
,
insulin-like
growth
factor
binding
protein-3
(
IGFBP-3
)
,
growth
hormone
binding
protein
(
GHBP
)
,
dehydroepiandrosterone
sulfate
(
DHEAS
)
,
testosterone
,
estradiol
)
.

The
analyses
assess
longstanding
ideas
about
circulating
hormone
levels
and
body
size
.

Importantly
,
because
the
consensus
papionin
molecular
phylogeny
implies
at
least
two
episodes
of
size
increase
,
this
study
offers
opportunities
to
determine
whether
or
not
similar
hormone
profiles
regulate
this
apparent
evolutionary
convergence
(
i
.

e
.

,
do
larger-bodied
papionins
have
higher
levels
of
growth-related
hormones
than
smaller-bodied
papionins?
)
.

Five
hundred
and
sixty
serum
samples
(
from
161
individuals
)
from
11
papionin
species
were
analyzed
using
a
two-level
approach
to
address
this
issue
.

One
used
mixed
longitudinal
samples
from
two
papionin
species
to
test
whether
,
during
growth
,
large-
and
small-bodied
species
have
higher
and
lower
hormone
levels
,
respectively
.

The
second
compared
multiple
papionin
species
to
assess
whether
or
not
hormone
levels
covary
with
size
in
adult
animals
.

Result
show
that
size
and
hormone
levels
do
not
covary
consistently
across
papionins
,
either
during
growth
or
in
adulthood
.

Specifically
,
some
smaller-bodied
papionin
species
have
higher
absolute
hormone
levels
than
larger-bodied
species
.

Differences
in
some
hormone
levels
appear
to
track
phylogeny
more
closely
than
body
size
.

In
contrast
to
studies
based
on
single
species
,
we
demonstrate
that
,
while
the
hormones
analyzed
affect
growth
,
absolute
circulating
hormone
levels
either
during
growth
or
adulthood
may
be
decoupled
from
interspecific
differences
in
body
size
.
The
aim
of
this

was
to
investigate
the

anti-glucosidase
and
anti-amylase

(

from

8-64mg

range
,
α-glucosidase
and

were
inhibited
by
TFs
to
a
certain
extent
.

In

,
the
treatment
groups
with
TFs
(
100
,
200
,
400mg

)
showed
a
significant
decrease
in
the
malondialdehyde
level
,
the
superoxide
dismutase
and
glutathione
levels
were
restored
to
almost
normal
levels
,
and
the
catalase
and
glutathione
peroxidase
levels
significantly
increased
compared
to
the
CCl4-intoxicated
group
in
rats
.

The
present
study
suggests
that
C

glandulosum
seeds
should
be
given
special
attention
because
of
their
antioxidant
and
anti-glucosidase
,
anti-amylase
activity
.
Amylin
is
a
peptide
hormone
which
is
co-secreted
with
insulin
from
the
pancreatic
beta-cell
.

Type
1
diabetic
individuals
and
some
Type
2
diabetic
individuals
are
characterised
by
amylin
deficiency
.

Animal
experiments
have
revealed
several
actions
of
amylin
on
intermediary
metabolism
,
of
these
some
have
been
demonstrated
to
be
of
potential
physiological
relevance
in
humans
.

In
particular
amylin
appears
to
have
important
actions
in
controlling
prandial
glucose
homeostasis
.

The
peptide
hormone
inhibits
postprandial
glucagon
secretion
and
delays
gastric
emptying
thereby
modifying
postprandial
hyperglycaemia
in
diabetic
individuals
which
presumably
adds
to
overall
glycaemic
control
without
a
concomitant
increase
in
the
number
of
severe
hypoglycaemic
episodes
.

Moreover
,
amylin
acts
as
a
satiety
agent
.

Amylin
replacement
may
therefore
improve
glycaemic
control
in
diabetes
mellitus
.

However
,
human
amylin
exhibits
physicochemical
properties
predisposing
the
peptide
hormone
to
aggregate
and
form
amyloid
fibres
,
which
makes
it
unsuitable
for
pharmacological
use
.

A
stable
analogue
,
pramlintide
,
with
actions
and
pharmacokinetic
and
pharmacodynamic
properties
similar
to
the
native
peptide
has
therefore
been
developed
.

The
efficacy
and
safety
of
pramlintide
administration
to
diabetic
individuals
have
been
tested
in
a
large
number
of
clinical
trials
.

It
is
the
aim
of
this
review
to
describe
possible
(
patho
)
physiological
actions
of
amylin
as
demonstrated
in
animal
and
human
models
,
to
discuss
the
background
for
potential
amylin
(
analogue
)
replacement
in
diabetes
mellitus
and
to
review
results
from
clinical
trials
with
the
amylin
receptor
analogue
pramlintide
.

The

treated
with
metformin
.

Whether
there
are
ethnicity-related
dietary
changes
or
differences
in
metformin
response
that
alter
the
relationship
between
glucose
control
and
triglycerides
requires
further
study
.
Some
17
alpha-alkylated
androgens
used
as
anabolic
agents
,
such
as
stanozolol
(
ST
)
and
danazol
(
DA
)
,
have
specific
effects
on
the
liver
that
are
not
exerted
by
testosterone
.

This
gives
rise
to
the
possibility
that
a
steroid-binding
protein
,
other
than
the
androgen
receptor
,
could
modulate
the
intracellular
actions
of
these
agents
.

Male
rat
liver
microsomes
contain
a
homogeneous
population
of
[
3H
]
dexamethasone
(
[
3H
]
DEX
)
-binding
sites
which
we
have
denominated
low
affinity
glucocorticoid-binding
sites
(
LAGS
)
.

Because
glucocorticoids
,
progestagens
,
and
the
synthetic
estrogen
ethynyl
estradiol
compete
with
[
3H
]
DEX
for
binding
to
the
LAGS
,
we
aimed
to
study
the
possible
interactions
between
androgens
and
the
LAGS
.

To
investigate
whether
several
androgens
had
the
capability
of
interacting
with
the
LAGS
,
we
performed
competition
experiments
.

The
LAGS
had
no
affinity
for
testosterone
or
methyltrienolone
(
R1881
)
.

However
,
some
17
alpha-alkylated
androgens
(
DA
(
IC50
,
116
nM
)
>
ST
>>
fluoxymesterone
>
mestaline
>
methandriol
>>
methandrostenolone
>
methyltestosterone
)
were
able
to
compete
with
[
3H
]
DEX
binding
to
liver
microsomes
.

ST
and
DA
were
potent
inhibitors
of
[
3H
]
DEX
binding
to
liver
microsomes
.

They
decreased
both
the
affinity
and
the
number
of
[
3H
]
DEX-binding
sites
,
increased
the
dissociation
rate
of
[
3H
]
DEX
from
the
LAGS
,
and
provoked
a
time-
and
dose-dependent
inactivation
of
the
[
3H
]
DEX-binding
site
.

These
results
strongly
suggest
that
ST
and
DA
exert
a
negative
allosteric
modulation
on
[
3H
]
DEX
binding
to
the
LAGS
.

The
in
vivo
administration
of
ST
(
but
not
other
androgens
)
to
male
rats
provoked
a
time-
and
dose-dependent
decrease
in
the
LAGS
level
.

Full
recovery
of
the
LAGS
concentration
required
at
least
8
h
and
was
blocked
by
protein
synthesis
inhibitors
.

Such
results
suggest
that
ST
irreversibly
inactivates
the
[
3H
]
DEX-binding
site
in
vivo
as
it
does
in
vitro
.

Taken
together
,
these
observations
are
indicative
of
an
irreversible
interaction
between
some
17
alpha-alkylated
androgens
and
the
LAGS
both
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
and
suggest
that
ST
may
be
an
important
pharmacological
tool
that
can
be
used
in
the
elucidation
of
the
molecular
structure
of
the
LAGS
.

These
results
also
mean
that
the
LAGS
are
a
steroid-binding
entity
able
to
distinguish
between
natural
androgens
and
17
alpha-alkylated
testosterone
derivatives
used
as
anabolic
agents
.
The
synthetic
progestins
used
so
far
for
contraception
and
menopausal
hormone
therapy
are
derived
either
from
testosterone
(
19-nortestosterone
derivatives
)
or
from
progesterone
(
17-OH
progesterone
derivatives
and
19-norprogesterone
derivatives
)
.

Among
the
19-nortestosterone
derivatives
,
the
estrane
group
include
norethisterone
(
NET
)
and
its
metabolites
,
and
the
gonane
group
include
levonorgestrel
(
LNG
)
and
its
derivatives
.

The
later
,
including
desogestrel
(
DSG
)
and
its
derivative
etonogestrel
,
gestodene
(
GES
)
and
norgestimate
(
norelgestromin
)
,
have
been
referred
to
as
third-generation
progestins
.

Several
new
progestins
have
been
synthesized
in
the
last
decade
and
may
be
considered
as
a
fourth-generation
of
progestins
.

Dienogest
is
referred
to
as
a
hybrid
progestin
being
derived
from
the
estrane
group
with
a
17alpha-cyanomethyl
group
,
and
drospirenone
derives
from
spirolactone
.

These
two
progestins
have
no
androgenic
effect
but
a
partial
antiandrogenic
effect
.

The
later
exerts
anti-mineralocorticoid
effects
.

This
property
leads
to
a
decreased
salt
and
water
retention
and
a
lowering
in
blood
pressure
in
users
of
pills
containing
this
progestin
.

The
19-norprogesterone
derivatives
appear
more
specifically
progestational
and
do
not
possess
any
androgenic
,
estrogenic
or
glucocorticoid
activity
.

They
are
referred
to
as
"pure"
progestational
molecules
as
they
bind
almost
exclusively
to
the
progesterone
receptor
(
PR
)
and
do
not
interfere
with
the
other
steroid
receptor
.

This
category
includes
,
trimegestone
,
nomegestrol
acetate
and
Nestorone
is
not
active
orally
but
proved
to
be
a
potent
anti-ovulatory
agent
when
given
in
implants
,
vaginal
rings
or
percutaneous
gel
.

Non-androgenic
progestins
would
appear
neutral
on
metabolic
factors
and
on
the
vessels
and
would
have
the
advantage
of
avoiding
acnea
.

Progestins
with
antiandrogenic
properties
may
also
be
used
for
the
treatment
of
women
with
preexisting
androgen
related
conditions
.

The
progestins
available
for
therapy
exhibit
profound
differences
according
to
their
structure
or
metabolites
and
it
is
inappropriate
to
consider
the
various
effects
of
the
old
and
new
molecules
as
class-effects
.

Using

subtype-selective
antagonists
chlorethylclonidine
(

)
,
WB4101
,
and
5-methyl-urapidil
,
we
have
examined
the
possible
heterogeneity
in
the
alpha
1-adrenoceptor
populations
in
rabbit
aorta
.

The
alpha
1-adrenoceptor
alkylating
agent
CEC
selectively
inhibited
the
phasic
component
of
the
norepinephrine-induced
contractile
response
,
with
little
effect
on
the
tonic
component
.

The
alpha
1-adrenoceptor
occupancy-response
relationship
defined
by
the
phenoxybenzamine
inactivation
method
was
rectangular
hyperbolic
for
the
tonic
response
,
whereas
that
for
the
phasic
response
was
linear
,
indicating
the
different
degree
of
receptor
reserve
for
the
two
responses
.

Radioligand
binding
studies
with
the
nonselective
alpha
1-adrenoceptor
antagonist
radioligand
125I-BE2254
showed
that
73-87%
of
the
binding
sites
in
rabbit
aorta
are
CEC
sensitive
and
they
are
predominantly
low
affinity
sites
both
for
WB4101
(
pKd
=
8
.
1
)
and
for
5-methylurapidil
(
pKd
=
7
.
1
)
.

Moreover
,
alpha
1-adrenoceptor-mediated
phosphatidylinositol
(
PI
)
hydrolysis
was
CEC
sensitive
,
and
fractional
inactivation
of
alpha
1
receptors
with
CEC
showed
equivalent
increments
in
the
reduction
of
PI
hydrolysis
and
phasic
contractile
response
,
suggesting
that
both
responses
are
linearly
related
to
the
CEC-sensitive
receptor
sites
.

The

for
the
competitive
antagonists
WB4101
and
5-methyl-urapidil

linear
and

However
,
the

were
curvilinear
.

Computer-assisted
analysis
of
these
curvilinear
Schild
plots
in
a
two-receptor
system
indicated
that
alpha
1-adrenoceptor
populations
responsible
for
the

predominantly
(
approximately
80-90%
)
low

.
Proline-rich
tyrosine
kinase
2
(
Pyk2
)
is
activated
by
various
agonists
in
platelets
.

We
evaluated
the
signaling
mechanism
and
the
functional
role
of
Pyk2
in
platelets
by
using
pharmacological
inhibitors
and
Pyk2-deficient
platelets
.

We
found
that
platelet
aggregation
and
secretion
in
response
to
2-MeSADP
and
AYPGKF
were
diminished
in
the
presence
of
Pyk2
inhibitors
or
in
Pyk2-deficient
platelets
,
suggesting
that
Pyk2
plays
a
positive
regulatory
role
in
platelet
functional
responses
.

It
has
been
shown
that
ADP-
,
but
not
thrombin-
,
induced
thromboxane
(
TxA2
)
generation
depends
on
integrin
signaling
.

Unlike
ADP
,
thrombin
activates
G12
/
13
pathways
,
and
G12
/
13
pathways
can
substitute
for
integrin
signaling
for
TxA2
generation
.

We
found
that
Pyk2
was
activated
downstream
of
both
G12
/
13
and
integrin-mediated
pathways
,
and
both
2-MeSADP-
and
AYPGKF-induced
TxA2
generation
was
significantly
diminished
in
Pyk2-deficient
platelets
.

In
addition
,
TxA2
generation
induced
by
co-stimulation
of
Gi
and
Gz
pathways
,
which
is
dependent
on
integrin
signaling
,
was
inhibited
by
blocking
Pyk2
.

Furthermore
,
inhibition
of
2-MeSADP-induced
TxA2
generation
by
fibrinogen
receptor
antagonist
was
not
rescued
by
co-stimulation
of
G12
/
13
pathways
in
the
presence
of
Pyk2
inhibitor
.

We
conclude
that
Pyk2
is
a
common
signaling
effector
downstream
of
both
G12
/
13
and
integrin
αIIbβ3
signaling
which
contributes
to
thromboxane
generation

need
the
activation
of
the

cascade
via
the
enzyme

(

.

5-Lox

and

and
finally
after

with

.

PBMCs
from

were
also
investigated
for

to
normal
parameters
.

Administration
of

reduced
significantly

and

(
P

)
,
with
no
effect
on
5-Lox
protein
expression
.

After
the
3-month
washout
,
all
parameters
were
comparable
to
those
observed
before
treatment
.

Our
results
resemble
those
obtained
after
oral
administration
of
vitamin
E
and
are
consistent
with
a
reversible
,
dose-dependent
inhibition
of
5-Lox
by
omega-3
.

Upregulation
of
5-Lox
may
also
be
related
to
the
increased
mitochondrial
damage
and
apoptosis
of
PBMCs
observed
in
ESRD
patients
compared
to
non-uremic
controls
.

Omega-3
may
thus
protect
PBMCs
of
ESRD
patients
against
oxidative
stress
.
The
M6P
(
mannose
6-phosphate
)
/
IGF2R
(
insulin-like
growth
factor
II
receptor
)
interacts
with
a
variety
of
factors
that
impinge
on
tumour
invasion
and
metastasis
.

It
has
been
shown
that
expression
of
wild-type
M6P
/
IGF2R
reduces
the
tumorigenic
and
invasive
properties
of
receptor-deficient
SCC-VII
squamous
cell
carcinoma
cells
.

We
have
now
used
mutant
forms
of
M6P
/
IGF2R
to
assess
the
relevance
of
the
different
ligand-binding
sites
of
the
receptor
for
its
biological
activities
in
this
cellular
system
.

The
results
of
the
present
study
demonstrate
that
M6P
/
IGF2R
does
not
require
a
functional
binding
site
for
insulin-like
growth
factor
II
for
inhibition
of
anchorage-independent
growth
and
matrix
invasion
by
SCC-VII
cells
.

In
contrast
,
the
simultaneous
mutation
of
both
M6P-binding
sites
is
sufficient
to
impair
all
cellular
functions
of
the
receptor
tested
.

These
findings
highlight
that
the
interaction
between
M6P
/
IGF2R
and
M6P-modified
ligands
is
not
only
important
for
intracellular
accumulation
of
lysosomal
enzymes
and
formation
of
dense
lysosomes
,
but
is
also
crucial
for
the
ability
of
the
receptor
to
suppress
SCC-VII
growth
and
invasion
.

The
present
study
also
shows
that
some
of
the
biological
activities
of
M6P
/
IGF2R
in
SCC-VII
cells
strongly
depend
on
a
functional
M6P-binding
site
within
domain
3
,
thus
providing
further
evidence
for
the
non-redundant
cellular
functions
of
the
individual
carbohydrate-binding
domains
of
the
receptor
.

Clinical
evidence
suggests
that
oxytocin
treatment
improves
social
deficits
and
repetitive
behavior
in
autism
spectrum
disorders
(
ASDs
)
.

However
,
the
neuropeptide
has
a
short
plasma
half-life
and
poor
ability
to
penetrate
the
blood-brain
barrier
.

In
order
to
facilitate
the
development
of
more
bioavailable
oxytocinergic
compounds
as
therapeutics
to
treat
core
ASD
symptoms
,
small
animal
models
must
be
validated
for
preclinical
screens
.

This
study
examined
the
preclinical
utility
of
two
inbred
mouse
strains
,
BALB
/
cByJ
and
C58
/
J
,
that
exhibit
phenotypes
relevant
to
core
ASD
symptoms
.

Mice
from
both
strains
were
intraperitoneally
administered
oxytocin
,
using
either
acute
or
sub-chronic
regimens
.

Acute
oxytocin
did
not
increase
sociability
in
BALB
/
cByJ;
however
,
sub-chronic
oxytocin
had
significant
prosocial
effects
in
both
BALB
/
cByJ
and
C58
/
J
.

Increased
sociability
was
observed
24
hours
following
the
final
oxytocin
dose
in
BALB
/
cByJ
,
while
prosocial
effects
of
oxytocin
emerged
1-2
weeks
post-treatment
in
C58
/
J
.

Furthermore
,
acute
oxytocin
decreased
motor
stereotypy
in
C58
/
J
and
did
not
induce
hypoactivity
or
anxiolytic-like
effects
in
an
open
field
test
.

This
study
demonstrates
that
oxytocin
administration
can
attenuate
social
deficits
and
repetitive
behavior
in
mouse
models
of
ASD
,
dependent
on
dose
regimen
and
genotype
.

These
findings
provide
validation
of
the
BALB
/
cByJ
and
C58
/
J
models
as
useful
platforms
for
screening
novel
drugs
for
intervention
in
ASDs
and
for
elucidating
the
mechanisms
contributing
to
the
prosocial
effects
of
oxytocin
.

Inspired
by
the
water-enhanced
mechanical
gradient
character
of
the
squid
beak
,
we
herein
report
a
nanocomposite
that
mimics
both
the
architecture
and
properties
of
this
interesting
natural
material
.

Similar
to
the
squid
beak
,
we
have
developed
nanocomposites
where
the
degree
of
cross-linking
is
controlled
along
the
length
of
the
film
.

In
this
study
,
we
utilized
tunicate
cellulose
nanocrystals
as
the
nanofiller
that
are
functionalized
with
allyl
moieties
.

Using
photoinduced
thiol-ene
chemistry
,
we
have
been
able
to
cross-link
the
CNC
nanofiller
.

In
the
dry
state
where
strong
CNC
interactions
can
occur
,
only
a
small
mechanical
contrast
is
observed
between
the
cross-linked
and
uncross-linked
samples
.

However
,
when
the
films
are
exposed
to
water
,
which
"switches
off"
the
noncovalent
CNC
interactions
,
a
significant
mechanical
contrast
is
observed
between
the
same
films
.

For
example
,
at
20
wt
%
CNC
(
in
the
dry
film
)
,
an
increase
in
wet
modulus
from
60
to
300
MPa
(
∼500%
increase
)
is
observed
after
photoirradiation
.

Furthermore
,
we
show
that
the
wet
modulus
can
be
controlled
by
altering
the
UV
exposure
time
which
allows
access
to
mechanical

The

of
various
important
drugs
are
known
to
be
significantly
influenced
by
the
human
ABC
transporter
P-glycoprotein

,
which
may
lead
to
clinically
relevant
drug-drug

.

In

to
therapeutic
drugs
,
emerging
drugs
of

(
DOA
)
are
sold
and
consumed
without
any
safety

Only
some
studies
on
their
metabolism
were
published
,
but
none
about
their
affinity
to
the
transporter
systems
.

Therefore
,
47
DOAs
from
various
classes
were
tested
for
their
P-gp
affinity
using
human
P-gp
(
hP-gp
)
to
predict
possible
drug-drug
interactions
.

DOAs
were
initially
screened
for
general
hP-gp
affinity

further
characterized
by
modeling
classic
Michaelis-Menten

assessing
their
K

Prominent

the
ISWI
ATPase
domain
with
a
C-terminal
DNA-binding
function
residing
in
the
HAND-SANT-SLIDE
(

Contrary
to
these
models
,
we
show
by
quantitative
biochemical
means
that
all
fundamental
aspects
of
nucleosome
remodeling
are
contained
within
the
compact
ATPase
module
of
Drosophila
ISWI
.

This
domain
can
independently
associate
with
DNA
and
nucleosomes
,
which
in
turn
activate
ATP
turnover
by
inducing
a
conformational
change
in
the
enzyme
,
and
it
can
autonomously
reposition
nucleosomes
.

The
role
of
the
HSS
domain
is
to
increase
the
affinity
and
specificity
for
nucleosomes
.

Nucleosome-remodeling
enzymes
may
thus
have
evolved
directly
from
ancestral
helicase-type
motors
,
and
peripheral
domains
have
furnished
regulatory
capabilities
that
bias
the

X-linked
hypophosphatemic
rickets
(
XLH
)
is
a
genetic
disorder
caused
by
mutational
inactivation
of
the
PHEX
gene
,
encoding
a
transmembrane
endopeptidase
expressed
in
osteoblasts
.

Since
several
experiments
involving
Phex-deficient
Hyp
mice
have
demonstrated
that
an
increased
expression
of
Fgf23
in
osteoblasts
is
causative
for
the
renal
phosphate
loss
characteristic
of
XLH
,
we
performed
genome-wide
expression
analysis
to
compare
differentiated
osteoblasts
from
wildtype
and
Hyp
mice
.

Here
we
did
not
only
observe
the
expected
increase
of
Fgf23
expression
in
the
latter
ones
,
but
also
a
differential
expression
of
genes
that
are
either
induced
by
or
involved
in
retinoic
acid
signaling
,
which
led
us
to
analyze
whether
dietary
retinol
deprivation
would
influence
the
phenotype
of
Hyp
mice
.

Unexpectedly
,
feeding
a
retinol-free
diet
resulted
in
a
partial
rescue
of
the
growth
plate
and
bone
mineralization
defects
in
6
weeks
old
Hyp
mice
.

When
we
fed
the
same
diet
for
24
weeks
the
amount
of
non-mineralized
bone
matrix
(
osteoid
)
was
reduced
by
more
than
70%
,
although
phosphate
homeostasis
was
unaffected
.

In
contrast
,
a
dietary
normalization
of
serum
phosphate
levels
in
Hyp
mice
reduced
the
osteoid
amount
by
less
than
30%
,
thereby
demonstrating
a
previously
unknown
impact
of
retinol
on
the
cell-autonomous
mineralization
defect
of
Phex-deficient
osteoblasts

)
-propranolol
and
the
5-HT
(

The

although
the

antagonist
ketanserin
was
without
effect
.

Clomipramine-induced
hyperglycemia
was
reduced
by
prior

.

These
results
suggest
that
clomipramine
induces
hyperglycemia
in
mice
by
blocking
the
5-HT
(

Unlike
the
sedative
hypnotics
that
target
GABA

A
)
receptor
complexes
,
ramelteon
is
a
chronohypnotic
that
acts
on
the
melatonin
MT
(

)
and
MT
(
2
)
receptors
,
which
are
primarily
located
in
the
suprachiasmatic
nucleus
,
the
body's
"master
clock
.

"
As
such
,
ramelteon
possesses
the
first
new
therapeutic
mechanism
of
action
for
a
prescription
insomnia
medication
in
over
three
decades
.

Ramelteon

demonstrated
sleep-promoting
effects
in
clinical
trials
,
and
coupled
with
its
favorable
safety
profile
and
lack
of
abuse
potential
or
dependence
,
this
chronohypnotic
provides
an
important
treatment
option
for

are
antimetabolites
which
are
metabolized
to
their

active
forms
which
inhibit
DNA
synthesis
via

of

(

.

To
investigate
ways
of
overcoming
5-FU-resistance
,
we
established
acquired-resistant
colorectal
cancer
cell
lines
against
these
three
drugs
by
continuous
and
step-wise
escalation
of
drugs
,
and
analyzed
the
cytotoxicity
and
the
mechanism
of
resistance
to
the
drugs
.

When
cells
were
incubated
with
the
3
drugs
for
72
h
,
the
resistance
ratio
to
parental
DLD-1
human
colorectal
tumor
cells
was
65
.

for

for

and

.
6
for

cells
.

DLD-1
/
5-FU
cells
did
not
show
any
cross-resistance
against
FdUrd
and
F
(

)
dThd
.

However
,
DLD-1
/
FdUrd
cells
showed
3-
and
9-fold
increased
resistance
to
5-FU
and
F3
(
d
)
Thd
,
respectively
,
and
DLD-1
/
F3
(
d
)
Thd
cells
also
showed
about
90-fold
resistance
to
FdUrd
.

Analysis
of
enzyme
activities
and
gene
expression
associated
with
pyrimidine
metabolism
indicated
that
a
significant
decrease
in
orotate
phosphoribosyltransferase
activity
in
DLD-1
/
5-FU
cells
,
a
7-fold
increase
of
TS
mRNA
in
DLD-1
/
FdUrd
cells
,
and
a
37-fold
decrease
in
thymidine
kinase
activity
of
DLD-1
/
F3
(
d
)
Thd
cells
were
the
major
mechanisms
of
drug
resistance
.

These
findings
were
closely
associated
with
the
cytotoxicity
of
5-FU
,
FdUrd
and
F3
(
d
)
Thd
against
the
established
5-FU-
,
FdUrd-
or
F3
(
d
)
Thd-resistant
cells
.

When
DLD-1
/
FdUrd
cells
expressing
increased
TS
mRNA
were
treated
with
FdUrd
and
F3
(
d
)
Thd
for
only
4
h
,
the
resistance
ratios
of
DLD-1
/
FdUrd
cells
to
parental
DLD-1
cells
were
markedly
different
for
FdUrd
and
F3
(
d
)
Thd
,
suggesting
that
the
cytotoxicity
with
short-time
exposure
to
F3
(
d
)
Thd
is
due
to
a
mechanism
other
than
TS
inhibition
,
although
the
cytotoxicity
of
F3
(
d
)
Thd
in
the
short-time
is
low
compared
to
that
of
long-time
exposure
.

In
conclusion
,
F3
(
d
)
Thd
,
an
antimetabolite
that
inhibits
TS
activity
,
may
be
effective
against
5-FU
and
/
or
FdUrd-resistance
in
colorectal
cancer
cells
caused
by
amplification
of
TS
and
/
or
deletion
of
orotate

Excellent
glycaemic
control
is
essential
in
pregnancy
to
optimise
maternal
and
foetal
outcomes
.

The
aim
of
this
review
is
to
assess
the
efficacy
and
safety
of
insulin
analogues
in
pregnancy
.

Insulin
lispro
and
insulin
aspart
are
safe
in
pregnancy
and
may
improve
post-prandial
glycaemic
control
in
women
with
type
1
diabetes
.

However
,
a
lack
of
data
indicating
improved
foetal
outcomes
would
suggest
that
there
is
no
imperative
to
switch
to
a
short-acting
analogue
where
the
woman's
diabetes
is
well
controlled
with
human
insulin
.

There
are
no
reports
of
the
use
of
insulin
glulisine
in
pregnancy
and
so
its
use
cannot
be
recommended
.

Most
studies
of
insulin
glargine
in
pregnancy
are
small
,
retrospective
and
include
women
with
pre-existing
diabetes
and
gestational
diabetes
.

There
appear
to
be
no
major
safety
concerns
and
so
it
seems
reasonable
to
continue
insulin
glargine
if
required
to
achieve
excellent
glycaemic
control
.

A
head-to-head
comparison
between
insulin
detemir
and
NPH
insulin
in
women
with
type
1
diabetes
showed
that
while
foetal
outcomes
did
not
differ
,
fasting
plasma
glucose
improved
with
insulin
detemir
without
an
increased
incidence
of
hypoglycaemia
.

The
greater
evidence
base
supports
the
use
of
insulin
detemir
as
the
first
line
long-acting
analogue
in
pregnancy
but
the
lack
of
definitive
foetal
benefits
means
that
there
is
no
strong
need
to
switch
a
woman
who
is
well
controlled
on
NPH
insulin
.

There
seems
little
justification
in
using
long
acting
insulin
analogues
in
women
with
gestational
diabetes
or
type
2
diabetes
where
the
risk
of
hypoglycaemia
is
low
.
Hedgehog
Signaling
Pathway
and
Cancer
Therapeutics
:
Progress
to
Date
.
The
Janus
family
kinases
(
JAKs
)
,
JAK1
,
JAK2
,
JAK3
,
and
TYK2
,
are
involved
in
cell
growth
,
survival
,
development
,
and
differentiation
of
a
variety
of
cells
,
particularly
immune
cells
and
hematopoietic
cells
.

They
form
a
subgroup
of
the
non-receptor
protein
tyrosine
kinases
.

Activating
mutations
within
each
of
the
JAKs
is
associated
with
malignant
transformations;
the
most
common
are
mutations
of
JAK2
in
polycythemia
vera
(
PV
)
and
other
myeloproliferative
neoplasms
(
MPN
)
.

Identification
of
the
V617F
mutation
of
the
JAK2
gene
(
JAK2
V617F
)
led
to
an
important
breakthrough
in
the
understanding
of
MPN
disease
pathogenesis
.

The
JAK2
V617F
mutation
is
present
in
the
majority
of
PV
patients
,
and
about
50%
of
patients
with
essential
thrombocythemia
(
ET
)
and
primary
myelofibrosis
(
PMF
)
are
affected
.

This
mutation
leads
to
hyperactivation
of
JAK2
,
cytokine-independent
signaling
,
and
subsequent
activation
of
downstream
signaling
networks
.

JAK2
ATP-competitive
inhibitors
that
indirectly
inhibit
the
JAK-STAT
pathway
are
new
candidates
for
the
treatment
of
MPN
.

JAK2
inhibitors
in
development
for
the
treatment
of
MPN
have
demonstrated
clinical
activity
with
minimal
toxicity
.

These
agents
consistently
alleviate
constitutional
symptoms
and
reduce
spleen
size
in
PMF
and
other
MPN
.

However
,
some
of
these
inhibitors
have
additional
unique
effects
.

Ruxolitinib
causes
a
significant
reduction
in
the
level
of
pro-inflammatory
cytokines
.

Another
inhibitor
,
CYT387
,
improves
anemia
.

Many
other
JAK2
inhibitors
such
as
TG101348
or
SAR302503
,
SB1518
,
CEP701
and
LY2784544
are
now
under
investigation
for
MPN
development
.

In
contrast
tasocitinib
,
a
predominantly
JAK3
inhibitor
,
is
being
evaluated
in
a
number
of
inflammatory
and
immunological
diseases
,
including
rheumatoid
arthritis
,
psoriasis
,
ulcerative
colitis
,
dry
eye
disease
and
in
kidney
transplant
patients
.

In
conclusion
the
use
of
JAK
inhibitors
in
MPN
and
some
of
the
immune-mediated
disorders
is
a
promising
new
strategy
for
therapy
.

However
,
definitive
data
from
ongoing
and
future
preclinical
and
clinical
trials
will
aid
in
better
defining
the
status
of
these
drugs
in
the
treatment
of
these
diseases
.
BACKGROUND
:
CYP2C9
polymorphisms
are
associated
with
decreased
S-warfarin
clearance
and
lower
maintenance
dosage
.

Decreased
expression
of
VKORC1
resulting
from
the
-1639G>A
substitution
has
also
been
implicated
in
lower
warfarin
dose
requirements
.

We
investigated
the
additional
contribution
of
this
polymorphism
to
the
variance
in
warfarin
dose
.

METHODS
:
Sixty-five
patients
with
stable
anticoagulation
were
genotyped
for
CYP2C9
and
VKORC1
with
Tag-It
allele-specific
primer
extension
technology
.

Plasma
S-warfarin
concentrations
and
warfarin
maintenance
dose
were
compared
among
patients
on
the
basis
of
the
VKORC1
-1639G>A
genotype
.

RESULTS
:
Eighty
percent
of
CYP2C9*1
/

patients
stabilized
on
<4

0

had
at

1

genotypes
,
respectively
.

Steady-state
plasma
concentrations
of
S-warfarin
were
lowest
in
patients
with
the
VKORC1
-1639AA
genotype
and
demonstrated
a
positive
association

A
model

,
age
,
sex
,
and
body
weight
accounted
for
61%
of
the
variance
in
warfarin
daily
maintenance
dose
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
The
VKORC1
-1639A
allele
accounts
for
low
dosage
requirements
of
most
patients
without
a
CYP2C9
variant
.

Higher
plasma
S-warfarin
concentrations
corresponding
to
increased
warfarin
maintenance
dosages
support
a
hypothesis
for
increased
expression
of
the
VKORC1
-1639G
allele
.

VKORC1
and
CYP2C9

Abstract
This

aimed
to

the
role
of

and
Piper

extracts
in
ameliorating
neuroinflammatory
insults
characteristic
of

Adult

were
classified
into

:
the

.

After
AD

,
animals
in
the
AD-induced
group
were
divided
randomly
and
equally
into
6
subgroups
.

The
first
subgroup
served
as
AD
control;
the
second
one
,
which
served
as
positive

,
was

The
results
showed
that

Treatment
of

of
the
selected

In

triloba

have
potent
anti-inflammatory
effects
against

Due
to
the
increasing
prevalence
of
type
2
diabetes
mellitus
(
T2DM
)
,
the
emergent
trend
towards
diagnosis
in
younger
patients
and
the
progressive
nature
of
this
disease
,
many
more
patients
than
before
now
require
insulin
to
maintain
glycaemic
control
.

However
,
there
is
a
degree
of
inertia
among
physicians
and
patients
regarding
the
initiation
and
intensification
of
insulin
therapy
,
in
part
due
to
concerns
about
the
associated
weight
gain
and
increased
risk
of
hypoglycaemia
.

Glucagon-like
peptide-1
receptor
agonists
(
GLP-1RAs
)
increase
insulin
release
and
suppress
glucagon
secretion
in
a
glucose-dependent
manner
,
thus
conferring
glycaemic
control
with
a
low
incidence
of
hypoglycaemia
.

GLP-1RAs
also
promote
weight
loss
,
and
have
beneficial
effects
on
markers
of
β
cell
function
,
lipid
levels
,
blood
pressure
and
cardiovascular
risk
markers
.

However
,
the
durability
of
their
effectiveness
is
unknown
and
,
compared
with
insulin
,
the
antihyperglycaemic
efficacy
of
GLP-1RAs
is
limited
.

The
combination
of
a
GLP-1RA
and
insulin
might
thus
be
highly
effective
for
optimal
glucose
control
,
ameliorating
the
adverse
effects
typically
associated
with
insulin
.

Data
from
clinical
studies
support
the
therapeutic
potential
of
GLP-1RA-insulin
combination
therapy
,
typically
showing
beneficial
effects
on
glycaemic
control
and
body
weight
,
with
a
low
incidence
of
hypoglycaemia
and
,
in
established
insulin
therapy
,
facilitating
reductions
in
insulin
dose
.

In
this
review
,
the
physiological
and
pharmacological
rationale
for
using
GLP-1RA
and
insulin
therapies
in
combination
is
discussed
,
and
data
from
clinical
studies
that
have
assessed
the
efficacy
and
safety
of
this
treatment
strategy
are

Olopatadine
hydrochloride
(
olopatadine
)
is
an
antiallergic
drug
with
histamine
H
(
1
)
receptor
antagonistic
activity
.

Recently
,
olopatadine
has
been
shown
to
bind
to
S100A12
which
is
a
member
of
the
S100
family
of
calcium-binding
proteins
,
and
exerts
multiple
proinflammatory
activities
including
chemotaxis
for
monocytes
and
neutrophils
.

In
this
study
,
we
examined
the
possibility
that
the
interaction
of
olopatadine
with
S100A12
inhibits
the
proinflammatory
effects
of
S100A12
.

Pretreatment
of
olopatadine
with
S100A12
reduced
migration
of
THP-1
,
a
monocyte
cell
line
,
induced
by
S100A12
alone
,
but
did
not
affect

human
regulated

activation
,
normal
T
cell
expressed
and
secreted
(
RANTES
)
-induced
migration
.

Amlexanox
,
which
also
binds
to
S100A12
,
inhibited
the
THP-1
migration
induced
by
S100A12
.

However
,
ketotifen
,
another
histamine
H
(
1
)
receptor
antagonist
,
had
little
effect
on
the
activity
of
S100A12
.

These
results
suggest
that
olopatadine
has
a
new
mechanism
of
action
,
that
is
,
suppression
of
the
function
of
S100A12
,

The
thioredoxin
reductase
/
thioredoxin
system
(
TrxR
/
Trx1
)
plays
a
major
role
in
protecting
cells
from
oxidative
stress
.

Disruption
of
the
TrxR-Trx1
system
keeps
Trx1
in
the
oxidized
state
leading
to
cell
death
through
activation
of
the
ASK1-Trx1
apoptotic
pathway
.

The
potential
mechanism
and
ability
of
tri-
and
tetra-oligopeptides
derived
from
the
canonical
-CxxC-
motif
of
the
Trx1-active
site
to
mimic
and
enhance
Trx1
cellular
activity
was
examined
.

The
Trx
mimetics
peptides
(
TXM
)
protected
insulinoma
INS
832
/
13
cells
from
oxidative
stress
induced
by
selectively
inhibiting
TrxR
with
auranofin
(
AuF
)
.

TXM
reversed
the
AuF-effects
preventing
apoptosis
,
and
increasing
cell-viability
.

The
TXM
peptides
were
effective
in
inhibiting
AuF-induced
MAPK
,
JNK
and
p38
(
MAPK
)
phosphorylation
,
in
correlation
with
preventing
caspase-3
cleavage
and
thereby
PARP-1
dissociation
.

The
ability
to
form
a
disulfide-bridge-like
conformation
was
estimated
from
molecular
dynamics
simulations
.

The
TXM
peptides
restored
insulin
secretion
and
displayed
Trx1
denitrosylase
activity
.

Their
potency
was
10-100-fold
higher
than
redox
reagents
like
NAC
,
AD4
,
or
ascorbic
acid
.

Unable
to
reverse
ERK1
/
2
phosphorylation
,
TXM-CB3
(
NAc-Cys-Pro-Cys
amide
)
appeared
to
function
in
part
,
through
inhibiting
ASK1-Trx
dissociation
.

These
highly
effective
anti-apoptotic
effects
of
Trx1
mimetic
peptides
exhibited
in
INS
832
/

cells
could
become
valuable
in
treating
adverse

disorders

Reduced
nitric

(
NO
)
bioavailability
and
impaired
vascular
function
are
the
key
pathological
characteristics
of
inflammatory
diseases
such
as
atherosclerosis
.

We
have
recently
found
that
leukocyte-derived
hypochlorous
acid
is
able
to
react
with
the
nitric-oxide
synthase
(
NOS
)
substrate
L-arginine
to
produce
chlorinated
L-arginine
(
cl-L-Arg
)
.

Interestingly
,
cl-L-Arg
potently
inhibits
the
formation
of
NO
metabolites
in
cultured
endothelial
cells
.

It
is
unknown
whether
cl-L-Arg
has
a
direct
inhibitory
effect
on
endothelial
NOS
(
eNOS
)
.

In
addition
,
the
effect
of
cl-L-Arg
on
the
other
NOS
isoforms
,
neuronal
NOS
(
nNOS
)
and
inducible
NOS
(
iNOS
)
,
is
also
unknown
.

Therefore
,
we
designed
the
current
study
to
test
the
effects
of
cl-L-Arg
on
eNOS
,
nNOS
,
and
iNOS
.

Using
recombinant
NOS
,
we
found
that
cl-L-Arg
had
a
direct
inhibitory
effect
on
the
activity
of
NOS
.

The
effect
of
cl-L-Arg
on
NOS
activity
is
nonselective
,
as
all
three
NOS
isoforms
were
inhibited
with
a
similar
IC
(
50
)
.

We
further
determined
the
effect
of
cl-L-Arg
on
the
three
NOS
isoforms
at
the
tissue
level
.

The
results
demonstrated
that
cl-L-Arg
potently
inhibited
all
three
NOS
isoform-mediated
vessel
reactivities
,
as
well
as
the
NOS
signaling
molecule
cGMP
.

Cl-L-Arg
might
serve
as
a
novel
endogenous
NOS
inhibitor
and
an
important
mediator
for
vascular
dysfunction
under
inflammatory
conditions
such
as
atherosclerosis
.

Blocking
cl-L-Arg
formation
may
be
a
new
therapeutic
approach
to
cardiovascular
diseases

binding
of

The

estramustine
could
not
induce
luciferase

in
either
w-pAR0

In
contrast
,
a
strong

dihydrotestosterone
was
observed
.

Down-regulation
of
prostate-specific
antigen
(

an
AR-target
gene
,
by
estramustine
and
bicalutamide
was
accompanied
by
the
blockade
of
the
mutated
androgen
receptor
.

Exposure
of
LNCaP
cells
to
estramustine
for
24
hr
caused
transcriptional
inhibition
of
PSA
in
a
concentration-dependent
manner
.

The
levels
of
PSA
mRNA
decreased
56
and
90%
when
LNCaP
cells
were
treated
with
5
and
10

,
respectively
(

.

Binding
of
hydroxyflutamide
to
m-AR
in

resulted
in
a
concentration-dependent
stimulation
of
PSA
expression
,
suggesting
that

Group
III
metabotropic
glutamate
(
mGlu
)
receptors
are
localized
in
presynaptic
terminals
within
basal
ganglia
(
BG
)
circuitry
that
become
hyperactive
due
to
dopamine
depletion
in
Parkinson's
disease
(
PD
)
.

For
this
reason
,
group
III
mGlu
receptors
,
in
particular
mGlu4
,
have
been
considered
as
key
strategic
targets
for
non-dopaminergic
pharmacological
treatments
aimed
at
modulating
these
synapses
,
without
producing
the
well
known
side-effects
of
l-DOPA
,
in
particular
the
highly
disabling
l-DOPA-induced
dyskinesia
(
LID
)
.

Herein
we
add
physiological
and
functional
support
to
this
hypothesis
using
Lu
AF21934
,
a
novel
selective
and
brain-penetrant
mGlu4
receptor
positive
allosteric
modulator
(
PAM
)
tool
compound
.

By
in

electrophysiological
recordings
we
demonstrate
that
Lu
AF21934
inhibits
corticostriatal
synaptic
transmission
and
enhances
the
effect
of
the
orthosteric
mGlu4
receptor-preferred
agonist
LSP1-2111
.

In
naïve
rats
,
Lu
AF21934
dose-dependently
(
10
and
30
mg
/
kg
)
alleviated
haloperidol-induced
catalepsy
.

In
hemiparkinsonian
rats
(
unilateral
6-hydroxydopamine
lesion
of
the
substantia
nigra
pars
compacta
)
,
Lu
AF21934
alone
did
not
affect
akinesia
at
the
doses
tested
(
10
and
30
mg
/
kg
)
.

However
,
when
Lu
AF21934
was
combined
with
sub-threshold
doses
of
l-DOPA
(
1
and
5
mg
/
kg
)
,
it
acted
synergistically
in
alleviating
akinesia
in
a
dose-dependent
manner
and
,
notably
,
also
reduced
the
incidence
of
LID
but
not
its
severity
.

Interestingly
,
these
effects
occurred
at
Lu
AF21934
brain
free
concentrations
that
showed
functional
activity
in
in
vitro
screens
(
calcium
flux
and
electrophysiology
assays
)
.

These
results
support
the
potential
for
antiparkinsonian
clinical
use
of
a
combined
treatment
consisting
in
l-DOPA
and
a
mGlu4
receptor
PAM
to
reduce
efficacious
l-DOPA
doses
(
generally
known
as
l-DOPA
sparing
)
,
while
maintaining
the
same
benefit
on
PD
motor
troubles
,
and
at
the
same
time
minimizing
the
development
of

The
endogenous
compound
hydroxylamine
relaxes
vascular
smooth
muscle
in
vitro
,
apparently
through
conversion
to
the
vasodilator
factor
nitric
oxide
,
but
its
effect
on
blood
pressure
has
not
been
characterized
.

We
found
that
in
the
anesthetized
rat
the
amine
elicits
dose-related
hypotension
when
administered
by
continuous
iv
infusion
.

In
experiments
designed
to
explore
the
mechanism
of
this
effect
,
hydroxylamine
was
compared
with
the
nitric
oxide
donor
nitroprusside
and
the
direct-acting
vasodilator
hydralazine
,
using
pretreatments
known
to
modify
diverse
mechanisms
of
vasodilation
.

Hydroxylamine
hypotension
was
enhanced
by
the
SSAO
inhibitor
isoniazid
and
the
SSAO
substrate
methylamine
,
a
pattern
shared
by
hydralazine
.

Responses
were
blocked
by
the
guanylate
cyclase
inhibitor
methylene
blue
and
were
increased
by
the
nitric
oxide
synthase
inhibitor
L-NAME
,
a
pattern
shared
by
nitroprusside
.

It
was
concluded
that
hydroxylamine
exerts
hypotension
partly
through
conversion
to
nitric
oxide
and
partly
by
a
"hydralazine-like"
mechanism
involving
SSAO
inhibition
.
We
describe
a
45-year-old
Taiwanese
man
with
specific
features

syndrome
but
no

disease

He
was
successfully
treated
with
an
implantable
cardioverter-defibrillator
.

His
electrocardiogram
(
ECG
)
patterns
changed
intermittently
.

Alpha-adrenoceptor
stimulation
and
beta-adrenoceptor
blockade
augmented
the
characteristic
ST-segment
elevation
,
whereas
alpha-adrenoceptor
blockade
and
beta-adrenoceptor
stimulation
mitigated
the
ST-segment
elevation
.

Intravenous
procainamide
administration
did
not
aggravate
ST-segment
elevation
when
ECG
had
shown
coved
ST
elevation
in
the
right
precordial
leads
.

Molecular
study
did
not
reveal
the
same
mutations
in
the
cardiac
sodium
channel
gene
(
SCN5A
)
as
previously
reported
in
Brugada
syndrome
.

This
case
demonstrates
the
genetic
heterogeneity
of
SCN5A
in
Brugada
syndrome
.
BACKGROUND
AND
PURPOSE
:
Voltage-operated
sodium
channels
constitute
major
target
sites
for
local
anaesthetic-like
action
.

The
clinical
use
of
local
anaesthetics
is
still
limited
by
severe
side
effects
,
in
particular
,
arrhythmias
and
convulsions
.

These
side
effects
render
the
search
for
new
local
anaesthetics
a
matter
of
high
interest
.

EXPERIMENTAL
APPROACH
:
We
have
investigated
the
effects
of
three
halogenated
structural
analogues
of
propofol
on
voltage-operated
human
skeletal
muscle
sodium
channels
(
Na
(
V
)
1
.
4
)
and
the
effect
of
one
compound
(
4-chloropropofol
)
on
neuronal
sodium
channels
(
Na
(
V
)
1
.
2
)
heterologously
expressed
in
human
embryonic
kidney
cell
line
293
.

KEY
RESULTS
:
4-Iodo-
,
4-bromo-
and
4-chloropropofol
reversibly
suppressed
depolarization-induced
whole-cell
sodium
inward
currents
with
high
potency
.

The
IC
(
50
)
for
block
of
resting
channels
at
-150
mV
was
2

microM

respectively
,
and
29
.
2
microM
for
4-chloropropofol
in
Na
(
V
)
1
.
2
.

Membrane
depolarization
inducing
inactivation
strongly
increased
the
blocking
potency
of
all
compounds
.

Estimated
affinities
for
the
fast-inactivated
channel
state
were
81
nM
,
312
nM
and
227
nM
for
4-iodopropofol
,
4-bromopropofol
and
4-chloropropofol
in
Na
(
V
)
1
.
4
,
and
450
nM
for
4-chloropropofol
in
Na
(
V
)
1
.
2
.

Recovery
from
fast
inactivation
was
prolonged
in
the
presence
of
drug
leading
to
an
accumulation
of
block
during
repetitive
stimulation
at
high
frequencies
(
100
Hz
)
.

CONCLUSIONS
AND
IMPLICATIONS
:
Halogenated
propofol
analogues
constitute
a
novel
class
of
sodium
channel-blocking
drugs
possessing
almost
100-fold
higher
potency
compared
with
the
local
anaesthetic
and
anti-arrhythmic
drug
lidocaine
.

Preferential
drug
binding
to
inactivated
channel
states

that
halogenated
propofol
analogues
might
be
especially
effective
in

When
the

with

(

The

affects
the

action
on

.

The
drug
significantly
inhibited
tail

more
potently
during
shorter

(
<600

.

Bepridil's
block
was
therefore
time

,
and
its
binding
affinity
to
the

was
greater
in
the
closed

,
as
evidenced
by
unblocking

These

Relaxin
is
a
polypeptide
hormone
involved
in
remodeling
of
the
birth
canal
during
parturition
.

It
is
synthesized
as
a
preprohormone
precursor
,
which
undergoes
specific
processing
to
form
the
mature
two-chain
disulfide-linked
active
species
that
is
secreted
by
the
cell
.

A
major
part
of
this
processing
requires
endoproteolytic
cleavage
at
specific
pairs
of
basic
amino
acid
residues
,
an
event
necessary
for
the
maturation
of
a
variety
of
important
biologically
active
proteins
,
such
as
insulin
and
nerve
growth
factor
.

Human
type
2
preprorelaxin
was
coexpressed
in
human
kidney
293
cells
with
the
candidate
prohormone
convertase-processing
enzymes
mPC1
or
mPC2
,
both
cloned
from
the
mouse
pituitary
tumor
AtT-20
cell
line
,
or
with
the
yeast
kex2
alpha-mating
factor-converting
enzyme
from
Saccharomyces
cerevisiae
.

Prorelaxin
expressed
alone
in
293
cells
was
secreted
into
the
culture
medium
unprocessed
.

Transient
coexpression
with
mPC1
or
kex2
,
but
not
with
mPC2
,
resulted
in
the
secretion
of
a
low
mol
wt
species
with
an
electrophoretic
mobility
very
similar
,
if
not
identical
,
to
that
of
authentic
mature
relaxin
purified
from
human
placenta
.

This
species
was
precipitable
by
monoclonal
antibodies
specific
for
relaxin
and
had
a
retention
time
on
reverse
phase
HPLC
comparable
to
that
of
relaxin
.

Its
analysis
by
both
electrospray
and
fast
atom
bombardment
mass
spectrometry
generated
mass
data
that
were
consistent
only
with
mature
relaxin
.

The
basic
residues
required
for
mPC1-dependent
cleavage
of
prorelaxin
are
defined
by
site-directed

(

through
simultaneous

.

We
examined
the
effects
of
omapatrilat
in
a
placebo-controlled
crossover
study
using
a
pacing
model
of
HF
.

Seven
sheep
were
paced
sequentially
at
180
bpm
(
mild
HF
)
and
then
225
bpm
(
severe

)
for
7
days
each
.

Omapatrilat

)
or
vehicle
was
administered
by
intravenous
bolus
on
days
4
to
7
of
each
paced
period
.

Omapatrilat
lowered
mean
arterial

left
atrial
pressure
and
increased
cardiac
output
acutely
and
chronically
in
both
mild
and
severe
HF
(
P<0

all
)
.

Plasma
atrial
and
brain
natriuretic
peptide
and
cGMP
levels
were
stable
acutely
(
P

)
,
while
brain
natriuretic
peptide
increased
after
repeated
dosing
in
severe
HF
(
P<0

)
.

Plasma
renin
activity
rose
,
whereas
angiotensin

and
aldosterone
levels
fell
after
acute
and
repeated
dosing
in
both
states
(
P<0

.

Omapatrilat
increased
urinary
sodium
excretion
by

in
both
mild

.

Effective
renal

rate
increased
or
were
stable
after
omapatrilat
in

after

Omapatrilat
exhibited

Cigarette
smoke
is
the
major
cause
of
chronic
obstructive
pulmonary
disease
(
COPD
)
,
yet
pathogenic
mechanisms
are
not
fully
understood
.

Vascular
endothelial
growth
factor
(
VEGF
)
is
one
of
the
major
regulators
of
endothelial
cell
survival
and
is
believed
to
play
a
role
in
the
pathogenesis
of
COPD
.

Fibroblasts
are
a
significant
source
of
VEGF
in
the
lungs;
however
the
effect
of
cigarette
smoke
exposure
on
VEGF
release
by
fibroblasts
is
not
fully
understood
.

We
hypothesized
that
cigarette
smoke-induced
disturbed
VEGF
release
by
human
lung
fibroblasts
is
a
potential
pathogenic
mechanism
that
could
contribute
to
COPD
.

Cigarette
smoke
extract
(
CSE
)
was
prepared
by
modification
of
the
methods
of
Carp
and
Janoff
(
American
Review
of
Respiratory
Disease
,
1978
)
.

Human
fetal
lung
fibroblasts
(
HFL-1
)
were
exposed
to
different
concentrations
of
CSE
and
for
different
durations
.

VEGF
release
into
the
media
was
measured
using
ELISA
.

TGF-β1
receptor
(
TβR1
)
/
Smad3
as
a
potential
pathway
for
CSE
modulated
VEGF
release
was
also
investigated
using
biochemical
analyses
and
siRNA
inhibition
of
Smad3
and
siRNA
and
pharmacologic
inhibition
of
TβR1
.

CSE
induced
VEGF
release
by
HFL-1
in
concentration
and
time
dependent
manner
.

This
was
confirmed
in
two
additional
types
of
primary
human
fetal
lung
fibroblasts
.

CSE
induced
Smad3
phosphorylation
and
nuclear
translocation
in
HFL-1
cells
.

Silencing
of
Smad3
by
siRNA
not
only
eliminated
the
stimulatory
effect
of
CSE
on
VEGF
release
but
also
inhibited
baseline
VEGF
production
.

Suppression
of
TβR1
by
the
pharmacological
inhibitor
(
SB431542
)
markedly
reduced
VEGF
release
by
HFL-1
in
response
to
CSE
and
this
effect
was
confirmed
by
TβR1
siRNA
.

In
contrast
,
nicotine
inhibited
VEGF
release
by
HFL-1
in
a
dose
and
time
dependent
manner
.

Our
findings
indicate
that
CSE
stimulates
Smad3-mediated
VEGF
release
by
lung
fibroblasts
.

Nicotine
does
not
account
for
the
CSE
stimulation
of
VEGF
in
HFL-1
.

The
ability
of
lung
fibroblasts
to
produce
VEGF
may
play
a
role
in
pathogenesis
of
cigarette
smoke
induced
lung
disease

four
isomers
that
exhibit
direct

indirect
effects
on
both

The
Hedgehog
(
Hh
)
pathway
is
a
developmental
signaling
pathway
involved
in
numerous
developmental
processes
,
including
determination
of
cell
fate
,
patterning
,
proliferation
,
survival
,
and
differentiation
.

While
this
pathway
is
silenced
in
most
adult
tissues
,
aberrant
activation
of
it
has
been
documented
in
a
variety
of
malignancies
.

In
cancers
such
as
basal
cell
carcinoma
(
BCC
)
,
ligand-independent
mechanisms
lead
to
constitutive
Hh
pathway
activation
through
mutations
in
components
of
the
pathway
,
including
patched-1
(
PTCH1
)
or
smoothened
(
SMO
)
.

On
the
contrary
,
numerous
other
solid
and
hematologic
tumors
have
been
shown
to
harbor
ligand-dependent
activation
of
the
Hh
pathway
by
autocrine
or
paracrine
mechanisms
.

Given
that
aberrant
Hh
pathway
signaling
has
been
seen
in
a
number
of
malignancies
,
this
pathway
has
been
an
attractive
target
for
drug
development
.

While
the
best-characterized
approach
is
to
target
the
SMO
receptor
,
other
rational
approaches
for
inhibiting
the
Hh
pathway
include
inhibiting
downstream
components
or
directly
binding
Hh
ligands
.

In
January
of
2012
,
vismodegib
,
a
SMO
antagonist
,
became
the
first
agent
to
target
the
Hh
pathway
to
receive
approval
by
the
United
States
Food
and
Drug
Administration
(
FDA
)
after
this
agent
showed
remarkable
activity
in
phase
I
and
II
trials
for
the
treatment
of
BCC
.

Despite
promising
preclinical
studies
with
Hh
pathway
inhibitors
in
other
malignancies
that
have
suggested
a
potential
role
for
these
agents
,
attempts
to
translate
this
potential
to
clinical
benefit
has
been
disappointing
.

Future
efforts
will
require
further
careful
interpretation
and
analysis
to
determine
the
potential
determinants
and
predictors
of
efficacy
.

,
and

was
less
frequent
(
8%

Degradation
of

Thalidomide
is
an
antiangiogenic
drug
and
is
clinically
useful
in
a
number
of
cancers
.

However
,
the
molecular
mechanism
by
which
thalidomide
exerts
its
antitumor
effects
is
poorly
understood
.

This
study
was
designed
to
clarify
the
relationship
between
antiangiogenesis
and
antitumor
effects
of
thalidomide
and
to
explore
the
molecular

the
effects
of
thalidomide
on
the

expressing
(

not

,

Thalidomide
could
inhibit

In

we
found
that
thalidomide

it
exerted
antitumor

on

The

One
of
the

is
adiponectin

acts

We
have
studied
the
CREB-ATF-adiponectin

From

Activation
of
CREB
was
accompanied
by
subsequent
reduction

Under

,
we
found
that
a

recoupled
pair
bond
-
accounts
for
the
ability
of
these
elements
to
form
hypervalent

compounds
.

Hypervalent
molecules
are
formed
when
it
is
energetically
favorable
for
the

in

to
be
recoupled
,
allowing
each
of
the

to
form
chemical

with

.

In

,
we
characterize
the

of
the

,

compare
our

Both
the

oscillate

variations
that
are
readily
explained
using

Comparisons
are
drawn
between
the
ClFn

cations
and
their

in
the

,
which
possess
many
similarities
.

We
found
two
significant
differences
between
the
ClFn
(

and
SFn
series
:
(
i
)
the
bond
dissociation
energies
of
ClFn
(

are
much
weaker
than
those
of
the
corresponding

A2

in

(

corresponding
to
the

Examination
of
the
Mulliken
populations
at
the
HF

AVTZ
level
for
ClFn
(

and
SFn
species
predicts
that
the
F
atom
in
the
axial
(
recoupled
pair
bonding
)
position
is
more
highly
charged
than
the
F
atom
in
the

position;
there
is
also
less
change
transfer
to
the
F
atoms
in
ClFn
(

than
in
SFn
.

The
positive
charge
on
Cl
(

)
makes
it
more
difficult
for
an
F
atom
to
attract
electrons
from
Cl
(

than
from
S
and
correspondingly
less
favorable
to

Several
studies
have
shown
that
the
activities
of
delta-6-desaturase
and
delta-5-desaturase
are
depressed
in
experimental
diabetes
and
in
humans
with
insulin-
and
non-insulin-dependent
diabetes
mellitus
(
type
I
and
type
II
diabetes
mellitus
respectively
)
.

Furthermore
,
treatment
with
insulin
is
known
to
correct
the
defects
in
desaturases
in
rats
and
humans
with
diabetes
,
especially
in
type
I
.

In
a
recent
study
,
we
demonstrated
that
L-arginine
and
nitric
oxide
can
prevent
alloxan-induced
beta
cell
damage
,
and
the
severity
of
diabetes
,
and
restore
the
antioxidant
status
to
near
normal
levels
.

But
,
no
information
is
available
as
to
the
relationship
between
L-arginine-nitric
oxide
system
and
the
metabolism
of
essential
fatty
acids
in
diabetes
mellitus
.

In
the
present
study
,
it
was
noted
that
the
plasma
levels
of
saturated
fatty
acids
:
stearic
and
palmitic
were
increased
where
as
unsaturated
fatty
acids
such
as
oleic
,
linoleic
,
gamma-linolenic
and
eicosapentaenoic
acids
(
OA
,
LA
,
GLA
and
EPA
respectively
)
were
decreased
in
alloxan-induced
diabetic
rats
.

In
the
liver
phospholipid
(
PL
)
fraction
,
GLA
,
DGLA
(
dihomo-GLA
)
and
alpha-linolenic
acid
(
ALA
)
were
decreased
in
the
alloxan-treated
group;
in
the
muscle
PL
fraction
,
LA
,
GLA
and
DGLA
were
low
,
whereas
an
increase
in
the
saturated
fatty
acid
content
was
noted
.

L-arginine
(
the
precursor
of
nitric
oxide
)
and
sodium
nitroprusside
(
a
nitric
oxide
donor
)
treatment
of
alloxan-induced
diabetic
rats
enhanced
the
levels
of
LA
,
GLA
and
DGLA
.

Further
,
nitric
oxide
synthase
inhibitor
,
L-NMMA
,
prevented
this
beneficial
action
of
L-arginine-nitric
oxide
system
on
essential
fatty
acid
metabolism
.

The
abnormalities
in
the
essential
fatty
acid
metabolism
observed
also
reverted
to
normalcy
following
control
of
diabetes
with
insulin
.

These
results
indicate
that
nitric
oxide
can
enhance
the
activities
of
delta-6-
and
delta-5
desaturases
,
which
are
depressed
in
diabetes
,
and
suggests
that
there
is
a
close
interaction
between
L-arginine-nitric
oxide
system
and
the
metabolism
of
essential
fatty
acids
.

Electrophilic
chemicals
activate
both
insect
and
vertebrate
TRPA1
via
covalent
modification
of
cysteine
residues
in
the
amino-terminal
region
.

Although
naturally
occurring
electrophilic
plant
compounds
,
such
as
mustard
oil
and
cinnamaldehyde
,
are
TRPA1
agonists
,
it
is
unknown
whether
arthropod-produced
electrophiles
activate
mammalian
TRPA1
.

We
characterized
the
effects
of
the
electrophilic
arthropod
defensive
compound
para-benzoquinone
(
pBQN
)
on
the
human
TRPA1
channel
.

We
used
whole-cell
recordings
of
human
embryonic
kidney
cells
heterologously
expressing
either
wild-type
TRPA1
or
TRPA1
with
three
serine-substituted
cysteines
crucial
for
electrophile
activation
(
C621S
,
C641S
,
C665S
)
.

We
found
that
pBQN
activates
TRPA1
starting
at
10
nM
and
peaking
at
300
nM;
higher
concentrations
caused
rapid
activation
followed
by
a
fast
decline
.

Activation
by
pBQN
required
reactivity
with
cysteine
residues
,
but
ones
that
are
distinct
from
those
previously
reported
to
be
the
key
targets
of
electrophiles
.

The
current
reduction
we
found
at
higher
pBQN
concentrations
was
a
cysteine-dependent
desensitization
of
TRPA1
,
and
did
not
require
prior
activation
.

The
cysteines
required
for
desensitization
are
not
accessible
to
all
electrophiles
as
iodoacetamide
and
internally
applied
2-
(
trimethylammonium
)
ethyl
methanesulfonate
failed
to
cause
desensitization
(
despite
large
activation
)
.

Interestingly
,
following
pBQN
desensitization
,
wild-type
TRPA1
had
dramatically
reduced
response
to
the
nonelectrophile
agonist
carvacrol
,
whereas
the
triple
cysteine
mutant
TRPA1
retained
its
full
response
.

Our
results
suggest
that
modification
of
multiple
cysteine
residues
by
electrophilic
compounds
can
generate
both
activation
and
desensitization
of
the
TRPA1
channel
.
Polybrominated

that
have
been

to
disrupt

both
in

in

The
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
determine
the
precise
organ
and
tissue
locations
that
express
genes
critical
to
thyroid
hormone
regulation
in
developing
zebrafish
(
Danio

)
,
and
to
determine
the
effects
of
an
OH-BDE
on
their
expression
.

While
RT-PCR
can
provide
quantitative
data
on
gene
expression
,
it
lacks
spatial
sensitivity
to
examine
localized
gene
expression;
and
,
isolation
of
organs
from
zebrafish
embryos
is
technically
difficult
,
if
not
impossible
.

For
this
reason
,
the
present
study
used
whole
mount
in

hybridization
to
simultaneously
localize
and
quantify
gene
expression
in
vivo
.

While
PBDEs
and
OH-BDEs
have
been
shown
to
inhibit
the
activity
and
expression
of
deiodionases
,
a
family
of
enzymes
that
regulate
thyroid
hormone
concentrations
intracellularly
,
it
is
unclear
whether
or
not
they
can
affect
regional
expression
of
the
different
isoforms
during
early
development
.

In
this
study
we
investigated
deiodinase

,
and

)
in
zebrafish
and
found
life
stage

of
these
genes
that
were
highly
localized
.

To
demonstrate
the
use
of
this
technique
for
investigating
potential
endocrine
disrupting
effects
,
zebrafish
embryos
were
exposed
to

.

Significant

of

and

,
respectively
(
quantified
by
measuring

were
observed
,

ATPase
II
)
,
originally
isolated
from
bovine
secretory
vesicles
,
is
a
member
of
this
subfamily
based
on
sequence
homology
to
the
founding
member
of
the
subfamily
,
the
yeast
protein
Drs2
,
which
has
been
linked
to
ribosomal
assembly
,
the
formation
of
Golgi-coated
vesicles
,
and
the
maintenance
of
PS
asymmetry
.

To
determine
if
ATP8A1
has
biochemical
characteristics
consistent
with
a
PS
flippase
,
a
murine
homologue
of
this
enzyme
was
expressed
in
insect
cells
and
purified
.

The
purified
Atp8a1
is
inactive
in
detergent
micelles
or
in
micelles
containing
phosphatidylcholine
,
phosphatidic
acid
,
or
phosphatidylinositol
,
is
minimally
activated
by
phosphatidylglycerol
or
phosphatidylethanolamine
(
PE
)
,
and
is
maximally
activated
by
PS
.

The
selectivity
for
PS
is
dependent
upon
multiple
elements
of
the
lipid
structure
.

Similar
to
the
plasma
membrane
PS
transporter
,
Atp8a1
is
activated
only
by
the
naturally
occurring
sn-1
,
2-glycerol
isomer
of
PS
and
not
the
sn-2
,
3-glycerol
stereoisomer
.

Both
flippase
and
Atp8a1
activities
are
insensitive
to
the
stereochemistry
of
the
serine
headgroup
.

Most
modifications
of
the
PS
headgroup
structure
decrease
recognition
by
the
plasma
membrane
PS
flippase
.

Activation
of
Atp8a1
is
also
reduced
by
these
modifications;
phosphatidylserine-O-methyl
ester
,
lysophosphatidylserine
,
glycerophosphoserine
,
and
phosphoserine
,
which
are
not
transported
by
the
plasma
membrane
flippase
,
do
not
activate
Atp8a1
.

Weakly
translocated
lipids
(
PE
,
phosphatidylhydroxypropionate
,
and
phosphatidylhomoserine
)
are
also
weak
Atp8a1
activators
.

However
,
N-methyl-phosphatidylserine
,
which
is
transported
by
the
plasma
membrane
flippase
at
a
rate
equivalent
to
PS
,
is
incapable
of
activating
Atp8a1
activity
.

These
results
indicate
that
the
ATPase
activity
of
the
secretory
granule
Atp8a1
is
activated
by
phospholipids
binding
to
a
specific
site
whose
properties
(
PS
selectivity
,
dependence
upon
glycerol
but
not
serine
,
stereochemistry
,
and
vanadate
sensitivity
)
are
similar
to
,
but
distinct
from
,
the
properties
of
the
substrate
binding
site
of
the
plasma
membrane
flippase
.
While
putative
disease-preventing
lycopene
metabolites
are
found
in
both
tomato
(
Solanum
lycopersicum
)
products
and
in
their
consumers
,
mammalian
lycopene
metabolism
is
poorly
understood
.

Advances
in
tomato
cell
culturing
techniques
offer
an
economical
tool
for
generation
of
highly-enriched
(
13
)
C-lycopene
for
human
bioavailability
and
metabolism
studies
.

To
enhance
the
(
13
)
C-enrichment
and
yields
of
labelled
lycopene
from
the
hp-1
tomato
cell
line
,
cultures
were
first
grown
in
(
13
)
C-glucose
media
for
three
serial
batches
and
produced
increasing
proportions
of
uniformly
labelled
lycopene
(

and

5%
)
with
consistent
yields
(
from

.
8
to
9mg
/
L
)
.

An
optimised
9-day-long
(
13
)
C-loading
and
18-day-long
labelling
strategy
developed
based
on
glucose
utilisation
and
lycopene
yields
,
yielded
(
13
)
C-lycopene
with
93%
(
13
)
C
isotopic
purity
,
and
55%
of
isotopomers
were
uniformly
labelled
.

Furthermore
,
an
optimised
acetone
and
hexane
extraction
led
to
a
fourfold
increase
in
lycopene
recovery
from
cultures
compared
to
a
standard
extraction
.
Hepatotoxicity
remains
a
major
challenge
in
drug
development
.

Although
alanine
aminotransferase
(
ALT
)
remains
the
gold
standard
biomarker
of
liver
injury
,
alternative
biomarker
strategies
to
better
predict
the
potential
for
severe
drug-induced
liver
injury
(
DILI
)
are
essential
.

In
this
study
,
we
evaluated
the
utility
of
glutamate
dehydrogenase
(
GLDH
)
,
purine
nucleoside
phosphorylase
(
PNP
)
,
malate
dehydrogenase
(
MDH
)
,
and
paraxonase
1
(
PON1
)
as
indicators
of
liver
injury
in
cohorts
of
human
subjects
,
including
healthy
subjects
across
age
and
gender
,
subjects
with
a
variety
of
liver
impairments
,
and
several
cases
of
acetaminophen
poisoning
.

In
the
healthy
subjects
,
levels
of
GLDH
and
MDH
were
not
affected
by
age
or
gender
.

Reference
ranges
for
GLDH
and
MDH
in
healthy
subjects
were
1-10
and
79-176U
/
L
,
respectively
.

In
contrast
,
the
levels
of
PON1
and
PNP
were
not
consistent
across
cohorts
of
healthy
subjects
.

Furthermore
,
GLDH
and
MDH
had
a
strong
correlation
with
elevated
ALT
levels
and
possessed
a
high
predictive
power
for
liver
injury
,
as
determined
by
ROC
analysis
.

In
contrast
,
PON1
and
PNP
did
not
detect
liver
injury
in
our
study
.

Finally
,
evaluation
of
patients
with
acetaminophen-induced
liver
injury
provided
evidence
that
both
GLDH
and
MDH
might
have
utility
as
biomarkers
of
DILI
in
humans
.

This
study
is
the
first
to
evaluate
GLDH
,
MDH
,
PON1
,
and
PNP
in
a
large
number
of
human
subjects
and
,
and
it
provides
an
impetus
for
prospective
clinical
studies
to
fully
evaluate
the
diagnostic
value
of
GLDH
and
MDH
for
detection
of
liver
injury
.
Acetaminophen
is
cleared
primarily
by
hepatic
glucuronidation
.

Polymorphisms
in
genes
encoding
the
acetaminophen
UDP-glucuronosyltransferase
(
UGT
)
enzymes
could
explain
interindividual
variability
in
acetaminophen
glucuronidation
and
variable
risk
for
liver
injury
after
acetaminophen
overdose
.

In
this
study
,
human
liver
bank
samples
were
phenotyped
for
acetaminophen
glucuronidation
activity
and
genotyped
for
the
major
acetaminophen-glucuronidating
enzymes
(
UGTs
1A1
,
1A6
,
1A9
,
and
2B15
)
.

Of
these
,
only
three
linked
single
nucleotide
polymorphisms
(
SNPs
)
located
in
the
shared
UGT1A-3'UTR
region
(
rs10929303
,
rs1042640
,
rs8330
)
were
associated
with
acetaminophen
glucuronidation
activity
,
with
rs8330
consistently
showing
higher
acetaminophen
glucuronidation
at
all
the
tested
concentrations
of
acetaminophen
.

Mechanistic
studies
using
luciferase-UGT1A-3'UTR
reporters
indicated
that
these
SNPs
do
not
alter
mRNA
stability
or
translation
efficiency
.

However
,
there
was
evidence
for
allelic
imbalance
and
a
gene-dose
proportional
increase
in
the
amount
of
exon
5a
versus
exon
5b
containing
UGT1A
mRNA
spliced
transcripts
in
livers
with
the
rs8330
variant
allele
.

Cotransfection
studies
demonstrated
an
inhibitory
effect
of
exon
5b
containing
cDNAs
on
acetaminophen
glucuronidation
by
UGT1A1
and
UGT1A6
cDNAs
containing
exon
5a
.

In
silico
analysis
predicted
that
rs8330
creates
an
exon
splice
enhancer
site
that
could
favor
exon
5a
(
over
exon
5b
)
utilization
during
splicing
.

Finally
,
the
prevalence
of
rs8330
was
significantly
lower
(

unintentional
acetaminophen
overdose
compared
with
patients
with
acute
liver
failure
from
other
causes
or
a
race-
or
ethnicity-matched
population
.

Together
,
these
findings
suggest
that
rs8330
is
an
important
determinant
of
acetaminophen
glucuronidation
and
could
affect
an
individual's
risk
for
acetaminophen-induced
liver
injury

The
aim
of
our
study
was
to
investigate
the
mechanisms
by
which
rhubarb
regulates

Our
results
revealed

inhibited

in
a

Rhubarb
also
reduced

downregulated

Additionally
,
rhubarb
inhibited
β-catenin
nuclear
accumulation
and
induced
its
degradation
via
proteasome-mediated
pathway
.

Furthermore
,
we
found
that
rhubarb
suppressed
the
p-ser
(

)
GSK-3-β
protein
level
to
inactivate
Wnt
signalling
and
reduce

Taken
together;
we
found
that
rhubarb
blocked

mediated
through
GSK-3-β
activation
,

Progress

provides
us
with
the

Keratinocytes

We
have

a
potentially
useful

The
aim
of
the
present
article
is
to

Cytokine-inducible
nitric
oxide
synthase
(
iNOS
)
is
a
homodimeric
enzyme
that
generates
nitric
oxide
(
NO
)
and
L-citrulline
from
L-arginine
(
L-Arg
)
and
O2
.

The
N-terminal
oxygenase
domain
(
amino
acids
1-498;
iNOSox
)
in
each
subunit
binds
heme
,
L-Arg
,
and
tetrahydrobiopterin
(
H4B
)
,
is
the
site
of
NO
synthesis
,
and
is
responsible
for
the
dimeric
interaction
,
which
must
occur
to
synthesize
NO
.

In
both
cells
and
purified
systems
,
iNOS
dimer
assembly
is
promoted
by
H4B
,
L-Arg
,
and
L-Arg
analogs
.

We
examined
the
ability
of
imidazole
and
N-substituted
imidazoles
to
promote
or
inhibit
dimerization
of
heme-containing
iNOSox
monomers
,
or
to
affect
iNOS
dimerization
in
cells
.

Imidazole
,
1-phenylimidazole
,
clotrimazole
,
and
miconazole
all
bound
to
the
iNOSox
monomer
heme
iron
.

Imidazole
and
1-phenylimidazole
promoted
iNOSox
dimerization
,
whereas
clotrimazole
(
30
microM
)
and
miconazole
(
15
microM
)
did
not
,
and
instead
inhibited
dimerization
normally
promoted
by
L-Arg
and
H4B
.

Clotrimazole
also
bound
to
iNOSox
dimers
in
the
absence
of
L-Arg
and
H4B
and
caused
their
dissociation
.

When
added
to
cells
expressing
iNOS
,
clotrimazole
(
50
microM
)
had
no
effect
on
iNOS
protein
expression
but
almost
completely
inhibited
its
dimerization
and
consequent
NO
synthesis
over
an
8-h
culture
period
,
without
affecting
calmodulin
interaction
with
iNOS
.

Thus
,
imidazoles
can
promote
or
inhibit
dimerization
of
iNOS
both
in
vitro
and
in
cells
,
depending
on
their
structure
.

Bulky
imidazoles
like
clotrimazole
block
NO
synthesis
by
inhibiting
assembly
of
the
iNOS
dimer
,
revealing
a
new
means
to
control
cellular
NO
synthesis
.
Adenosine
modulates
a
variety
of
physiological
functions
through
interaction
with
A1
and
A2
adenosine
receptors
,
where
agonists
mediate
inhibition
and
stimulation
,
respectively
,
of
adenylate
cyclase
.

In
the
cardiovascular
system
,
A2
receptors
mediate
vasodilation
and
reduction
in
blood
pressure
,
while
A1
receptors
mediate
cardiac
depression
.

The
involvement
of
adenylate
cyclase
in
these
responses
remains
unresolved
.

Adenosine
analogs
in
particular
the
N6-substituted
compounds
are
more
potent
at
A1
receptors
than
at
A2
receptors
.

The
subregion
of
the
adenosine
receptor
that
interacts
with
the
N6-substituent
is
different
for
A1
and
A2
receptors
,
particularly
with
respect
to
phenyl
interactions
,
bulk
tolerance
and
stereoselectivity
.

A
series
of
para-substituted
N6-phenyladenosines
have
been
synthesized
based
on
a
"functionalized
congener"
approach
in
which
a
chemically
reactive
group
,
such
as
an
amine
or
carboxylic
acid
,
is
introduced
at
the
terminus
of
a
chain
.

From
the
"functionalized
congener"
are
synthesized
a
variety
of
conjugates
each
containing
a
common
pharmacophore
.

Certain
of
the
adenosine
conjugates
are
highly
selective
for
A1
receptors
.

Xanthines
are
classical
antagonists
for
adenosine
receptors
for
many
of
their
pharmacological
actions
may
be
due
to
blockade
of
adenosine
receptors
.

Caffeine
and
theophylline
are
virtually
non-selective
for
A2
and
A2
receptors
.

Replacement
of
the
methyl
groups
of
theophylline
with
n-propyl
or
larger
alkyl
groups
yields
xanthines
with
selectivity
for
A1
receptors
,
particularly
when
combined
with
an
8-phenyl
moiety
.

Most
1
,
3-dialkyl-8-phenyl
xanthines
are
very
insoluble
,
but
incorporation
of
polar
aryl
substituents
,
such
as
sulfo
or
carboxy
to
increase
solubility
,
results
in
marked
reduction
in
potency
and
selectivity
.

A
new
series
of
more
hydrophilic
1
,
3-dipropyl-8-phenylxanthines
has
been
synthesized
using
the
"functionalized
congener"
approach
.

Certain
conjugates
of
8-
[
4-
(
carboxymethyloxy
)
phenyl
1
]
1
,
3-dipropylxanthine
display
A1
selectivity
in
biochemical
and
cardiovascular
models
.

Certain
analogs
of
caffeine
in
which
the
methyl
group
at
the
1-
or
7-position
is
replaced
with
a
propargyl
or
propyl
group
display
selectivity
for
A2
receptors
.

The
profile
of
a
series
of
adenosine
analogs
or
of
xanthine
antagonists
can
be
used
to
define
the
nature
of
adenosine
receptors

We

In

However
,
69%

AhR-dependent
reporter
gene
expression
in
transfected

cells
was
increased
by
pelargonidin
in
a
concentration-dependent
manner
at
24h
.

Similarly
,
pelargonidin
induced
the
expression
of
CYP1A1

in

CYP1A1

were
also
increased
by
pelargonidin
in
three
primary
human
hepatocytes
cultures
(
approximately
5%
of
TCDD
potency
)
and
the
increase
in
CYP1A1
protein
in
HepG2
and
LS174T
cells
was
comparable
to
the
increase
in
catalytic
activity
of
CYP1A1
enzyme
.

Ligand

demonstrated
that
pelargonidin
was
a
weak
ligand
of
AhR

Enzyme
kinetic

using

revealed

activity
by
delphinidin
(

and

)
.

Overall
,
although
most
anthocyanidins
had
no
effects
on
AhR-CYP1A1
signaling
,
pelargonidin
can
bind
to
and
activate
the
AhR

AhR-dependent

,
and
pelargonidin
and
delphinidin
inhibit
the

The

to

in

All

,
GAL
(
10
microM
)
and
HPA
(
0

1
microM
)
to
the
superfusion
medium
decreased
the
release
of
the
ACh
neurotransmitter
to
a
similar
extent
:
36%
,
30%
and
34%
,
respectively
(
P<0
.
01
)
.

This
effect
was
reverted
in
the
presence
of
atropine
(
ATR;
0
.
1
microM
)
,
which
blocks
the
pre-synaptic
muscarinic
M2
receptor
.

After
that
,
a
wide
range
of
concentrations
of
drugs
,
concomitantly
with
ATR
(
0

1
microM
)
,
was
studied
in
the
presence
of
haloperidol
(
HAL;
0
.
01

)
,
a
dopamine
D2
antagonist
.

In
these
conditions
,
a
dose-dependent
increase
of
[
3H
]
-ACh
release
was
observed
in
the
presence
of
(
+
/

)
-HX
,
GAL
and
HPA
.

To
test
the
role
of
nicotinic
receptors
in
the
drugs'
effects
on
[
3H
]
-ACh
release
,
mecamylamine
(
MEC
)
100
microM
was
used
to
block
such
receptors
.

MEC
alone
significantly
decreased
neurotransmitter
release
by
18%
(
P<0
.
05
)
,
but
no
change
was
obtained
in
the
presence
of
both
ATR
and
MEC
.

Under
these
conditions
,
(
+
/
-
)
-HX
,
GAL
and
HPA
increased
the
release
of
[
3H
]
-ACh
by
37%
,
25%
and
38%
,
respectively
(
P<0
.
01
)
.

Taking
into
account
all
of
these
data
,
the
present
results
suggest
that
the
effects
induced
by
(
+
/
-
)
-HX
and
GAL
nicotinic-receptor
potentiators
seem
to
be
mainly
due
to
their
ability
in
inhibiting
acetylcholinesterase
activity
,
but
not
by
interaction
on
the
nicotinic
receptors
.
In
the
late
1980s
vinclozolin
was
tested
for
prenatal
developmental
toxicity
in
rats
for
registration
purposes
in
USA
.

At
1000mg
/
kgbw
,
95%
of
all
fetuses
were
female
upon
visual
inspection
(
ano-genital
distance
determination
)
.

Anti-androgenic
effects
(
AA
)
were
also
noted
in
a
subsequent
2-generation
study
.

These
findings
triggered
mechanistic
investigations
at
BASF
and
at
US-EPA
.

Results
published
by
the
latter
were
the
starting
point
of
the
endocrine
disruption
(
ED
)
discussion
in
the
1990s
.

AA
effects
of
vinclozolin
are
mediated
by
two
metabolites
,
which
have
an
antagonistic
effect
on
the
androgen
receptor
.

Currently
,
determination
of
ED
has
become
a
major
end-point
in
toxicology
testing
and
the
US-EPA
has
set
up
an
elaborated
testing
paradigm
to
fulfill
this
requirement
.

Future
screening
for
ED
can
be
improved
making
use
of
new
technologies
.

can
be
determined
by

BACKGROUND
&
AIMS
:
Of
the
2
genes
(
MAT1A
,
MAT2A
)
encoding
methionine
adenosyltransferase
,
the
enzyme
that
synthesizes
S-adenosylmethionine
,
MAT1A
,
is
expressed
in
liver
,
whereas
MAT2A
is
expressed
in
extrahepatic
tissues
.

In
liver
,
MAT2A
expression
associates
with
growth
,
dedifferentiation
,
and
cancer
.

Here
,
we
identified
the
beta
subunit
as
a
regulator
of
proliferation
in
human
hepatoma
cell
lines
.

The
beta
subunit
has
been
cloned
and
shown
to
lower
the
K
(
m
)
of
methionine
adenosyltransferase
II
alpha2
(
the
MAT2A
product
)
for
methionine
and
to
render
the
enzyme
more
susceptible
to
S-adenosylmethionine
inhibition
.

METHODS
:
Methionine
adenosyltransferase
II
alpha2
and
beta
subunit
expression
was
analyzed
in
human
and
rat
liver
and
hepatoma
cell
lines
and
their
interaction
studied
in
HuH7
cells
.

beta
Subunit
expression
was
up-
and
down-regulated
in
human
hepatoma
cell
lines
and
the
effect
on
DNA
synthesis
determined
.

RESULTS
:
We
found
that
beta
subunit
is
expressed
in
rat
extrahepatic
tissues
but
not
in
normal
liver
.

In
human
liver
,
beta
subunit
expression
associates
with
cirrhosis
and
hepatoma
.

beta
Subunit
is
expressed
in
most
(
HepG2
,
PLC
,
and
Hep3B
)
but
not
all
(
HuH7
)
hepatoma
cell
lines
.

Transfection
of
beta
subunit
reduced
S-adenosylmethionine
content
and
stimulated
DNA
synthesis
in
HuH7
cells
,
whereas
down-regulation
of
beta
subunit
expression
diminished
DNA
synthesis
in
HepG2
.

The
interaction
between
methionine
adenosyltransferase
II
alpha2
and
beta
subunit
was
demonstrated
in
HuH7
cells
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
Our
findings
indicate
that
beta
subunit
associates
with
cirrhosis
and
cancer
providing
a
proliferative
advantage
in
hepatoma
cells
through
its
interaction
with
methionine
adenosyltransferase
II
alpha2
and
down-regulation
of
S-adenosylmethionine
levels
.

A
deficit
in
zinc
(
Zn
)
availability
can
increase
cell
oxidant
production
,
affect
the
antioxidant
defense
system
,
and
trigger
oxidant-sensitive
signals
in
neuronal
cells
.

This
work
tested
the
hypothesis
that
a
decreased
Zn
availability
can
affect
glutathione
(
GSH
)
metabolism
in
the
developing
rat
brain
and
in
neuronal
cells
in
culture
,
as
well
as
the
capacity
of
human
neuroblastoma
IMR-32
cells
to
upregulate
GSH
when
challenged
with
dopamine
(
DA
)
.

GSH
levels
were
low
in
the
brain
of
gestation
day
19
(
GD19
)
fetuses
from
dams
fed
marginal
Zn
diets
throughout
gestation
and
in
Zn-deficient
IMR-32
cells
.

γ-Glutamylcysteine
synthetase
(
GCL
)
,
the
first
enzyme
in
the
GSH
synthetic
pathway
,
was
altered
by
Zn
deficiency
(
ZD
)
.

The
protein
and
mRNA
levels
of
the
GCL
modifier
(
GCLM
)
and
catalytic
(
GCLC
)
subunits
were
lower
in
the
Zn-deficient
GD19
fetal
brain
and
in
IMR-32
cells
compared
with
controls
.

The
nuclear
translocation
of
transcription
factor
nuclear
factor
(
erythroid-derived
2
)
-like
2
,
which
controls
GCL
transcription
,
was
impaired
by
ZD
.

Posttranslationally
,
the
caspase-3-dependent
GCLC
cleavage
was
high
in
Zn-deficient
IMR-32
cells
.

Cells
challenged
with
DA
showed
an
increase
in
GCLM
and
GCLC
protein
and
mRNA
levels
and
a
consequent
increase
in
GSH
concentration
.

Although
Zn-deficient
cells
partially
upregulated
GCL
subunits
after
exposure
to
DA
,
GSH
content
remained
low
.

In
summary
,
results
show
that
a
low
Zn
availability
affects
the
GSH
synthetic
pathway
in
neuronal
cells
and
fetal
brain
both
at
transcriptional
and
posttranslational
levels
.

This
can
in
part
underlie
the
GSH
depletion
associated
with
ZD
and
the
high
sensitivity
of
Zn-deficient
neurons
to
pro-oxidative
stressors
.

Ingenol
3-angelate
(
I3A
)
is
one
of
the
active
ingredients
in
Euphorbia
peplus
,
which
has
been
used
in
traditional
medicine
.

Here
,
we
report
the
initial
characterization
of
I3A
as
a
protein
kinase
C
(
PKC
)
ligand
.

I3A
bound
to
PKC-alpha
in
the
presence
of
phosphatidylserine
with
high
affinity;
however
,
under
these
assay
conditions
,
little
PKC
isoform
selectivity
was
observed
.

PKC
isoforms
did
show
different
sensitivity
and
selectivity
for
down-regulation
by
I3A
and
phorbol
12-myristate
13-acetate
(
PMA
)
in
WEHI-231
,
HOP-92
,
and
Colo-205
cells
.

In
all
of
the
three
cell
types
,
I3A
inhibited
cell
proliferation
with
somewhat
lower
potency
than
did
PMA
.

In
intact
CHO-K1
cells
,
I3A
was
able
to
translocate
different
green
fluorescent
protein-tagged
PKC
isoforms
,
visualized
by
confocal
microscopy
,
with
equal
or
higher
potency
than
PMA
.

PKC-delta
in
particular
showed
a
different
pattern
of
translocation
in
response
to
I3A
and
PMA
.

I3A
induced
a
higher
level
of
secretion
of
the
inflammatory
cytokine
interleukin
6
compared
with
PMA
in
the
WEHI-231
cells
and
displayed
a
marked
biphasic
dose-response
curve
for
the
induction
.

I3A
was
unable
to
cause
the
same
extent
of
association
of
the
C1b
domain
of
PKC-delta
with
lipids
,
compared
with
PMA
or
the
physiological
regulator
diacylglycerol
,
and
was
able
to
partially
block
the
association
induced
by
these
agents
,
measured
by
surface
plasmon
resonance
.

The
in
vitro
kinase
activity
of
PKC-alpha
induced
by
I3A
was
lower
than
that
induced
by
PMA
.

The
novel
pattern
of
behavior
of
I3A
makes
it
of
great
interest
for
further
evaluation

concomitant
with
an
increase
in
TORC1
and
TORC2
activity
.

Sustained
TGFβ
activation
was
required
to
inhibit
association
of
deptor
with
mTOR
,
whereas
rapid
activation
had
no
effect
.

Using
the
mTOR
inhibitor
PP242
,
we
found
that
TGFβ-induced
both
early
and
sustained
activation
of
TORC1
and
TORC2
was
necessary
for
deptor
suppression
.

PP242-induced
reversal
of
deptor
suppression
by
TGFβ
was
associated
with
a
significant
inhibition
of
TGFβ-stimulated
protein
synthesis
and
hypertrophy
.

Interestingly
,
expression
of
siRNA
against
Smad
3
or
Smad
7
,
which
blocks
TGFβ
receptor-specific
Smad
3
signaling
,
prevented
TGFβ-induced
suppression
of
deptor
abundance
and
TORC1
/
2
activities
.

Furthermore
,
overexpression
of
Smad
3
decreased
deptor
expression
similar
to
TGFβ
stimulation
concomitant
with
increased
TORC1
and
TORC2
activities
.

Finally
,
knockdown
of
deptor
reversed
Smad
7-mediated
inhibition
of
protein
synthesis
and
mesangial
cell
hypertrophy
induced
by
TGFβ
.

These
data
reveal
the
requirement
of
both
early
and
late
activation
of
mTOR
for
TGFβ-induced
protein
synthesis
.

Our
results
support
that
TGFβ-stimulated
Smad
3
acts
as
a
key
node
to
instill
a
feedback
loop
between
deptor
down-regulation
and
TORC1
/

activation
in
driving

Utility
of
tolcapone
in
fluctuating
Parkinson's
disease
.
X-chromosomal
dystonia
parkinsonism
syndrome
(
XDP
,
'lubag'
)
is
associated
with
sequence
changes
within
the
TAF1
/
DYT3
multiple
transcript
system
.

Although
most
sequence
changes
are
intronic
,
one
,
disease-specific
single-nucleotide
change
3
(
DSC3
)
,
is
located
within
an
exon
(
d4
)
.

Transcribed
exon
d4
occurs
as
part
of
multiple
splice
variants
.

These
variants
include
exons
d3
and
d4
spliced
to
exons
of
TAF1
,
and
an
independent
transcript
composed
of
exons
d2-d4
.

Location
of
DSC3
in
exon
d4
and
utilization
of
this
exon
in
multiple
splice
variants
suggest
an
important
role
of
DSC3
in
the
XDP
pathogenesis
.

To
test
this
hypothesis
,
we
transfected
neuroblastoma
cells
with
four
expression
constructs
,
including
exons
d2-d4
[
d2-d4

wild-type
(
wt

and
d2-d4
/
DSC3
]
and
d3-d4
(
d3-d4
/
wt
and
d3-d4
/
DSC3
)
.

Expression
profiling
revealed
a
dramatic
effect
of
DSC3
on
overall
gene
expression
.

Three
hundred
and
sixty-two
genes
differed
between
cells
containing
d2-d4
/
wt
and
d2-d4
/
DSC3
.

Annotation

revealed
enrichment
of
genes
related
to
vesicular
transport
,
dopamine
metabolism
,
synapse
function
,
Ca
(
2

)
metabolism
and
oxidative
stress
.

Two
hundred
and
eleven
genes
were
differentially
expressed
in
d3-d4
/
wt
versus
d3-d4
/
DSC3
.

Annotation
clustering
highlighted
genes
in
signal
transduction
and
cell-cell
interaction
.

The
data
show
an
important
role
of
physiologically
occurring
transcript
d2-d4
in
normal
brain
function
.

Interference
with
this
role
by
DSC3
is
a
likely
pathological
mechanism
in
XDP
.

Disturbance
of
dopamine
function
and
of
Ca
(
2

)
metabolism
can
explain
abnormal
movement;
loss
of
protection
against
reactive
oxygen
species
may
account
for
the
neurodegenerative
changes
in
XDP
.

Although
d3-d4
also
affect
genes
potentially
related
to
neurodegenerative
processes
,
their
physiologic
role
as
splice

of
TAF1

The
anticonvulsant
activity
of
inhibitors
of
monoamine
oxidase
(
MAO
)
was
reported
early
after
the
development
of
irreversible
MAO
inhibitors
such
as
tranylcypromine
,
but
was
never
clinically
used
because
of
the
adverse
effects
of
these
compounds
.

The
more
recently
developed
reversible
MAO
inhibitors
with
selectivity
for
either
the
MAO-A
or
MAO-B
isoenzyme
forms
have
not
been
studied
extensively
in
animal
models
of
epilepsy
,
so
it
is
not
known
which
type
of
MAO
inhibitor
is
particularly
effective
in
this
respect
.

We
compared
the
following
drugs
in
the
kindling
model
of
epilepsy
:
1
)
L-deprenyl
(
selegiline
)
,
i
.

e
.

,
an
irreversible
inhibitor
of
MAO-B
,
which
,
however
,
also
inhibits
MAO-A
at
higher
doses
,
2
)
the
novel
reversible
MAO-B
inhibitor
LU
53439
(
3
,
4-dimethyl-7-
(
2-isopropyl-1
,
3
,
4-thiadiazol-5-yl
)
-methoxy-coumarin
)
,
which
is
much
more
selective
for
MAO-B
than
L-deprenyl
,
3
)
the
novel
reversible
and
highly
selective
MAO-A
inhibitor
LU
43839
(
esuprone;
7-hydroxy-3
,
4-dimethylcoumarin
ethanesulfonate
)
,
and
4
)
the
irreversible
nonselective
MAO
inhibitor
tranylcypromine
.

Esuprone
proved
to
be
an
effective
anticonvulsant
in
the
kindling
model
with
a
similar
potency
as
L-deprenyl
.

In
contrast
to
esuprone
and
L-deprenyl
,
the
selective
MAO-B
inhibitor
LU
53439
was
not
effective
in
the
kindling
model;
this
substantiates
the
previous
notion
that
the
anticonvulsant
activity
of
L-deprenyl
is
not
related
to
MAO-B
inhibition
,
but
to
other
effects
of
this
drug
,
such
as
inhibition
of
MAO-A
.

Drugs
inhibiting
both
MAO-A
and
MAO-B
to
a
similar
extent
(
tranylcypromine
)
or
combinations
of
selective
MAO-A
and
MAO-B
inhibitors
(
esuprone
plus
LU
53439
)
had
no
advantage
over
MAO-A
inhibition
alone
,
but
were
less
well
tolerated
.

The
data
thus
suggest
that
selective
MAO-A
inhibitors
such
as
esuprone
may
be
an
interesting
new
approach
for
the
treatment
of
epilepsy
.
The
selective
norepinephrine
(
NE
)
transporter
inhibitor
atomoxetine
(
formerly
called
tomoxetine
or
LY139603
)
has
been
shown
to
alleviate
symptoms
in
Attention
Deficit
/
Hyperactivity
Disorder
(
ADHD
)
.

We
investigated
the
mechanism
of
action
of
atomoxetine
in
ADHD
by
evaluating
the
interaction
of
atomoxetine
with
monoamine
transporters
,
the
effects
on
extracellular
levels
of
monoamines
,
and
the
expression
of
the
neuronal
activity
marker
Fos
in
brain
regions
.

Atomoxetine
inhibited
binding
of
radioligands
to
clonal
cell
lines
transfected
with
human
NE
,
serotonin
(
5-HT
)
and
dopamine
(
DA
)
transporters
with
dissociation
constants
(
K
(
i
)
)
values
of
5
,
77
and
1451
nM
,
respectively
,
demonstrating
selectivity
for
NE
transporters
.

In
microdialysis
studies
,
atomoxetine
increased
extracellular
(
EX
)
levels
of
NE
in
prefrontal
cortex
(
PFC
)
3-fold
,
but
did
not
alter
5-HT
(
EX
)
levels
.

Atomoxetine
also
increased
DA
(
EX
)
concentrations
in
PFC
3-fold
,
but
did
not
alter
DA
(
EX
)
in
striatum
or
nucleus
accumbens
.

In
contrast
,
the
psychostimulant
methylphenidate
,
which
is
used
in
ADHD
therapy
,
increased
NE
(
EX
)
and
DA
(
EX
)
equally
in
PFC
,
but
also
increased
DA
(
EX
)
in
the
striatum
and
nucleus
accumbens
to
the
same
level
.

The
expression
of
the
neuronal
activity
marker
Fos
was
increased
3
.
7-fold
in
PFC
by
atomoxetine
administration
,
but
was
not
increased
in
the
striatum
or
nucleus
accumbens
,
consistent
with
the
regional
distribution
of
increased
DA
(
EX
)
.

We
hypothesize
that
the
atomoxetine-induced
increase
of
catecholamines
in
PFC
,
a
region
involved
in
attention
and
memory
,
mediates
the
therapeutic
effects
of
atomoxetine
in
ADHD
.

In
contrast
to
methylphenidate
,
atomoxetine
did
not
increase
DA
in
striatum
or
nucleus
accumbens
,
suggesting
it
would
not
have
motoric
or
drug
abuse
liabilities
.

Throughout

PGs
)
by
its
high
level
of

PG

(
PGDH
)
.

In
this
study
,
we
investigate
the
effects
mediated
by
CRH
receptors
on
the
expression
of
PGDH
in
the
chorion
.

We
found
that
both
CRHR1
and
CRHR2
were
localized
in
cultured
chorion
trophoblast
cells
,
with
CRH-R1alpha
,
R1beta
,
R1c
,
R1e
,
and
R1f
and
CRHR2beta
isoforms
identified
in
these
cells
.

To
block
the
actions
of
endogenous
CRH
and
its
related
peptides
,
cultured
chorion
trophoblasts
were
treated
with
an
increasing
concentration
of
alpha-helical
CRH
9-41
,
the
nonselective
CRH
receptor
antagonist
,
which
resulted
in
decreased
mRNA
and
protein
expression
as
well
as
the
activity
of
PGDH
.

To
investigate
the
individual
role
of
CRHR1
and
CRHR2
,
cell
cultures
were
treated
with
the
specific
CRHR1
antagonist
antalarmin
and
CRHR2
antagonist
astressin2B
,
respectively
.

The
results
showed
that
antalarmin
increased
whereas
astressin2B
decreased
mRNA
and
protein
expression
as
well
as
the
activity
of
PGDH
in
chorion
cells
.

When
the
cells
were
treated
with
an
exclusive
CRHR2
agonist
,
urocortin
II
,
elevated
expression
and
activity
of
PGDH
was
exhibited
.

However
,
cells
treated
with
either
exogenous
CRH
or
urocortin
I
showed
significantly
increased
PGDH
expression
,
and
these
effects
could
be
blocked
by
astressin2B
but
not
by
antalarmin
.

We
suggest
that
,
in
chorion
trophoblast
cells
,
CRHR1
and
CRHR2
mediate
divergent
effects
on
PGDH
expression
,
and
this
may
provide
a
precise
regulation
of
PGs
levels
from
chorion
to
myometrium
during

Poly
(
ADP-ribose
)
polymerases
(
PARPs
)
or
diphtheria
toxin
like
ADP-ribosyl
transferases
(
ARTDs
)
are
enzymes
that
catalyze
the
covalent
modification
of
proteins
by
attachment
of
ADP-ribose
units
to
the
target
amino
acid
residues
or
to
the
growing
chain
of
ADP-ribose
.

A
subclass
of
the
ARTD
superfamily
consists
of
mono-ADP-ribosyl
transferases
that
are
thought
to
modify
themselves
and
other
substrate
proteins
by
covalently
adding
only
a
single
ADP-ribose
moiety
to
the
target
.

Many
of
the
ARTD
enzymes
are
either
established
or
potential
drug
targets
and
a
functional
activity
assay
for
them
will
be
a
valuable
tool
to
identify
selective
inhibitors
for
each
enzyme
.

Existing
assays
are
not
directly
applicable
for
screening
of
inhibitors
due
to
the
different
nature
of
the
reaction
and
different
target
molecules
.

We
modified
and
applied
a
fluorescence-based
assay
previously
described
for
PARP1
/
ARTD1
and
tankyrase
/
ARTD5
for
screening
of
PARP10
/
ARTD10
and
PARP15
/
ARTD7
inhibitors
.

The
assay
measures
the
amount
of
NAD
(
+
)
present
after
chemically
converting
it
to
a
fluorescent
analog
.

We
demonstrate
that
by
using

the

of
the

is
excellent
for

The
assay
is
homogenous
and

effective
,
making
it
possible
to
test
relatively
large
compound

.

This
method
can
be
used
to
screen
inhibitors
of
mono-ARTDs
and
profile
inhibitors
of
the
enzyme
class
.

The
assay
was
optimized
for
ARTD10
and
ARTD7
,
but
it
can
be
directly
applied
to
other
mono-ARTDs
of
the
ARTD
superfamily
.

Profiling
of
known
ARTD
inhibitors
against
ARTD10
and
ARTD7
in
a
validatory
screening
identified
the
best
inhibitors
with
submicromolar
potencies
.

Only
few
of
the
tested
ARTD
inhibitors
were
potent
,
implicating
that
there
is
a
need
to
screen
new
compound
scaffolds
.

This

The

examined
in

prepared
from
the

of

that
develop

The

(
3-day
)
studies
and
to
provoke
Leydig

with
prolonged
(
3-mo

administration
was
also
measured
.

Our
data
were
consistent
with
the
proposal
that
,
in
Leydig
cells
,
the
carcinogenic
effects
of
estrogens
are
mediated
through
the
intracellular
receptor
complex
that
results
in
a

but
to
varying
degrees;
and
there
was
no
discernible
relationship
between
their
ability
to
compete
for
this
receptor
and
their
efficacy
in
stimulating
DNA

.

The
effect
of
the

provoked
a

:
acutely
a
decrease
in
the
level
of
cytosolic

and
an
increase
in
the

All
of
these
substances
acutely
stimulated

.

Tamoxifen

provoked
a

no
increase
in

,
mestranol
,
and

did
not
significantly
alter
the
levels
of
estrogen

Only
those

also
acutely
stimulated

,
ethinylestradiol
,
and
nafoxidine
led
to
Leydig
cell
hyperplasia
.

Chronic
mestranol
treatment
also
provoked
Leydig
cell
hyperplasia;
this
is
most
probably
due
to
induction
of
liver
metabolism
of
mestranol
to
ethinylestradiol
.

Chronic

with
17
alpha-estradiol
,
tamoxifen

failed
to
produce

Only
chronic

of
those

produced

The
neuropathological
hallmarks
of
Alzheimer's
disease
(
AD
)
and
other
taupathies
include
neurofibrillary
tangles

Despite
the
fact
that
only
2-10%
of
AD
cases
are
associated
with
genetic
mutations
,
no
nontransgenic
or
metabolic
models

The
findings
of
tryptophanyl-tRNA
synthetase
(
TrpRS
)
in
plaques
of
the
AD
brain
were
reported
recently
by
the
authors
.

Here
it
is
shown
that
expression
of
cytoplasmic-TrpRS
is
inversely
correlated
with
neurofibrillary
degeneration
,
whereas
a
nonionic
detergent-insoluble
presumably
aggregated
TrpRS
is
simultaneously
accumulated
in
human
cells
treated
by
tryptamine
,
a
metabolic
tryptophan

that
acts
as

competitive
inhibitor
of
TrpRS

Tryptamine
induced
the

Taken

with
the
authors'
previous
findings
of

and
filamentous
tangle
formation
in
kidney
cells
,
the
authors'
data
indicates
a
general
role
of
tryptamine
in
cell
degeneration
and
loss
.

It
is
concluded
that
tryptamine
as
a
component
of
a
normal
diet
can
induce
neurodegeneration
at
the
concentrations
,
which
might
be
consumed
along

These
findings
indicate
that
the
dietary
supplementation
with
tryptophan
as
a
tryptamine
competitor
may
not
counteract
the
deleterious
influence
of
tryptamine
.

The
pivotal
role

Although
a
growing
body
of
evidence
suggests
that
soy
isoflavones
help
regulate
lipid
metabolism
,
the
underlying
mechanism
has
not
yet
been
thoroughly
clarified
.

The
present
study
was
undertaken
to
determine
the
effects
of
soy
isoflavones
on
the
expression
of
genes
involved
in
lipid
metabolism
in
different
adipose
tissue
depots
,
skeletal
muscle
and
liver
of
male
Huanjiang
mini-pigs
,
as
well
as
the
expression
of
adipokines
and
myokines
.

A
total
of
36
male
Huanjiang
mini-pigs
were
fed
basal
diet
(
control
,
Con
)
,
low-dose
soy
isoflavones
(
LSI
)
and
high-dose
soy
isoflavones
(
HSI
)
.

The
results
showed
that
LSI
and
HSI
regulated
the
expression
of
genes
involved
in
the
anabolism
and
catabolism
of
fatty
acids
in
dorsal
subcutaneous
(
DSA
)
,
abdominal
subcutaneous

ASA
)
and
perirenal
(
PRA
)
adipose
tissue
depots
,
as
well
as
longissimus
dorsi
muscle
(
LDM
)
and
liver
.

LSI
and
HSI
also
regulated
the
expression
of
adipokines
in
DSA
,
ASA
and
PRA
,
and
the
expression
of
myokines
in
LDM
in
male

.

In
addition
,
soy
isoflavones
regulated
plasma
glucose
,
leptin
and
adiponectin
contents
after
treatment
for
two
months
.

Our
results
indicate
that
soy
isoflavones
,
by
regulating
the
expression
of
adipokines
and
myokines
,
may
regulate
the
metabolism
of
lipids
and
could
have
potential

The
possible

of
adriamycin
(

)
and

selenium
(
Se
)
deficiency-induced
cardiac
dysfunction
,
and
cardioprotective
effects
of
Se
against
ADR-induced
cardiac
toxicity
were
investigated
in
this
study
.

Cardiac
function
was
evaluated
by
plasma
brain
natriuretic
peptide
level
and
echocardiographic
and
hemodynamic
parameters
.

Cardiac
glutathione
peroxidase
(
GPx
)
activity
was
assessed
spectrophotometrically
.

Expression
of
ATP-sensitive
potassium
channels
(
KATP
)
subunits-SUR2A
and
Kir6
.
2-were
examined
by
real-time
PCR
and
Western
blotting
.

The
results
showed
that
cardiac
function
and
cardiac
GPx
activity
decreased
remarkably
after
administration
of
ADR
or
Se
deficiency;
more
dramatic
impairment
of
cardiac
function
and
cardiac
GPx
activity
were
observed
after
co-administration
of
ADR
and
Se
deficiency
.

Mechanically
,
it
is
novel
for
us
to
find
down-regulation
of
KATP
subunits
gene
expression
in
cardiac
tissue
after
administration
of
ADR
or
Se
deficiency
,
and
more
significant
inhibition
of
cardiac
KATP
gene
expression
was
identified
after
co-administration
of
ADR
and
Se
deficiency
.

Furthermore
,
cardiac
toxicity
of
ADR
was
found
alleviated
by
Se
supplementation
,
accompanied
by
restoring
of
cardiac
GPx
activity
and
cardiac
KATP
gene
expression
.

These
results
indicate
that
decreased
expression
of
cardiac
KATP
is
involved
in
adriamycin
and
/
or
Se
deficiency-induced
cardiac
dysfunction;
Se
deficiency
exacerbates
adriamycin-induced
cardiac
dysfunction
by
future
inhibition
of
KATP
expression;
Se
supplementation
seems
to
protect
against
adriamycin-induced
cardiac
dysfunction
via
restoring
KATP
expression
,
showing
potential
clinical
application

Two
sodium-dependent
vitamin
C
transporter
isoforms
(
SVCT1
and
SVCT2
)
were
identified
as
ascorbic
acid
transporters
,
but
their
roles
in
skin
have
,
as
yet
,
not
been
elucidated
.

Here
we
analyze
the
expression
and
function
of
SVCTs
in
healthy
human
skin
cells
and
skin
tissues
,
and
in
UVB-induced
cutaneous
tissue
injury
.

SVCT1
was
primarily
found
in
the
epidermis
expressed
by
keratinocytes
,
whereas
SVCT2
expression
was
in
the
epidermis
and
dermis
in
keratinocytes
,
fibroblasts
,
and
endothelial
cells
.

Uptake
experiments
revealed
that
ascorbic
acid
affinity
of
SVCT1
was
lower
than
SVCT2
(
K
(
m
)
=
75
muM
and
K
(
m
)
=
44
muM
,
respectively
)
,
but
maximal
velocity
was
9-times
higher
(
36
nmol
/
min
/
well
)
.

In
keratinocytes
,
SVCT1
was
found
to
be
responsible
for
vitamin
C
transport
,
although
SVCT2
gene
expression
was
higher
.

On
UVB
irradiation
,
SVCT1
mRNA
expression
in
murine
skin
declined
significantly
in
a
time-
and
dose-dependent
manner
,
whereas
SVCT2
mRNA
levels
were
unchanged
.

Furthermore
,
UVB
irradiation
of
keratinocytes
in
vitro
was
accompanied
by
reduced
ascorbic
acid
transport
.

In
summary
,
these
data
indicate
that
the
two
vitamin
C
transporter
isoforms
fulfill
specific
functions
in
skin
:
SVCT1
is
responsible
for
epidermal
ascorbic
acid
supply
,
whereas
SVCT2
mainly
facilitates
ascorbic
acid
transport
in
the
dermal
compartment
.

UVB-induced
oxidative
stress
in
mice
resulted
in
depletion
of
SVCT1
mRNA
levels
and
led
to
significantly
decreased
ascorbic
acid
uptake
in
keratinocytes
,
providing
evidence
on
why
ascorbic
acid
levels
are
decreased
on
UVB
irradiation
in
vivo
.

The

profile
of
the
19-norprogestin
nomegestrol
acetate
(
NOMAC
)
is
,
at
least
in
part
,
defined
by
its
pattern
of
binding
affinities
to
the
different
steroid
hormone
receptors
.

In
the
present
study
,
its
affinity
to
the
progesterone
receptor
(
PgR
)
,
the
androgen
receptor
(
AR
)
and
the
estrogen
receptor
(
ER
)
was
re-evaluated
and
compared
to
those
obtained
for
progesterone
(
P
)
and
several
progestins
.

The
characteristics
of
binding
to
the
PgR
in

were
determined
and
Ki
were
found
to
be
roughly
similar
with

for
NOMAC
and

respectively
.

The

were
also
determined
and
compared
to
that
of
3H-ORG2058
with
Kd
of

6
nM
,
respectively
for
rat

and
4
and

,
respectively
for

.

Structure-affinity
and
-activity
relationships
were
studied
on
a
variety
of
compounds
related
to
NOMAC
in
order
to
assess
its
specificity
as
a
progestin
.

The
effects
of
NOMAC
on
the
binding
of
androgen
to
the
AR
were
investigated
,
using
rat
ventral
prostate
as
target
model
.

Contrary
to
what
was
observed
for
MPA
,
the
RBA
of
NOMAC
was
found
to
decline
with
time
,
showing
anti-androgenic
rather
than
androgenic
potential
,
a
result
that
was
confirmed
in
vivo
.

Regarding
the
ER
,
since
none
of
the
progestins
were
able
to
compete
with
estrogen
for
binding
in
rat
uterus
as
well
as
in
Ishikawa
cells
,
the
induction
of
alkaline

was
used
as
an

.

It
confirmed
the

:
a
physico-chemical
approach
.
PURPOSE
:
Removal
of
fucose
residues
from
the
oligosaccharides
of
human
antibody
is
a
powerful
approach
to
enhance
antibody-dependent
cellular
cytotoxicity
(
ADCC
)
,
a
potential
important
antitumor
mechanism
of
therapeutic
antibodies
.

To
provide
clinically
relevant
evidence
of
this
mechanism
,
we
investigated
ADCC
of
a
fucose-negative
version
of
trastuzumab
[
anti-human
epidermal
growth
factor
receptor
2
(
HER2
)
humanized
antibody
]
using
peripheral
blood
mononuclear
cells
(
PBMC
)
from
breast
cancer
patients
as
effector
cells
.

EXPERIMENTAL
DESIGN
:
Thirty
volunteers
,
including
20
breast
cancer
patients
and
10
normal
healthy
control
donors
,
were
recruited
randomly
,
and
aliquots
of
peripheral
blood
were
collected
.

ADCC
of
commercial
trastuzumab
(
fucosylated
)
and
its
fucose-negative
version
were
measured
using
PBMCs
drawn
from
the
volunteers
as
effector
cells
and
two
breast
cancer
cell
lines
with
different
HER2
expression
levels
as
target
cells
.

Relationships
between
cytotoxicity
and
characteristics
of
the
patients
,
such
as
content
of
natural
killer
cells
in
PBMCs
,
type
of
therapy
,
FCGR3A
genotypes
,
etc
.

were
also
analyzed
.

RESULTS
:
ADCC
was
significantly
enhanced
with
the
fucose-negative
antibody
compared
with
the
fucose-positive
antibody
using
PBMCs
from
either
normal
donors
or
breast
cancer
patients
.

Enhancement
of
ADCC
was
observed
irrespective
of
the
various
clinical
backgrounds
of
the
patients
,
even
in
the
chemotherapy
cohort
that
presented
with
a
reduced
number
of
natural
killer
cells
and
weaker
ADCC
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
This
preliminary
study
suggests
that
the
use
of
fucose-negative
antibodies
may
improve
the
therapeutic
effects
of
anti-HER2
therapy
for
patients
independent
of
clinical
backgrounds

Mechanisms
of
resistance
to
Tomudex
include
increased
thymidylate
synthase
activity
,
as
well
as
reduced
intracellular
drug
uptake
and
polyglutamation
.

However
,
little
is
known
about
other
mechanisms
of
resistance
,
such
as
a
possible
protection
against
Tomudex-induced
apoptosis
mediated
by
bcl-2
.

We
transfected
the
MDA-MB-435
human
breast
cancer
cell
line
,
which
is
characterized
by
a
mutated
p53
gene
,
with
cDNA
of
the
bcl-2
gene
and
generated
two
clones
(
MDA-bcl4
and
MDA-bcl7
)
characterized
by
bcl-2
expression
twofold
and
fourfold
that
observed
in
the
control
cell
clone
(
MDAneo
)
.

A
concomitant
overexpression
of
p21wafl
was
also
detected
in
the
MDA-bcl7
clone
.

The
MDA-bcl4
clone
was
three
times
more
resistant
to
a
24-h
Tomudex
exposure
than
the
MDAneo
clone
,
whereas
the
MDA-bcl7
clone
was
as
sensitive
to
Tomudex
as
the
control
cell
clone
.

A
lower
sensitivity
of
the
MDA-bcl4
clone
than
MDAneo
and
MDA-bcl7
clones
to
5-fluorouracil
and
gemcitabine
was
also
observed
.

No
significant
difference
was
noted
in
the
susceptibility
of
clones
to
fludarabine
and
methothrexate
.

Basal
levels
of
thymidylate
synthase
activity
were
superimposable
in
the
three
clones
.

Tomudex
induced
a
marked
accumulation
of
cells
in
the
S
phase
in
all
the
clones
.

However
,
an
apoptotic
hypodiploid
DNA
peak
and
the
characteristic
nuclear
morphology
of
apoptosis
were
observed
only
in
the
MDA-bcl7
clone
after
exposure
to
Tomudex
.

No
difference
in
the
treatment-induced
modulation
of
proteins
involved
in
cell
cycle
progression
(
cyclin
A
,
cdk2
,
pRB
,
E2F-1
)
and
apoptosis
(
bcl-2
,
bax
)
was
observed
in
the
three
clones
.

The
only
exception
was
that
the
expression
of
p21wafl
in
the
MDA-bcl4
clone
was
inducible
at
a
Tomudex
concentration
much
higher
than
that
required
to
induce
the
protein
in
the
other
clones
.

Overall
,
the
results
indicate
that
bcl-2
and
p21wafl
proteins
concur
in
determining
the
cellular
profile
of
sensitivity
/
resistance
to
Tomudex
.

The

catalyses
the

acid
,
leading
to
the

Recently
two
forms
of
cyclo-oxygenase
have
been
described
:
a
constitutive
(
COX-1
)
enzyme
present
in
most
cells
and
tissues
,
and
an
inducible
(
COX-2
)
isoenzyme
observed
in
many
cells
in
response
to
pro-inflammatory
cytokines
.

Constitutive
and
inducible

of

(
hCOX-1
and
hCOX-2
)
were
cloned
and
expressed
in
insect

.

hCOX-1

Indomethacin
inhibited
both
hCOX-1
and
hCOX-2
,
whereas
NS-398
and
Dup-697
selectively
inhibited
hCOX-2
.

Both
NS-398
and
Dup-697
exhibited
time-dependent
inactivation
of
hCOX-2
,
as
did
indomethacin
on
both
enzymes
.

The
competitive
inhibitor
of
hCOX-1
,
mefenamic
acid
,
also
displayed
competitive

of
hCOX-2
.

These
results
demonstrate
the

Abstract
Context
:
Exposure
to
phosgene
can
result
in
an
acute
lung
injury
,
leading
to
pulmonary
edema
and
even
death
.

Angiopoietin-1
(
Ang1
)
is
a
critical
factor
for
vascular
stabilization
due
to
its
ability
to
reduce
endothelial
permeability
and
inflammation
.

Objective
:
In
this
study
,
the
histopathological
changes
of
the
lungs
after
exposure
to
phosgene
and
the
effect
of
Ang1
treatment
were
examined
.

Materials
and
methods
:
Rats
were
exposed
to
phosgene

at
8
.
33

)
for

Ang1
overexpressing

were
established
by
an
intravenous
injection
of

(
Ad

)
.

The
histological
changes
of
the
lung
were
examined
by
Haematoxylin-Eosin
(
H&E
)
staining
and
fluorescence
microscopy
.

The
inferior
lobe
was
used
for
the
determination
of
the
ratio
of
wet
weight
to
dry
weight
of
the
lung
.

The
concentration
of
cytokines
in
the
serum
and
bronchoalveolar
lavage
fluid
was
determined
by
enzyme-linked
immunosorbent
assay
.

Results
:
The
pathological
analysis
showed
signs
of
inflammation
and
edema
,
evident
from
a
significant
increase
in
the
number
of
leukocytes
in
bronchoalveolar
lavage
fluid
and
the
ratio
of
wet
to
dry
weight
of
the
lungs
.

The
lung
injury
induced
by
phosgene
was
markedly
reduced
after
the
injection
of
Ad
/
Ang1
.

The
increase
of
IL-1β
and
IL-17
and
decrease
of
vascular
endothelial
growth
factor
in
the
serum
and
bronchoalveolar
lavage
fluid
of
phosgene-exposed
animals
were
abolished
by
the
administration
of
Ad
/
Ang1
.

Discussion
and
conclusions
:
Ang1
has
the
beneficial
effects
on
phosgene-induced
lung
injury
.

The
adenovirus-delivered
Ang1
may
have
the
potential
as
a
novel
approach
for
the
treatment
of
the

Glucocorticoids
(
GCs
)
influence
a
great
variety
of
cellular
functions
by
at
least
three
important
modes
of
action
:
the
activation
(
or
repression
)
of
genes
controlled
by
binding
sites
for
the
glucocorticoid
receptor
(
GR
)
,
the
induction
of
apoptosis
in
lymphocytes
and
the
recently
discovered
cross-talk
to
other
transcription
factors
such
as
NF-kappaB
.

In
this
study
we
systematically
compared
various
natural
and
synthetic
steroid
hormones
frequently
used
as
therapeutic
agents
on
their
ability
to
mediate
these
three
modes
of
action
.

Betamethasone
,
triamcinolone
,
dexamethasone
and
clobetasol
turned
out
to
be
the
best
inducers
of
gene
expression
and
apoptosis
.

All
GCs
including
the
antagonistic
compound
RU486
efficiently
reduced
NF-kappaB-mediated
transactivation
to
comparable
extents
,
suggesting
that
ligand-induced
nuclear
localization
of
the
GR
is
sufficient
for
transrepression
.

Glucocorticoid
treatment
of

did
not
result
in

Tyrosine
kinases
(
TKs
)
are
attractive
targets
for
cancer
therapy
,
as
quite
often
their
abnormal
signaling
has
been
linked
with
tumor
development
and
growth
.

Constitutive
activated
TKs
stimulate
multiple
signaling
pathways
responsible
for
DNA
repair
,
apoptosis
,
and
cell
proliferation
.

During
the
last
few
years
,
thorough
analysis
of
the
mechanism
underlying
tyrosine
kinase's
activity
led
to
novel
cancer
therapy
using
TKs
blockers
.

These
drugs
are
remarkably
effective
in
the
treatment
of
various
human
tumors
including
head
and
neck
,
gastric
,
prostate
and
breast
cancer
and
leukemias
.

The
most
successful
example
of
kinase
blockers
is
Imatinib
(
Imatinib
mesylate
,
Gleevec
,
STI571
)
,
the
inhibitor
of
Bcr
/
Abl
oncoprotein
,
which
has
become
a
first-line
therapy
for
chronic
myelogenous

.

The
introduction
of
STI571
for
the
treatment
of
leukemia
in
clinical
oncology
has
had
a
dramatic
impact
on
how
this
disease
is
currently
managed

Sphingomyelin
(
SM
)
is
a
vital
component
of
mammalian
membranes
,
providing
mechanical
stability
and
a
structural
framework
for
plasma
membrane
organization
.

Its
production
involves
the
transfer
of
phosphocholine
from
phosphatidylcholine
onto
ceramide
,
a
reaction
catalyzed
by
SM
synthase
in
the
Golgi
lumen
.

Drosophila
lacks
SM
and
instead
synthesizes
the
SM
analogue
ceramide
phosphoethanolamine
(
CPE
)
as
the
principal
membrane
sphingolipid
.

The
corresponding
CPE
synthase
shares
mechanistic
features
with
enzymes
mediating
phospholipid
biosynthesis
via
the
Kennedy
pathway
.

Using
a
functional
cloning
strategy
,
we
here
identified
a
CDP-ethanolamine
:
ceramide
ethanolamine
phosphotransferase
as
the
enzyme
responsible
for
CPE
production
in
Drosophila
.

CPE
synthase
constitutes
a
new
branch
within
the
CDP-alcohol
phosphotransferase
superfamily
with
homologues
in
Arthropoda
(
insects
,
spiders
,
mites
,
scorpions
)
,
Cnidaria
(
Hydra
,
sea
anemones
)
,
and
Mollusca
(
oysters
)
but
not
in
most
other
animal
phyla
.

The
enzyme
resides
in
the
Golgi
complex
with
its
active
site
facing
the
lumen
,
contrary
to
the
membrane
topology
of
other
CDP-alcohol
phosphotransferases
.

Our
findings
open
up
an
important
new
avenue
to
address
the
biological
role

We
demonstrated
previously
that
tumor

factor-alpha
(
TNF-α
)
plays
an
important
role
in
a
rat
model
of
AMD-induced
hepatotoxicity
under
inflammatory
stress
.

In
this
study
,
we
developed
a
model
in
vitro
to
study
the
roles
of
caspase
activation
and
oxidative
stress
in
TNF
potentiation
of
AMD
cytotoxicity
.

AMD
caused
cell
death
in
Hepa1c1c7
cells
,
and
TNF
cotreatment
potentiated
its
toxicity
.

Activation
of
caspases
9
and
3
/
7
was
observed
in
AMD
/
TNF-cotreated
cells
,
and
caspase
inhibitors
provided
minor
protection
from
cytotoxicity
.

Intracellular
reactive
oxygen
species
(
ROS
)
generation
and
lipid
peroxidation
were
observed
after
treatment
with
AMD
and
were
further
elevated
by
TNF
cotreatment
.

Adding
water-soluble
antioxidants
(
trolox
,
N-acetylcysteine
,
glutathione
,
or
ascorbate
)
produced
only
minor
attenuation
of
AMD
/
TNF-induced
cytotoxicity
and
did
not
influence
the
effect
of
AMD
alone
.

On
the
other
hand
,
α-tocopherol
(
TOCO
)
,
which
reduced
lipid
peroxidation
and
ROS
generation
,
prevented
AMD

and
caused

from
AMD

cotreatment

α-TOCO
plus
a
pancaspase
inhibitor
completely
abolished

In
summary
,

Aldosterone
plays
a
major
role
in
regulating

homeostasis
,
and
blood
pressure
.

More
recently
aldosterone
has
emerged
as
a
key
hormone
in
mediating
end
organ
damage
.

In
extreme
cases
,
dysregulated
aldosterone
production
leads
to
primary
aldosteronism
,
the
most
common
form
of
secondary
hypertension
.

However
,
even
within
the
physiological
range
,
high
levels
of
aldosterone
are
associated
with
an
increased
risk
of
developing
hypertension
over
time
.

Primary
aldosteronism
represents
the
most
common
and
curable
form
of
hypertension
,
with
a
prevalence
that
increases
with
the
severity
of

.

Although
genetic

,
one
of
the
three

,
were

Consistent

This
may

A

a
reduction
in

52
hours
that
became
progressively
greater
with
the
duration

These
changes
are
indicative

Anaplastic
thyroid
carcinoma
(

We
hypothesized
that
sorafenib

multikinase
inhibitor
of
the
BRaf
,
vascular
endothelial
growth
factor
receptor-2
,
and
platelet-derived

would
decrease

growth
and
angiogenesis
in

model
of
ATC
.

The
in

antiproliferative
and
proapoptotic
effects
of
sorafenib
on
ATC
cell
lines
were
examined
.

To
study
the
in
vivo
effects
of
sorafenib
on
orthotopic
ATC
tumors
in
nude
mice
,
sorafenib
was
given
p
.

o
.

at
40
or
80
mg
/
kg
daily
.

Intratumoral
effects
were
studied
using
immunohistochemical
analysis
.

The
effect
of
sorafenib
on
survival
of
the
mice
was
also
studied
.

Sorafenib
inhibited
the
in
vitro
proliferation
of
ATC
cell
lines
.

Sorafenib
also
significantly
inhibited
tumor
angiogenesis
via
the
induction
of
endothelial
apoptosis
in
an
orthotopic
model
of
thyroid
cancer
.

As
result
,
the
growth
of
orthotopic
ATC
xenografts
was
reduced
and
the
survival
of
the
test
animals
was
improved
.

Sorafenib
exerts
significant
antitumor
activity
in
an
orthotopic
xenograft
model
of
ATC
via
a
potent
antiangiogenic
effect
.

The
antiangiogenic
effects
of
sorafenib
suggest
that
its
use
in
clinical
setting
may
not
depend
on
the
BRAF
mutational
status
of
thyroid
tumors
.

Given
the
lack
of
curative
options
for
patients
with
ATC
,
sorafenib
warrants
further
study
as
a
therapeutic
agent
against
ATC
.
Plasma
concentrations
of
sibutramine
and
its
two
active
metabolites
after
single
oral
dose
of
sibutramine
were
determined
in
Korean
healthy
male
subjects
with
different
CYP2B6
genotypes
(
CYP2B6*1
/
*1
,
*1
/
*6
and
*6
/
*6
)
,
either
alone
or
after
four-day
pretreatment
with
clopidogrel
or
clarithromycin
.

The
pretreatment
with
clopidogrel
and
clarithromycin
raised
the
mean
area
under
the
concentration-time
curve
(
AUC
)
of
sibutramine
by
163%
and
255%
,
respectively
.

Co-administration
of
clarithromycin
,
combined
with
CYP2B6*6
/
*6
genotype
,
led
to
highest
concentration
of
sibutramine
.

The
molar
sum
AUC
(
M1
+
M2
)
was
raised
by
35%
in
the
clopidogrel
phase
but
not
significantly
affected
by
clarithromycin
or
CYP2B6
genotype
.

The
CYP2B6*6
/
*6
subjects
in
the
clopidogrel
phase
showed
the
highest
molar
AUC
(
M1
+
M2
)
among
three
genotype
groups
throughout
the
three
phases
.

The
exposure
of
sibutramine
and
its
metabolites
seemed
to
be
associated
with
the
CYP2B6
genotype
.

The
treatment
of
clopidogrel
significantly
altered
the
disposition
of
active
metabolites
as
well
as
sibutramine
,
but
clarithromycin
only
affects
the
disposition
of
sibutramine
.

These
results
suggest
that
the
perturbation
of
CYP2B6
activity
may
contribute
to
the
inter-individual
variation
of
sibutramine
drug
responses
although
the
clinical
relevance
is
remained
to
be
established
.
In
this
study
the
sterol
and
oxysterol
profile
of
newborn
brain
from
the
Dhcr7
(
Δ3-5
/
T93M
)
mouse
model
of
Smith-Lemli-Opitz
syndrome
(
SLOS
)
has
been
investigated
.

This
is
a
viable
mouse
model
which
is
compound
heterozygous
containing
one
null
allele
and
one
T93M
mutation
on
Dhcr7
.

We
find
the
SLOS
mouse
has
reduced
levels
of
cholesterol
and
desmosterol
and
increased
levels
of
7-
and
8-dehydrocholesterol
and
of
7-
and
8-dehydrodesmosterol
in
brain
compared
to
the
wild
type
.

The
profile
of
enzymatically
formed
oxysterols
in
the
SLOS
mouse
resembles
that
in
the
wild
type
but
the
level
of
24S-hydroxycholesterol
,
the
dominating
cholesterol
metabolite
,
is
reduced
in
a
similar
proportion
to
that
of
cholesterol
.

A
number
of
oxysterols
abundant
in
the
SLOS
mouse
are
probably
derived
from
7-dehydrocholesterol
,
however
,
the
mechanism
of
their
formation
is
unclear
.
We
recently
showed
that
clones
of
Th1
cells
,
but
not
Th2
cells
,
expressed
a
functional
beta-2-adrenergic
receptor
(
beta2AR
)
and
that
either
norepinephrine
or
the
beta2AR
agonist
terbutaline
stimulated
this
receptor
to
modulate
the
level
of
Th1
cytokines
produced
.

In
the
present
study
,
we
show
that
norepinephrine
and
terbutaline
stimulate
the
beta2AR
to
decrease
the
level
of
IL-2
produced
by
freshly
isolated
murine
splenic
naive
CD4
+
T
cells
from
either
Balb

10
transgenic
mice
and
activated
polyclonally
with
anti-CD3
and
anti-CD28
mAbs
.

In
contrast
,
the
level
of
cytokines
produced
by
primary
effector
Th1
and
Th2
cells
were
unaffected
when
norepinephrine
,
terbutaline
,
or
cAMP
analogs
were
added
at
the
time
of

.

These
results
suggest
that
a
diversity
exists
among
CD4

T-cell
subsets
with
respect
to
the
level
of
adrenergic

expression
,

,
or
a

INTRODUCTION
:
Medroxyprogesterone

)
induces
estrogen

ER
)
-positive
and
progesterone
receptor
(
PR
)
-positive
ductal
invasive
mammary
carcinomas
in
BALB
/
c
mice
.

We
sought
to
reproduce
this
MPA
cancer
model
in
C57BL
/
6
mice
because
of
their
widespread
use
in
genetic
engineering
.

Within
this
experimental
setting
,
we
studied
the
carcinogenic
effects
of
MPA
,
the
morphologic
changes
in
mammary
glands
that
are
induced
by
MPA
and
progesterone
,
and
the
levels
of
ER
and
PR
expression
in
MPA-treated
and
progesterone-treated
mammary
glands
.

Finally
,
we
evaluated
whether
the
differences
found
between
BALB
/
c
and
C57BL
/
6
mouse
strains
were
due
to
intrinsic
differences
in
epithelial
cells
.

METHODS
:
The
carcinogenic
effect
of
MPA
was
evaluated
in
C57BL
/
6
mice
using
protocols
proven
to
be
carcinogenic
in
BALB
/
c
mice
.

In
addition
,
BALB
/
c
and
C57BL
/
6
females
were
treated
with
progesterone
or
MPA
for
1
or
2
months
,
and
mammary
glands
were
excised
for
histologic
studies
and
for
immunohistochemical
and
Western
blot
evaluation
of
ER
and
PR
.

Hormone
levels
were
determined
by
radioimmunoassay
.

Isolated
mammary
epithelial
cells
were
transplanted
into
cleared
fat
pads
of
21-day-old
female
Swiss
nu
/
nu
mice
or
control
congenic
animals
.

RESULTS
:
MPA
failed
to
induce
mammary
carcinomas
or
significant
morphologic
changes
in
the
mammary
glands
of
C57BL
/
6
mice
.

The
expression
of
ER-alpha
and
PR
isoform
A
in
virgin
mice
was
surprisingly
much
higher
in
BALB
/
c
than
in
C57BL
/
6
mammary
glands
,
and
both
receptors
were
downregulated
in
progestin-treated
BALB
/
c
mice
(
P
<
0
.
05
)
.

PR
isoform
B
levels
were
low
in
virgin
control
mice
and
increased
after
progestin
treatment
in
both
strains
.

ER-beta
expression
followed
a
similar
trend
.

No
differences
in
hormone
levels
were
found
between
strains
.

Surprisingly
,
the
transplantation
of
the
epithelial
mammary
gland
cells
of
both
strains
into
the
cleared
fat
pads
of
Swiss
(
nu
/
nu
)
mice
abolished
the
mammary
gland
morphologic
differences
and
the
ER
and
PR
differences
between
strains
.

CONCLUSION
:
C57BL
/
6
mammary
glands
are
resistant
to
MPA-induced
carcinogenesis
and
to
hormone
action
.

MPA
and
progesterone
have
different
effects
on
mammary
glands
.

Low
ER-alpha
and
PR-A
levels
in
untreated
mammary
glands
may
be
associated
with
a
low-risk
breast
cancer
profile
.

Although
we
cannot
at
this
time
rule
out
the
participation
of
other
,
untested
factors
,
our
findings
implicate
the
stroma
as
playing
a
crucial
role
in
the
strain-specific
differential
hormone
receptor
expression
and
hormone
responsiveness
.
The
pharmacodynamics
of
non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory
drugs
(
NSAIDs
)
are
for
the
most
part
well-understood
.

All
NSAIDs
inhibit
the
enzyme
cyclooxygenase
(
COX
)
,
and
for
this
reason
prostaglandin
synthesis
.

Two
isoforms
of
COX
could
be
isolated
.

COX-1
is
detectable
in
most
tissues
on
a
constant
level
and
is
responsible
for
the
synthesis
of
prostaglandins
with
cytoprotective
effects
.

COX-2
is
induced
through
inflammation
and
supports
the
inflammatory
process
by
producing
pro-inflammatory
prostaglandins
.

The
desired
effects
of
NSAIDs
are
related
to
inhibition
of
COX-2
,
whereas
inhibition
of
COX-1
has
been
linked
to
the
typical
side-effects
of
NSAIDs
,
especially
in
the
stomach
and
kidney
.

The
great
differences
between
effects
and
side-effects
in
the
numerous
substances
can
be
explained
because
of
different
interactions
of
the
NSAIDs
on
COX-1
and
COX-2
.

In
various
test
systems
meloxicam
has
been
shown
to
be
a
preferential
inhibitor
of
COX-2
.

There
are
also
large
differences
between
the
individual
NSAIDs
with
regard
to
pharmacokinetics
.

Meloxicam
is
completely
absorbed
from
the
gastrointestinal
tract
and
has
an
elimination
half-life
of
24
hours
in
the
dog
.

It
is
excreted
in
faeces
and
urine
.

The
metabolites
,
detectable
in
urine
are
biologically
inactive
and
do
not
influence
the
prostaglandin
synthesis
in
the
kidney
.

In
the
underlying
study
,
plasma
concentration
of
meloxicam
was
determined
after
a
subcutaneous
injection
of
0
.
2
mg
/
kg
b
.

w
.

(
day
1
)
followed
by
oral
treatment
of
0
.
1
mg
/
kg
b
.

w
.

(
days
2-14
)
.

The
results
confirm
the
recommended
dosage
regime
of
meloxicam
with
its
initial
loading
dose
and
the
subsequent
maintenance
dose
.

This
dosing
regime
results
in
a
very
favourable
curve
of
concentrations
with
a
very
rapidly
attained
steady
state
after
roughly
two
days
,
without
accumulation
even
in
long-term
treatment
.
Treatment
of
human
neoplastic
cells
with
dacarbazine
both
inhibits
DNA
synthesis
and
induces
damage
in
the
DNA
.

Lysis
of
cells
in
dilute
alkali
and
subsequent
electrophoretic
analysis
of
the
isolated
DNA
show
that
the
DNA
of
treated
cells
includes
a
high
molecular
weight
component
and
a
population
of
2-10-kilobase
single-stranded
DNA
fragments
while
untreated
cells
contain
only
high
molecular
weight
DNA
.

When
DNA
is
pulse-labeled
at
the
beginning
of
the
dacarbazine
treatment
high
amounts
of
small
DNA
fragments
are
seen
but
no
labeled
high
molecular
weight
DNA
.

Moreover
the
DNA
fragments
are
not
formed
in
cells
which
are
treated
with
aphidicolin
before
the
addition
of
dacarbazine
.

Aphidicolin
is
a
specific
inhibitor
of
DNA
polymerase
alpha
,
the
enzyme
responsible
for
the
replicative
synthesis
of
DNA
.

We
conclude
that
dacarbazine
damages
DNA
only
in
cells
which
are
synthesizing
new
DNA
.

Resistance
to
chemotherapy
is
a
major
obstacle
for
curative
treatment
of
human
gastric
cancer
(
GC
)
.

However
,
the
underlying
molecular
mechanisms
are
largely
unknown
.

Wingless-type

family
members
(
WNTs
)
are
secreted
glycoproteins
involved
in
embryogenesis
and
,
on
inappropriate
expression
in
the
adult
,
in
cancer
.

Here
,
we
show
expression
of
WNT6
in
GC
patient
specimens
,
human
GC
cell
lines
and
in
a
mouse
model
of
GC
.

In
human
GC
cells
,
WNT6
expression
was
enhanced
by
caveolin-1
(
Cav1
)
,
a
scaffold
protein
of
plasma
membrane
caveolae
.

WNT6
knock-down
and
overexpression
experiments
demonstrated
that
WNT6
increased
the
resistance
to
apoptotic
cell
death
induced
by
the
anthracycline
chemotherapeutics
epirubicin
(
Epi
)
and
doxorubicin
(
Dox
)
.

Epi
increased
the
activity
of
the
human
WNT6
promoter
through
Cav1-dependent
binding
of
β-catenin
to
the
proximal
WNT6
promoter
.

Epi
increased
both
WNT6
/
Wnt6
and
Cav1
expression
in
human
GC
cells
and
within
the
tumor
area
of
a
murine
model
of
GC
(
CEA424-SV40
TAg
)
.

In
GC
patients
,
WNT6
expression
was
positively
associated
with
the
tumor
stage
and
the
nodal
status
,
and
inversely
correlated
with
the
response
to
ECF
(
Epi
,
cisplatin
,
5-fluorouracil
)
chemotherapy
.

These
results
showed
that
WNT6
and
Cav1
are
upregulated
by
chemotherapeutics
and
enhance
the
resistance
of
GC
cells
to
anthracycline
drugs
.

Understanding
the
molecular
mechanisms
driving
WNT6
/
Cav1-induced
drug
resistance
will
provide
benefits
in
developing

Avermectin
(
AVM
)
is
a
macrocyclic
lactone
agent
widely
used
as
a
nematicide
,
acaricide
and
insecticide
in
veterinary
medicine
and
plant
protection
.

P-glycoprotein
(
P-gp
)
is
an
ATP-dependent
drug
efflux
pump
for
xenobiotic
compounds
,
and
is
involved
in
multidrug
resistance
.

To
understand
the
development
of
AVM
resistance
in
invertebrates
,
we
investigated
the
mechanisms
by
which
AVM
affected
P-gp
expression
in
Drosophila
S2
cells
.

We
found
that
AVM
induced
upregulation
of
P-gp
protein
expression
,
increased
P-gp
ATPase
activity
and
enhanced
cellular
efflux
of
the
P-gp
substrate
rhodamine
123
from
cells
.

Furthermore
,
we
observed
that
AVM-induced
expression
of
P-gp
was
due
to
elevation
of
intracellular
calcium
concentration
(
[
Ca
(
2
+
)
]
i
)
.

This
occurred
both
directly
,
by
activating
calcium
ion
channels
,
and
indirectly
,
by
activating
chloride
ion
channels
.

These
results
are
supported
by
our
observations
that
verapamil
,
a
Ca
(
2
+
)
channel
blocker
,
and
niflumic
acid
,
a
chloride
channel
antagonist
,
significantly
attenuated
AVM-induced
[
Ca
(
2
+
)
]
i
elevation
,
thereby
reducing
P-gp
expression
.

Inhibition
of
P-gp
with
anti-P-gp
antibody
or
cyclosporine
A
(
a
P-gp
inhibitor
)
reduced
the
AVM-induced
elevation
of
[
Ca
(
2
+
)
]
i
,
implying
that
P-gp
and
[
Ca
(
2
+
)
]
i
regulate
each
other
.

Finally
,
we
found
that
trifluoperazine
,
a
calmodulin
inhibitor
,
and
pyrrolidine
dithiocarbamic
acid
,
an
NF-κB
inhibitor
,
attenuated
the
AVM-induced
expression
of
P-gp
,
suggesting
that
AVM
induces
P-gp
protein
expression
via
the
calmodulin
/
Relish

signaling
pathway
.
This
study
was
designed
to
investigate
the
reproductive
toxicity
of
aluminium
sulphate
and
the
therapeutic
effects
of
administration
of
zinc
sulphate
and
vitamin
E
individually
or
in
combination
against
the
toxic
effect
caused
by
aluminium
(
Al
)
in
male
albino
rats
.

The
animals
were
divided
into
five
groups
:
group
1
received
distilled

and
served
as
control;
group
2
received

)
and
vitamin

(
15
mg

w
.

)
;
group
5
received
aluminium
sulphate
plus
a
combination
of
zinc
sulphate
and
vitamin
E
in
similar
doses
as
above
.

Doses
were
administered
orally
once
daily
for
45
consecutive
days
.

The
results
revealed
that
aluminium
sulphate
induced
significant
decrease
in
body
weight
gain
and
testis
weight
and
significant
increase
in
Al
level
in
both
serum
and
testes
of
male
rats
.

Biochemical
analysis
showed
significant
decrease
in
serum
total
protein
and
phospholipids
levels
,
while
serum
total
lipid
was
significantly
elevated
post
Al
treatment
.

In
addition
,
significant
decrease
in
total
protein
,
phospholipids
and
cholesterol
levels
in
the
testes
of
Al-treated
rats
was
recorded
.

The
data
also
showed
significant
decrease
in
the
levels
of
serum
testosterone
,
leutinizing
hormone
and
follicle
stimulating
hormone
and
significant
increase
in
the
level
of
serum
prolactin
in
Al-intoxicated
rats
.

Moreover
,
histological
examination
showed
that
aluminium
sulphate
caused
apparent
alterations
in
the
testicular
structure
of
the
treated
animals
.

Treatment
with
zinc
sulphate
and
vitamin
E
individually
or
in
combination
ameliorated
the
harmful
effects
of
Al
,
which
was
proved
histopathologically
by
the
noticeable
improvement
in
the
testicular
tissues
.

We
can
conclude
that
the
tested
dose
of
aluminium
sulphate
induced
toxic
effect
on
the
reproductive
system
of
male
albino
rats
and
the
treatment
with
zinc
sulphate
and
/
or
vitamin
E
alleviated
these
toxic
effects
.

In
some
cases
,
vitamin
E
exerted
a
more
potent
effect
,
while
in
other
cases
,
the
more
potent
effect
is
related
to
zinc
sulphate
and
the
combination
of
both
at
most
of
the
recorded
data

Post-hoc
analysis
of
two
phase
III
clinical
studies
found
that
the
phosphodiesterase
4
(
PDE4
)
inhibitor
,
roflumilast
,
reduced
exacerbation
frequency
in
patients
with
severe
chronic
obstructive
pulmonary
disease
(
COPD
)
who
were
taking
inhaled
corticosteroids
(
ICS
)
concomitantly
,
whereas
patients
not
taking
ICS
derived
no
such
benefit
.

In
contrast
,
in
two
different
trials
also
performed
in
patients
with
severe
COPD
,
roflumilast
reduced
exacerbation
rates
in
the
absence
of
ICS
,
indicating
that
PDE4
inhibition
alone
is
sufficient
for
therapeutic
activity
to
be
realized
.

Given
that
roflumilast
is
recommended
as
an
"add-on"
medication
to
patients
with
severe
disease
who
will
inevitably
be
taking
a
long-acting
β2-adrenoceptor
agonist
(
LABA
)
/
ICS
combination
therapy
,
we
tested
the
hypothesis
that
roflumilast
augments
the
ability
of
glucocorticoids
to
induce
genes
with
anti-inflammatory
activity
.

Using
a
glucocorticoid
response
element
(
GRE
)
luciferase
reporter
transfected
into
human
airway
epithelial
cells
[
both
bronchial
epithelium
+
adenovirus
12
-
SV40
hybrid
(
BEAS-2B
)
cells
and
primary
cultures
]
,
roflumilast
enhanced
fluticasone
propionate-induced
GRE-dependent
transcription
.

Roflumilast
also
produced
a
sinistral
displacement
of
the
concentration-response
curves
that
described
the
augmentation
of
GRE-dependent
transcription
by
the
LABA
formoterol
.

In
BEAS-2B
cells
and
primary
airway
epithelia
,
roflumilast
interacted
with
formoterol
in
a
positive
cooperative
manner
to
enhance
the
expression
of
several
glucocorticoid-inducible
genes
that
have
anti-inflammatory
potential
.

We
suggest
that
the
ability
of
roflumilast
and
formoterol
to
interact
in
this
way
supports
the
concept
that
these
drugs
together
may
impart
clinical
benefit
beyond
that
achievable
by
an
ICS
alone
,
a
PDE4
inhibitor
alone
,
or
an
ICS
/
LABA
combination
therapy
.

Roflumilast
may
,
therefore
,
be
especially
effective
in
patients
with
severe
COPD
.
The
present
study
examined
the
potential
membrane
retention
of
desipramine
(
DMI
)
following
exposures
of
293-hNET
cells
to
DMI
,
and
its
effect
on
[
3H
]
NE
uptake
.

Incubation
of
cells
with
500
nM
DMI
for
1
h
or
1
day
persistently
inhibited
the
uptake
of
[
3H
]
NE
up
to
7
days
,
despite
daily
repeated
washing
of
cells
with
drug-free
medium
.

Uptake
inhibition
was
paralleled
by
persistent
retention
of
DMI
associated
with
cells
,
as
determined
by
HPLC
and
by
radiotracer
experiments
using
[
3H
]
DMI
.

[
3H
]
DMI
trapped
in
membranes
was
displaceable
by
the
structurally
unrelated
NET
inhibitor
,
nisoxetine
,
in
a
concentration-dependent
manner
,
implying
interaction
of
retained
[
3H
]
DMI
with
the
NET
.

A
similar
cellular
retention
was
observed
following
incubation
of
cells
with
nisoxetine
.

The
results
demonstrate
that
DMI
and
nisoxetine
are
persistently
retained
in
cell
membranes
,
at
least
partly
in
association
with
the
NET
.

The
retention
and
slow
diffusion
of
DMI
and
nisoxetine
from
membranes
may
contribute
to
their
pharmacological
and
modulatory
action
on
NET
.

BACKGROUND
:

Here
we
report
on
the
post-translational

and
functionality
of
recombinant
human
FI
(
rFI
)
made
at
commodity
levels
in
the
milk
of
transgenic

cows
.

Relative
to
plasma-derived
fibrinogen
(
pdFI
)
,
rFI
predominately
contained
a
simplified

structure
and
>4-fold
higher

of

that
has
been

PURPOSE
:
The
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
determine
the
frequency
and
spectrum
of
inosine
monophosphate
dehydrogenase
type
I
(
IMPDH1
)
mutations
associated
with
autosomal
dominant
retinitis
pigmentosa
(
RP
)
,
to
determine
whether
mutations
in
IMPDH1
cause
other
forms
of
inherited
retinal
degeneration
,
and
to
analyze
IMPDH1
mutations
for
alterations
in
enzyme
activity
and
nucleic
acid
binding
.

METHODS
:
The
coding
sequence
and
flanking
intron
/
exon
junctions
of
IMPDH1
were
analyzed
in
203
patients
with
autosomal
dominant
RP
(
adRP
)
,
55
patients
with
autosomal
recessive
RP
(
arRP
)
,
7
patients
with
isolated
RP
,
17
patients
with
macular
degeneration
(
MD
)
,
and
24
patients
with
Leber
congenital
amaurosis
(
LCA
)
.

DNA
samples
were
tested
for
mutations
by
sequencing
only
or
by
a
combination
of
single-stranded
conformational
analysis
and
by
sequencing
.

Production
of
fluorescent
reduced
nicotinamide
adenine
dinucleotide
(
NADH
)
was
used
to
measure
enzymatic
activity
of
mutant
IMPDH1
proteins
.

The
affinity
and
the
specificity
of
mutant
IMPDH1
proteins
for
single-stranded
nucleic
acids
were
determined
by
filter-binding
assays
.

RESULTS
:
Five
different
IMPDH1
variants
,
Thr116Met
,
Asp226Asn
,
Val268Ile
,
Gly324Asp
,
and
His
372Pro
,
were
identified
in
eight
autosomal
dominant
RP
families
.

Two
additional
IMPDH1
variants
,
Arg105Trp
and
Asn198Lys
,
were
found
in
two
patients
with
isolated
LCA
.

None
of
the
novel
IMPDH1
mutants
identified
in
this
study
altered
the
enzymatic
activity
of
the
corresponding
proteins
.

In
contrast
,
the
affinity
and
/
or
the
specificity
of
single-stranded
nucleic
acid
binding
were
altered
for
each
IMPDH1
mutant
except
the
Gly324Asp
variant
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
Mutations
in
IMPDH1
account
for
approximately
2%
of
families
with
adRP
,
and
de
novo
IMPDH1
mutations
are
also
rare
causes
of
isolated
LCA
.

This
analysis
of
the
novel
IMPDH1
mutants
substantiates
previous
reports
that
IMPDH1
mutations
do
not
alter
enzyme
activity
and
demonstrates
that
these
mutants
alter
the
recently
identified
single-stranded
nucleic
acid
binding
property
of
IMPDH
.

Studies
are
needed
to
further
characterize
the
functional
significance
of
IMPDH1
nucleic
acid
binding
and
its
potential
relationship
to
retinal
degeneration
.
GH
receptor
(
GHR
)
gene-disrupted
mice
(
GHR-
/
-
)
have
provided
countless
discoveries
as
to
the
numerous
actions
of
GH
.

Many
of
these
discoveries
highlight
the
importance
of
GH
in
adipose
tissue
.

For
example
GHR-
/
-
mice
are
insulin
sensitive
yet
obese
with
preferential
enlargement
of
the
sc
adipose
depot
.

GHR-
/
-
mice
also
have
elevated
levels
of
leptin
,
resistin
,
and
adiponectin
,
compared
with
controls
leading
some
to
suggest
that
GH
may
negatively
regulate
certain
adipokines
.

To
help
clarify
the
role
that
GH
exerts
specifically
on
adipose
tissue
in
vivo
,
we
selectively
disrupted
GHR
in
adipose
tissue
to
produce
Fat
GHR
Knockout
(
FaGHRKO
)
mice
.

Surprisingly
,
FaGHRKOs
shared
only
a
few
characteristics
with
global
GHR-
/
-
mice
.

Like
the
GHR-
/
-
mice
,
FaGHRKO
mice
are
obese
with
increased
total
body
fat
and
increased
adipocyte
size
.

However
,
FaGHRKO
mice
have
increases
in
all
adipose
depots
with
no
improvements
in
measures
of
glucose
homeostasis
.

Furthermore
,
resistin
and
adiponectin
levels
in
FaGHRKO
mice
are
similar
to
controls
(
or
slightly
decreased
)
unlike
the
increased
levels
found
in
GHR-
/
-
mice
,
suggesting
that
GH
does
not
regulate
these
adipokines
directly
in
adipose
tissue
in
vivo
.

Other
features
of
FaGHRKO
mice
include
decreased
levels
of
adipsin
,
a
near-normal
GH
/
IGF-1
axis
,
and
minimal
changes
to
a
large
assortment
of
circulating
factors
that
were
measured
such
as
IGF-binding
proteins
.

In
conclusion
,
specific
removal
of
GHR
in
adipose
tissue
is
sufficient
to
increase
adipose
tissue
and
decrease
circulating
adipsin
.

However
,
removal
of
GHR
in
adipose
tissue
alone
is
not
sufficient
to
increase
levels
of
resistin
or
adiponectin
and
does
not
alter
glucose
metabolism

BACKGROUND
:
Susceptibility
to
bladder
cancer
is
thought
to
depend
on
interplay
between
genetic
factors
and
environmental
chemical
carcinogens
.

AIM
:
This
study
seeks
to
determine
the
role
of
the
glutathione
transferases
M1
and
T1
null
genotypes
(
GSTM1*0
and
GSTT1*0
)
in
individual
susceptibility
to

cancer
in
a
Tunisian
population
.

METHOD
:
Sixty-two
patients
with
transitional
cell
carcinoma
of
the
bladder
cancer
and
79
controls
were
examined
with
respect
to
the
frequency
of
GSTM1
and
GSTT1
null
genotypes
.

RESULTS
:
The
frequencies
of
the
GSTT1
null
in
the
total
group
of
bladder
cancer
cases
vs
.

controls
did
not
differ
statistically
.

The
proportion
of
GSTM1
null
genotype
in
patients
was
63%
compared
to
45%
in
controls

.

A
significantly
higher
incidence
of
GSTM1

genotype
was
found
in
smokers
with
bladder
cancer
compared
to
the
controls
(
65

)
.

Smokers
lacking
the
GSTM1

are
at
an
approximately
2
.
2-fold
higher
risk
of

.

CONCLUSION
:
This
study
suggests
that
in
Tunisian
subjects
the
GSTM1
null
genotype
may
be
associated
with
an
increased
risk
of
bladder
cancer
.

This
association
appears
to
depend
upon

Despite
more
than
a
decade
of
research
in
the
field
of
endocrine
active
compounds
targeting
the
androgen
receptor
(
AR
)
,
and
although
suitable
cell
lines
can
be
obtained
,
no
validated
human
stably
transfected
androgen
sensitive
transactivation
assay
is
available
.

Bayer
Schering
Pharma
(
BSP
)
and
the
Flemish
Institute
for
Technological
Research
(
VITO
)
,
partners
within
the
EU-sponsored
6th
framework
project
ReProTect
,
made
first
steps
towards
such
a
validation
.

A
standard
operation
protocol
(
SOP
)
developed
at
BSP
based
on
the
androgen
sensitive
PALM
cell
line
was
transferred
to
VITO
and
its
performance
and
transferability
were
thoroughly
studied
.

The
investigation
followed
a
generic
protocol
prepared
for
all
reporter
gene
assays
evaluated
within
ReProTect
,
and
in
both
laboratories
at
least
three
independent
experiments
were
performed
.

The
highest
concentration
to
be
tested
was
limited
to
10
microM
,
if
needed
.

A
few
compounds
,
17alpha-methyltestosterone
(
17alpha-MT
)
,
vinclozolin
and
linuron
,
were
studied
using
a
real
world
scenario
,
i
.

e
.

,
assuming
that
their
interaction
with
the
AR
was
not
known
:
A
prescreening
for
agonism
and
true
,
competitive
antagonism
was
used
to
select
conditions
such
as
the
appropriate
mode
of
action
,
and
the
working
range
excluding
cytotoxicity
for
the
final
screening
.

All
other
compounds
were
tested
according
to
the
generic
protocol
:
Compounds
screened
for
agonism
were
the
reference
androgen
17alpha-methyldihydrotestosterone
(
MDHT
)
,
levonorgestrel
,
norethynodrel
,
progesterone
,
o
,
p'-DDT
,
and
dibutylphthalate
(
DBP
)
,
while
compounds
screened
for
antagonism
were
the
reference
anti-androgen
flutamide
,
prochloraz
,
o
,
p'-DDT
,
progesterone
,
norethynodrel
,
and
DBP
.

Cytotoxicity
was
assessed
in
parallel
as
lactate
dehydrogenase
release
.

The
prescreen
classified
17alpha-MT
as
androgenic
,
vinclozolin
and
linuron
as
anti-androgenic
and
compounds
were
tested
accordingly
.

In
the
absence
of
cytotoxicity
,
appropriate
androgenic
properties
of
reference
and
test
compounds
were
detected
by
both
laboratories
,
o
,
p'-DDT
and
DBP
had
no
androgenic
activity
.

Across
the
two
laboratories
EC
(
50
)
-values
for
MDHT
,
17alpha-MT
,
and
levonorgestrel
varied
by
not
more
than
a
factor
of
3
.
4
,
for
norethynodrel
by
a
factor
of
9
.
7
.

Progesterone
effects
could
not
fully
be
evaluated
,
as
frequently
concentration
response
curves
were
incomplete
.

In
the
absence
of
cytotoxicity
anti-androgenic
properties
of
reference
and
test
compounds
were
also
detected
in
both
laboratories
.

DBP
,
the
putative
negative
reference
compound
,
was
inactive
,
norethynodrel
rather
showed
agonistic
properties
.

Progesterone
was
an
antagonist
at
low
concentrations
,
but
agonistic
properties
were
observed
in
one
laboratory
at
high
concentrations
.

Since
the
highest
test
concentration
was
limited
to
10
microM
,
for
some
compounds
no
complete
concentration
response
curves
were
obtained
and
estimation
of
EC
(
50
)
-values
was
less
robust
.

Our
data
demonstrated
that
the
SOP
was
transferable
,
and
that
the
assay
was
able
to
rank
compounds
with
strong
,
weak
,
and
without
affinity
for
the
AR
and
to
discriminate
agonists
and
antagonists
.

The
sensitivity
of
the
assay
could
be
improved
further
,
if
the
limit
of
solubility
or
beginning
cytotoxicity
was
chosen
as
the
highest
test
concentration
.

The
assay
avoids
the
use
of
tissues
from
laboratory
animals
,
and
thus
contributes
to
the
3R
concept
.

Furthermore
,
it
could
be
adjusted
to
an
intermediate
/
high
throughput
format
.

On
the
whole
,
this
PALM
assay
is
a
promising
candidate
for
further
validation

The

Previously
,
we

that

,
a

,
inhibits
vascular

)
-mediated
angiogenesis
signaling
in

.

During
our
continuous
efforts
to
identify
more
potent
anti-angiogenic
agents
,
we
synthesized
various
nicotinamide
derivatives
and
evaluated
their
anti-angiogenic
effects
.

We
found
that

,

,
and
microvessel

in
a
concentration
range
of
10-100
nM
.

Furthermore
,
BRN-250
inhibited
the
VEGF-induced
phosphorylation
and
intracellular
tyrosine
kinase
activity
of
VEGF
receptor
2
(
VEGFR2
)
and
the
activation
of
its
downstream
AKT

.

Taken
together
,
these
findings
suggest
that
BRN-250
be
considered
a
potential
lead
compound
for
cancer

.
In
the
present
study
,
we
aimed
to
examine
the
effect
of
blockade
of
L-type
Ca
(

)
channels
(
LTCC
)
and
in
addition
the
removal
of
extracellular
Ca
(

)
,
on
EFS-induced
relaxations
in
rings
of
rat
mesenteric
artery
.

EFS
applied
to
the
tissues
precontracted
with
phenylephrine
caused
relaxations
which
were
markedly
inhibited
by
nifedipine
(
10
(

)
and
tetraethylammonium

.

Addition
of
LTCC
opener
BAY
K

(

)
failed
to
enhance
the
relaxations
.

Upon
removal
of
Ca
(
2

)
,
EFS
with
the
same
stimulation
parameters
produced
frequency-dependent
transient
contractions
.

Tetrodotoxin

)
,
capsaicin

and
removal
of
endothelium
did
not
alter
these
contractions
suggesting
that
they
were
not
neural
in
origin
and
endothelium-derived
contracting
factors
were
unlikely
to
be
involved
.

However
,
they
were
increased
by
nearly
40%
in
response
to
BAY
K
8644
(
10
(
-7
)
M
)
and
were
inhibited
by
nifedipine
(
10
(
-7

M
)
,
indicating
that
activation
of
the
LTCCs
was
essential
.

Inositol

)
significantly
reduced
,
and
high
concentration
of
caffeine
(
20mM
)
almost
totally
suppressed
the
contractions
.

These
results
suggest
that
in
the
absence
of
extracellular
Ca
(
2
+
)
EFS
through
membrane
depolarization
,
evokes
the
opening
of
the
LTCCs
which
subsequently
leads
to
the
release
of
Ca
(
2

)
from
internal
stores
via
InsP3
receptors
,
a
phenomenon
known
as
Ca
(
2
+
)
channel-induced
Ca
(
2
+
)
release
(
CCICR
)
,
to
trigger
vasoconstriction
.

That
activation
of
LTCCs
causes
arterial
relaxation
or
contraction
depending
on
the
Ca
(
2
+
)
status
apparently
exemplifies
how
the
same
messenger
fulfils
opposing
physiological
functions
in
a

The

H
(

antagonist
cetirizine
(

)
is
a
racemic
mixture
of
levocetirizine
(
now
available
under
the
trademark
Xyzal
and
dextrocetirizine
.

In
this
Commentary
,
we
examine
some
biological
properties
of
cetirizine
and
levocetirizine
,
namely
enantioselectivity
in
pharmacological
activity
and
pharmacokinetic
properties
,
with
emphasis
on
the
possibility
of
racemization
,
the
compared
behavior
of
the
two
enantiomers
,
and
the
potential
for
interactions
with
other
drugs
.

Recent
data
demonstrate
that
the
antihistaminergic
activity
of
the
racemate
is
primarily
due
to
levocetirizine
.

Levocetirizine
is
rapidly
and
extensively
absorbed
,
poorly
metabolized
,
and
not
subject
to
racemization
.

Its
pharmacokinetic
characteristics
are
comparable
after
administration
alone
or
in
the
racemate
.

Its
apparent
volume
of
distribution
is
smaller
than
that
of
dextrocetirizine
(

(

vs

)
.

Moreover
,
the
non-renal
(
mostly
hepatic
)
clearance
of
levocetirizine
is
also
significantly
lower
than
that
of
dextrocetirizine

Our
conclusion
is
that
levocetirizine
is
indeed
the
eutomer
of
cetirizine
.

The
evidence
reviewed
here
confirms
preclinical
findings
and
offers
a
rationale
for
the

Though
long-term
exposure
to
nicotine
is
highly
addictive
,
one
"beneficial"
consequence
of
chronic
tobacco
use
is
a
reduced
risk
for
Parkinson's
disease
.

Interestingly
,
these
effects
both
reflect
structural
and
functional
plasticity
of
brain
circuits
controlling
reward
and
motor
behavior
,
and
specifically
recruitment
of
nicotinic
acetylcholine
receptors
(
nAChR
)
in
mesencephalic
dopaminergic
neurons
.

Since
the
underlying
cellular
mechanisms
are
poorly
understood
,
we
addressed
this
issue
employing
primary
cultures
of
mouse
mesencephalic
dopaminergic
neurons
.

Exposure
to
nicotine
(
1-10
μM
)
for
72
hr
in
vitro
increased
dendritic
arborization
and
soma
size
in
primary
cultures
.

These
effects
were
blocked
by
mecamylamine
and
dihydro-β-erythroidine
,
but
not
methyllycaconitine
.

The
involvement
of
α4β2
nAChR
was
supported
by
the
lack
of
nicotine-induced
structural
remodeling
in
neurons
from
α4
null
mutant
mice
(
KO
)
.

Challenge
with
nicotine
triggered
phosphorylation
of
the
extracellular
signal-regulated
kinase
(
ERK
)
and
the
thymoma
viral
proto-oncogene
(
Akt
)
followed
by
activation
of
the
mTORC1-dependent
p70
ribosomal
S6
protein
kinase
.

Upstream
pathway
blockade
using
the
phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase
inhibitor
LY294002
resulted
in
suppression
of
nicotine-induced
phosphorylations
and
structural
plasticity
.

These
effects
were
dependent
upon
functional
DA
D3
receptor
(
D3R
)
since
nicotine
was
inactive
both
in
cultures
from
D3R
KO
mice
and
following
pharmacologic
blockade
with
D3R
antagonist
SB-277011-A
(
50
nM
)
.

Finally
,
exposure
to
nicotine
in
utero
(
5
mg
/
kg
/
day
for
5
days
)
resulted
in
increased
soma
area
of
DAergic
neurons
of
newborn
mice
,
effects
not
observed
in
D3KO
mice
.

These
findings
indicate
that
nicotine-induced
structural
plasticity
in
mesencephalic
dopaminergic
neurons
involves
α4β2
nAChRs
together
with
dopamine
D3R-mediated
recruitment
of

signaling

The

to
evaluate
the
effects

(
including
fusion
and
fission
proteins
)
,
fragmentation
,
and
distribution
of

in

of
the
rat
brain
in
an
attempt
to
elucidate
molecular
mechanisms
underlying
the
brain
damage
associated
with
excess
accumulation
of
fluoride
.

Sixty
Sprague-Dawley
rats
were
divided
randomly
into
three
groups
of
20
each
,
that
is
,
the
untreated
control
group
(
drinking
water
naturally
containing
<0

)
,
the
low-fluoride
group
(
whose
drinking
water
was
supplemented
with
10
mg
fluoride
/
l
)
and
the
high-fluoride
group
(
50
mg
fluoride
/
l
)
.

After
6
months
of
exposure
,
the
expression
of
mitofusin-1
(
Mfn1
)
,
fission-1
(
Fis1
)
,
and
dynamin-related
protein-1
(
Drp1
)
at
both
the
protein
and
mRNA
levels
were
detected
by
Western
blotting
,
immunohistochemistry
,
and
real-time
PCR
,
respectively
.

Moreover
,
mitochondrial
morphology
and
distribution
in
neurons
were
observed
by
transmission
electron
or
fluorescence
microscopy
.

In
the
cortices
of
the
brains
of
rats
with
chronic
fluorosis
,
the
level
of
Mfn1
protein
was
clearly
reduced
,
whereas
the
levels
of
Fis1
and
Drp1
were
elevated
.

The
alternations
of
expression
of
the
mRNAs
encoding
all
three
of
these
proteins
were
almost
the
same
as
the
corresponding
changes
at
the
protein
levels
.

The
mitochondria
were
fragmented
and
the
redistributed
away
from
the
axons
of
the
cortical
neurons
.

These
findings
indicate
that
chronic
fluorosis
induces
abnormal
mitochondrial
dynamics
,
which
might
in
turn
result
in
a
high
level
of
oxidative
stress
.
The
norepinephrine
(
NET
)
and
dopamine
(
DAT
)
transporters
are
highly
homologous
proteins
,
displaying
many
pharmacological
similarities
.

Both
transport
dopamine
with
higher
affinity
than
norepinephrine
and
are
targets
for
the
psychostimulants
cocaine
and
amphetamine
.

However
,
they
strikingly
contrast
in
their
affinities
for
tricyclic
antidepressants
(
TCA
)
.

Previous
studies
,
based
on
chimeric
proteins
between
DAT
and
NET
suggest
that
domains
ranging
from
putative
transmembrane
domain
(
TMD
)
5
to
8
are
involved
in
the
high
affinity
binding
of
TCA
to
NET
.

We
substituted
24
amino
acids
within
this
region
in
the
human
NET
with
their
counterparts
in
the
human
DAT
,
resulting
in
22
different
mutants
.

Mutations
of
residues
located
in
extra-
or
intracytoplasmic
loops
have
no
effect
on
binding
affinity
of
neither
TCA
nor
cocaine
.

Three
point
mutations
in
TMD6
(
F316C
)
,
-7
(
V356S
)
,
and
-8
(
G400L
)
induced
a
loss
of
TCA
binding
affinity
of
8-
,
5-
,
and
4-fold
,
respectively
,
without
affecting
the
affinity
of
cocaine
.

The
triple
mutation
F316C
/
V356S
/
G400L
produced
a
40-fold
shift
in
desipramine
affinity
.

These
three
residues
are
strongly
conserved
in
all
TCA-sensitive
transporters
cloned
in
mammalian
and
nonmammalian
species
.

A
strong
shift
in
TCA
affinity
(
IC
(
50
)
)
was
also
observed
for
double
mutants
F316C
/
D336T
(
35-fold
)
and
S399P
/
G400L
(
80-fold
for
nortriptyline
and
1000-fold
for
desipramine
)
.

Reverse
mutations
P401S
/
L402G
in
hDAT
did
not
elicit
any
gain
in
TCA
affinities
,
whereas
C318F
and
S358V
resulted
in
a
3-
and
10-fold
increase
in
affinity
,
respectively
.

Our
results
clearly
indicate
that
two
residues
located
in
TMD6
and
-7
of
hNET
may
play
an
important
role
in
TCA
interaction
and
that
a
critical
region
in
TMD8
is
likely
to
be
involved
in
the
tertiary
structure
allowing
the
high
affinity
binding
of
TCA
.

Cisplatin
(
CP
)
is
a
widely
used
anticancer
drug;
however
,
it
has
several
side
effects
such
as
nephrotoxicity
.

Ginger
,
the
rhizome
of
Zingiber
officinale
,
consumed
since
ancient
times
has
numerous
health
benefits
.

The
objective
of
this
work
was
to
evaluate
the
protective
effect
of
ginger
extract
(
GE
)
against
CP-induced
nephrotoxicity
.

CP
group
displayed
a
marked
renal
failure
characterized
by
a
significant
increase
in
serum
creatinine
and
blood
urea
nitrogen
(
BUN
)
levels
in
addition
to
severe
histopathological
and
ultrastructural
renal
alterations
.

Also
,
CP
group
showed
an
increase
in
the
immunohistochemical
expression
of
Bax
proapoptotic
protein
.

In
contrast
,
GE
+
CP
group
showed
significant
decrease
in
the
elevated
serum
creatinine
and
BUN
levels
and
an
improvement
in
the
histopathological
and
ultrastructural
renal
injury
induced
by
CP
.

The
overexpression
of
Bax
proapoptotic
protein
was
significantly
decreased
in
the
GE
+
CP
group
.

Hence
,
the
present
results
indicated
that
GE
has
a
protective
effect
against
CP-induced
renal
damage
in
rats
.

Thereby
,
such
findings
recommended
the
usage
of
GE
to
prevent
and
/
or
decrease
the
renal
damage
induced
by
CP
chemotherapeutic
treatment
.
Diacylglycerol
(
DAG
)
rich
oils
have
an
organoleptic
property
like
that
of
regular
edible
oils
,
but
these
oils
do
not
tend
to
be
accumulated
as
fat
.

Palm
oil
ranks
first
in
the
world
in
terms
of
edible
oil
production
owing
to
its
low
cost
.

The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
propose
a
new
methodology
to
produce
diacylglycerol
by
hydrolysis
of
palm
oil
using
Lipozyme
RM
IM
commercial
lipase
as
a
catalyst
under
ultrasound
irradiation
.

The
reactions
were
carried
out
at
55
°C
with
two
different
methods
.

First
,
the
reaction
system
was
exposed
to
ultrasonic
waves
for
the
whole
reaction
time
,
which
led
to
enzymatic
inactivation
and
water
evaporation
.

Ultrasound
was
then
used
to
promote
emulsification
of
the
water
/
oil
system
before
the
hydrolysis
reaction
,
avoiding
contact
between
the
probe
and
the
enzymes
.

An
experimental
design
was
used
to
optimize
the
ultrasound-related
parameters
and
maximize
the
hydrolysis
rate
,
and
in
these
conditions
,
with
a
change
in
equilibrium
,
DAG
production
was
evaluated
.

Better
reaction
conditions
were
achieved
for
the
second

S-Nitrosothiols

)
-mediated
S-nitrosylation
,
and
hydrogen
peroxide
(
H2O2
)
,
a
prominent
reactive
oxygen
species
,
are
implicated
in
diverse
physiological
and
pathological
processes
.

Recent
research
has
shown
that
the
cellular
action
and
metabolism
of
SNOs
and
H2O2
involve
overlapping
,
thiol-based
mechanisms
,
but
how
these
reactive
species
may
affect
each
other's
fate
and
function
is
not
well
understood
.

In
this
study
we
investigated
how
NO
/
SNO
may
affect
the
redox
cycle
of
mammalian
peroxiredoxin-1
(
Prx1
)
,
a
representative
of
the
2-Cys
Prxs
,
a
group
of
thioredoxin
(
Trx
)
-dependent
peroxidases
.

We
found
that
,
both
in
a
cell-free
system
and
in
cells
,
NO
/
SNO
donors
such
as
S-nitrosocysteine
and
S-nitrosoglutathione
readily
induced
the
S-nitrosylation
of
Prx1
,
causing
structural
and
functional
alterations
.

In
particular
,
nitrosylation
promoted
disulfide
formation
involving
the
pair
of
catalytic
cysteines
(
Cys-52
and
Cys-173
)
and
disrupted
the
oligomeric
structure
of
Prx1
,
leading
to
loss
of
peroxidase
activity
.

A
highly
potent
inhibition
of
the
peroxidase
catalytic
reaction
by
NO
/
SNO
was
seen
in
assays
employing
the
coupled
Prx-Trx
system
.

In
this
setting
,
S-nitrosocysteine
(
10
μm
)
effectively
blocked
the
Trx-mediated
regeneration
of
oxidized
Prx1
.

This
effect
appeared
to
be
due
to
both
competition
between
S-nitrosocysteine
and
Prx1
for
the
Trx
system
and
direct
modulation
by
S-nitrosocysteine
of
Trx
reductase
activity
.

Our
findings
that
NO
/
SNO
target
both
Prx
and
Trx
reductase
may
have
implications
for
understanding
the
impact
of
nitrosylation
on
cellular
redox
homeostasis

The
intron
/
exon
organization
of
the
Drosophila
gene
reveals
the
presence
of
six
exons
among
which
four
are
in
the
5'-end
encoding
glutamic
acid
activity
.

Only
one
exon
encodes
the
repeated
motifs
.

A

of
introns
positions
,
intron
classes
and

/

boundaries
in
the
Drosophila
gene
and
in
its
human
counterpart
is
compatible
with
the
intron-early
hypothesis
presiding
,
at
least
in
part
,
to
the
evolution
of
the
synthetases
.

The
full-length
fly
protein
is
encoded
by
a
6
.
1-kb
mRNA
which
is
expressed
throughout
development
.

In
addition
,
a
shorter
transcript
encompasses
the
3'-end
of
the
cDNA
and
it
is
especially
abundant
in
5-10-h
embryos
until
the
first
larval
stage
.

Expression
of
these
two
mRNAs
seems
to
be
controlled
by
two
independent
promoters
.

The
6
.
1-kb
mRNA
promoter
is
probably
localized
in
the
5'-end
of
the
gene
.

The
small
mRNA
promoter
resides
in
the
4th
intron
and
evidence
is
provided
that
the
mRNA
encodes
only
the
domain
corresponding
to
prolyl-tRNA
synthetase
and
is
functional
in
vivo
.

Finally
,
transgenic
flies
have
been
established
by
using
constructs
corresponding
to
the
three
domains
of
the
protein
.

Overexpression
of
the
repeated
motifs
leads
to
a
sterility
of
the
flies
that
suggests
a
role
of
these
motifs
in
linking
the
multienzyme
complex
to
an
,
as
yet
,
unknown
structure
of
the
protein

Alternative

(

is
one
of
the
most

of
the
functional
complexity
of
human
UDP-glucuronosyltransferase
enzymes
(
UGTs
)
,
particularly
for
the
UGT1A
gene
,
which
represents
one
of
the
best
examples
of
a
drug-metabolizing
gene
regulated
by
AS
.

Shorter
UGT1A
isoforms
[
isoform
2
(
i2
)
]
are
deficient
in
glucuronic
acid
transferase
activity
but
function
as
negative
regulators
of
enzyme
activity
through
protein-protein
interaction
.

Their
abundance
,
relative
to
active
UGT1A
enzymes
,
is
expected
to
be
a
determinant
of
the
global
transferase
activity
of
cells
and
tissues
.

Here
we
tested
whether
i2-mediated
inhibition
increases
with
greater
abundance
of
the
i2
protein
relative
to
the
isoform
1
(
i1
)
enzyme

.

Upon
normalization
for

,
a
significant
reduction
of
7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin
glucuronide
formation
was
observed
for
i1
+
i2
clones
(
mean
of
53%
)
compared
with
the
reference
i1
cell
line
.

In
these
clones
,
the
i2
protein
content
varied
greatly
(
38-263%
relative
to
i1
)
and
revealed
two
groups
:
17
clones
with
i2
<
i1
(
60%
±
3%
)
and
6
clones
with
i2
≥
i1
(
153%
±
24%
)
.

The
inhibition
induced
by
i2
was
more
substantial
for
clones
displaying
i2
≥
i1
(

)
compared
with
those
with

.

Coimmunoprecipitation
supports
a
more
substantial
i1-i2
complex
formation
when
i2
exceeds
i1
.

We
conclude
that
the
relative
abundance
of
regulatory
i2
proteins
has
the
potential
to
drastically
alter
the
local
drug
metabolism
in

INTRODUCTION
:
It
is
well
known
that
numerous
mechanisms
of
thrombogenesis
can
participate
in
every
stage
of
atherosclerotic
disease
.

The
discovery
of
Lp
(
a
)
lipoprotein
and
its
structural
similarity
with
plasminogen
suggests
another
pathogenic
link
between
atherogenesis
and
thrombogenesis
.

SOME
CHARACTERISTICS
OF
LP
(
A
)
LIPOPROTEIN
:
This
lipoprotein
is
present
in
the
whole
human
population
in
a
wide
range
of
plasma
concentrations
.

It
has
numerous
different
isoforms
.

Its
synthesis
occurs
in
the
liver
,
but
it
is
practically
metabolically
independent
from
other
lipoproteins
.

Today
,
Lp
(
a
)
lipoprotein
is
considered
to
be
an
independent
risk
factor
for
heart
and
brain
ischemic
disease
.

FIBRINOLYTIC
MECHANISMS
:
The
primary
role
of
the
fibrinolytic
mechanism
is
to
prevent
thrombus
Jormation
during
circulation
and
to
remove
already
formed
ones
.

Plasmin
has
a
central
role
in
this
process
,
due
to
the
inactive
proenzyme
plasminogen
.

Its
basic
activators
are
tissue-type
plasminogen
activator
(
t-PA
)
and
urokinase
plasminogen
activator
(
u-PA
)
.

The
most
important
inhibitors
of
plasminogen
are
alpha2-antiplasmin
and
plasminogen
activator
inhibitors
1
and
2
(
PA-1
and
PAI-2
)
.

Structural
similarity
of
Lp
(
a
)
and
plasminogen
The
apo
(
a
)
and
plasminogen
genes
are
very
closely
linked
on
the
long
arm
of
chromosome
6
.

Because
of
that
they
are
structuraly
very
similar
and
they
have
a
cross
immunological
reactivity
.

Their
common
elements
are
so-called
"kringle"
structures
.

The
key
difference
in
structure
of
Lp
(
a
)
and
plasminogen
is
replacement
of
Arg
with
Ser
at
position
560
.

This
prevents
splitting
of
apo
(
a
)
by
plasminogen
activators
.

LP
(
A
)
AND
FIBRINOLYSIS
:
Lp
(
a
)
lipoprotein
inhibits
activation
of
plasminogen
by
streptokinase
.

It
is
also
a
competitive
inhibitor
of
plasminogen
for
its
binding
to
plasminogen
receptors
.

Furthermore
,
it
successfully
achieves
competitive
inhibition
of
plasminogen
for
binding
to
tetranectin
and
thrombospondin
.

Also
,
Lp
(
a
)
inhibits
activation
of
transforming
growth
factor
alpha
(
TGF-alpha
)
.

It
positively
correlates
with
PAI-1
and
it
is
assumed
that
it
promotes
release
of
tissue
factor
pathway
inhibitor
(
17FPI
)
from
endothelial
cell
surfaces
.

We
have
synthesized
a
β-cyclodextrin
(
βCD
)
-capped
histone
deacetylase
(
HDAC
)
inhibitor
3
containing
an
alkyl
linker
and
a
zinc-binding
hydroxamic
acid
motif
.

Biological
evaluation
(
HDAC
inhibition
studies
)
of
3
enabled
us
to
establish
the
effect
of
replacing
an
aryl
cap
(
in
SAHA
(
vorinostat
,
)
)
1
by
a
large
saccharidic
scaffold
"cap"
.

HDAC
inhibition
was
observed
for
3
,
to
a
lesser
extent
than
SAHA
,
and
rationalized
by
molecular
docking
into
the
active
site
of
HDAC8
.

However
,
compound
3
displayed
no
cellular
activity
.
Cells
respond
to
physiological
stress
by
phosphorylating
the
alpha
subunit
of
the
translation
initiation
factor
eIF2
.

This
adaptive
response
inhibits
protein
synthesis
and
up-regulates
genes
essential
for
cell
survival
.

Cat-1
,
the
transporter
for
the
essential
amino
acids
,
arginine
and
lysine
,
is
one
of
the
up-regulated
genes
.

We
previously
showed
that
stress
increases
cat-1
expression
by
coordinated
stabilization
of
the
mRNA
and
increased
mRNA
translation
.

This
induction
is
triggered
by
amino
acid
depletion
and
the
unfolded
protein
response
(
UPR
)
,
which
is
caused
by
unfolded
proteins
in
the
endoplasmic
reticulum
.

We
show
here
that
cat-1
gene
transcription
is
also
increased
by
cellular
stress
.

Our
studies
demonstrate
that
the
cat-1
gene
promoter
/
regulatory
region
is
TATA-less
and
is
located
in
a
region
that
includes
94
bases
of
the
first
exon
.

Transcription
from
this
promoter
is
stimulated
8-fold
by
cellular
stress
.

An
amino
acid
response
element
within
the
first
exon
is
shown
to
be
required
for
the
response
to
amino
acid
depletion
but
not
to
the
UPR
.

The
stimulation
of
transcription
by
amino
acid
depletion
requires
activation
of
GCN2
kinase
,
which
phosphorylates
eIF2alpha
.

This
phosphorylation
also
induces
translation
of
the
cat-1
mRNA
,
demonstrating
that
stress-induced
transcriptional
and
translational
control
of
cat-1
are
downstream
targets
of
a
signaling
pathway
initiating
with
eIF2alpha
phosphorylation
.

Our
studies
show
that
the
increase
in
cat-1
gene
expression
by
cellular
stress
involves
at
least
three
types
of
coordinate
regulation
:
regulation
of
transcription
,
regulation
of
mRNA
stability
,
and
regulation
of
mRNA
translation
.
We
have
previously
shown
that
retinoic
acid
(
RA
)
synthesized
by
the
retinaldehyde
dehydrogenase
2
(
RALDH2
)
is
required
in
forebrain
development
.

Deficiency
in
RA
due
to
inactivation
of
the
mouse
Raldh2
gene
or
to
complete
absence
of
retinoids
in
vitamin-A-deficient
(
VAD
)
quails
,
leads
to
abnormal
morphogenesis
of
various
forebrain
derivatives
.

In
this
study
we
show
that
double
Raldh2
/
Raldh3
mouse
mutants
have
a
more
severe
phenotype
in
the
craniofacial
region
than
single
null
mutants
.

In
particular
,
the
nasal
processes
are
truncated
and
the
eye
abnormalities
are
exacerbated
.

It
has
been
previously
shown
that
retinoids
act
mainly
on
cell
proliferation
and
survival
in
the
ventral
forebrain
by
regulating
SHH
and
FGF8
signaling
.

Using
the
VAD
quail
model
,
which
survives
longer
than
the
Raldh-deficient
mouse
embryos
,
we
found
that
retinoids
act
in
maintaining
the
correct
position
of
anterior
and
dorsal
boundaries
in
the
forebrain
by
modulating
FGF8
anteriorly
and
WNT
signaling
dorsally
.

Furthermore
,
BMP4
and
FGF8
signaling
are
affected
in
the
nasal
region
and
BMP4
is
ventrally
expanded
in
the
optic
vesicle
.

At
the
optic
cup
stage
,
Pax6
,
Tbx5
and
Bmp4
are
ectopically
expressed
in
the
presumptive
retinal
pigmented
epithelium
(
RPE
)
,
while
Otx2
and
Mitf
are
not
induced
,
leading
to
a
dorsal
transdifferentiation
of
RPE
to
neural
retina
.

Therefore
,
besides
being
required
for
survival
of
ventral
structures
,
retinoids
are
involved
in
restricting
anterior
identity
in
the
telencephalon
and
dorsal
identity
in
the
diencephalon
and
the
retina
.

There
has
been
much
recent
interest
in
lysophosphatidic
acid
(
LPA
)
signaling
through
one
of
its
receptors
,
LPA1
,
in
fibrotic
diseases
,
but
the
mechanisms
by
which
LPA-LPA1
signaling
promotes
pathological
fibrosis
remain
to
be
fully
elucidated
.

Using
a
mouse
peritoneal
fibrosis
model
,
we
demonstrate
central
roles
for
LPA
and
LPA1
in
fibroblast
proliferation
.

Genetic
deletion
or
pharmacological
antagonism
of
LPA1
protected
mice
from
peritoneal
fibrosis
,
blunting
the
increases
in
peritoneal
collagen
by

4
and
52
.
9%
,
respectively
,
compared
to
control
animals
and
demonstrated
that
peritoneal
fibroblast
proliferation
was
highly
LPA1
dependent
.

Activation
of
LPA1
on
mesothelial
cells
induced
these
cells
to
express
connective
tissue
growth
factor
(
CTGF
)
,
driving
fibroblast
proliferation
in
a
paracrine
fashion
.

Activation
of
mesothelial
cell
LPA1
induced
CTGF
expression
by
inducing
cytoskeleton
reorganization
in
these
cells
,
causing
nuclear
translocation
of
myocardin-related
transcription
factor
(
MRTF
)
-A
and
MRTF-B
.

Pharmacological
inhibition
of
MRTF-induced
transcription
also
diminished
CTGF
expression
and
fibrosis
in
the
peritoneal
fibrosis
model
,
mitigating
the
increase
in
peritoneal
collagen
content
by
57
.
9%
compared
to
controls
.

LPA1-induced
cytoskeleton
reorganization
therefore
makes
a
previously
unrecognized
but
critically
important
contribution
to
the
profibrotic
activities
of
LPA
by
driving
MRTF-dependent
CTGF
expression
,
which
,
in
turn
,
drives
fibroblast
proliferation
.

The
testis-specific

kinases
(
TSSKs
)
comprise
a
family
of
post-meiotic
kinases
expressed
in
spermatids
,
are
critical
to
spermiogenesis
and
are
required
for
male
fertility
in
mammals
.

To
explore
the
role
of
HSP90
in
regulation
of
TSSKs
,
the
stability
and
catalytic
activity
of
epitope-tagged
murine
TSSKs
were
assessed
in
293T
and
COS-7
cells
.

TSSK1
,
2
,
4
,
and
6
(
SSTK
)
were
all
found
to
associate
with
HSP90
and
pharmacological
inhibition
of
HSP90
function
using
the
highly
specific
drugs
17-AAG
,
SNX-5422
,
or
NVP-AUY922
reduced
TSSK
protein
levels
in
cells
.

The
attenuation
of
HSP90
function
abolished
the
catalytic
activities
of
TSSK4
and
6
,
but
did
not
significantly
alter
the
specific
activities
of
TSSK1
and
2
.

Inhibition
of
HSP90
resulted
in
increased
TSSK
ubiquitination
and
proteasomal
degradation
indicating
that
HSP90
acts
to
control
ubiquitin-mediated
catabolism
of
the
TSSKs
.

To
study
HSP90
and
TSSKs
in
germ
cells
a
mouse
primary
spermatid
culture
model
was
developed
and
characterized
.

Using
specific
antibodies
against
murine
TSSK2
and
6
,
it
was
demonstrated
that
HSP90
inhibition
resulted
in
a
marked
decrease
of
the
endogenous
kinases
in
spermatids
.

Together
,
our
findings
demonstrate
that
HSP90
plays
a
broad
and
critical
role
in
stabilization
and
activation
of
the
TSSK
family
of
protein
kinases

identified

include

An

includes

CED-3
and

,
along
with
their
mammalian

,
function
to
kill
cells
,
whereas
CED-9
and
its
mammalian

protect
cells
from

.

These
central
components
biochemically
intermingle
in
a

complex
recently
dubbed
the
"apoptosome

"
The
C

protein
EGL-1
and
its
mammalian
counterparts
,
pro-apoptotic
members
of
the
bcl-2
family
,
induce
cell
death
by
disrupting
apoptosome
interactions
.

Thus
,
EGL-1
may
represent
a
primordial
signal
integrator
for
the
apoptosome
.

Various
biochemical
processes
including
oligomerization
,
adenosine
triphosphate
ATP
/
dATP
binding
,
and
cytochrome
c
interaction
play
a
role
in
regulating
the
ternary
death
complex
.

Recent
studies
suggest
that
cell
death
receptors
,
such
as
CD95
,
may
amplify
their
suicide
signal
by
activating
the
apoptosome
.

These
mutual
associations
by
core
components
of
the
suicide
apparatus
provide
a
molecular
framework
in
which
diverse
death
signals
likely
interface
.

Understanding
the
apoptosome
and
its
cellular
connections
will
facilitate
the
design

novel

Oestrogen

Ever
since
the
discovery
that
(

)
-5
,
6
,
7
,
8-tetrahydro-L-biopterin
(
BH4
)
is
a
cofactor
of
NOS
,
its
function
has
been
the
object
of
intense
research
and
occasional
controversy
.

Only
in
the
last
couple
of
years
a
consensus
has
been
reached
on
what
constitutes
the
main
role
of
BH4
in
NO
synthesis
.

In
this
review
we
aim
to
provide
an
outline
of
the
various
ways
in
which
BH4
affects
NOS
catalysis
.

First
we
give
a
brief
general
description
of
the
structure
and
catalytic
mechanism
of
NOS
,
with
special
emphasis
on
those
aspects
of
catalysis
that
are
actively
debated
,
and
that
directly
or
indirectly
involve
BH4
.

Foremost
among
those
issues
is
uncoupled
catalysis
,
i
.

e
.

the
NOS-catalyzed
oxidation
of
NADPH
in
the
absence
of
substrate
or
pterin
that
does
not
result
in
NO
production
.

We
also
shortly
discuss
the
ongoing
debate
on
whether
NO
is
the
actual
reaction
product
of
NOS
catalysis
,
as
well
as
the
phenomenon
of
NO-mediated
autoinhibition
.

We
describe
the
function
of
BH4
in
aromatic
amino
acid
hydroxylation
,
and
discuss
the
allosteric
and
structural
effects
that
BH4
exerts
on
NOS
.

Next
we
turn
our
attention
to
what
is
now
becoming
accepted
as
the
central
function
of
BH4
:
its
capacity
to
act
as
a
1-electron
donor
during
reductive
activation
of
the
oxyferrous
complex
of
the
heme
.

Finally
,
we
illustrate
how
BH4
might
transform
the
NOS
dimer
into
an
efficient
S-nitrosoglutathione
synthase
,
and
briefly
touch
on
some
more
speculative
aspects
of
the
role
of
BH4
in
NO
synthesis

two
high-affinity
,
imidazol
(

e-preferring
binding
sites
that
are
pharmacologically
distinct
from

adrenoceptors
.

These
nonadrenergic
sites
were
radiolabeled
even
in
the
presence
of
a
10
microM
norepinephrine
mask
of
alpha-2
adrenoceptors
.

Heterogeneity
at
the
nonadrenergic
sites
was
demonstrated
by
comparing
[
3H
]
idazoxan
(
IDX
)
binding
vs
.

[
125I
]
p-iodoclonidine
(
PIC

binding
.

Nonadrenergic
[
125I
]
PIC-labeled
sites
were
enriched
in
platelet
plasma
membranes
,
whereas
the
nonadrenergic
sites
labeled
by
[
3H
]
IDX
were
codistributed
between
plasma
and
internal
membranes
(
nonadrenergic
[
125I
]
PIC-labeled
sites
had
Bmax
=
62
fmol
/

in
plasma

and
20
fmol
/

in

vs
.

the
[
3H
]
IDX-labeled
sites
had
Bmax
=
141
fmol
/
mg
in
plasma
membranes
and
192
fmol
/
mg
in
internal
membranes
)
.

Furthermore
,
competition
binding
studies
in
the
presence
of
a
10
microM
norepinephrine
mask
revealed
major
(
approximately
75%
)
and
minor
(
approximately
25%
)
binding
components
on
plasma
membranes
for
[
125I
]
PIC
.

Affinities
for
the
major
nonadrenergic
[
125I
]
PIC
binding
site
were
highly
comparable
to
human
subtype-I1
imidazol
(
in
)
e
receptor
sites
in
the
brain
stem
(
rank
order
:
moxonidine
>
clonidine
>
cirazoline
>
IDX
>
amiloride
)
.

However
,
the
minor
component
of
[
125I
]
PIC
binding
was
similar
to
a
site
reported
in
kidney
,
having
low
affinities
for
all
compounds
tested
,
except
guanabenz
.

Finally
,
a
third
nonadrenergic
internal
membrane
site
,
labeled
by
[
3H
]
IDX
,
was
consistent
with
a
subtype-I2
imidazol
(
in
)
e
receptor
site
(
rank
order
:
cirazoline
>
IDX
>>
amiloride
>
moxonidine
>
clonidine
)
.

Thus
,
based
on
differential
subcellular
distributions
and
affinity
constants
,
human
platelets
appear
to
possess
imidazoline
receptors
(
subtype-I1
imidazol
(
in
)
e
receptor
and
subtype-I2
imidazol
(
in
)
e
receptor
)
,
plus
a
novel
guanabenz-sensitive
site
,
as
well
as
an
alpha-2A
adrenoceptor
.

These
nonadrenoceptor
binding
sites
may
explain
certain
novel
platelet
aggregatory
properties
previously
ascribed
to
clonidine
and
endogenous
clonidine-displacing
substance
(
s
)
,
and
may
serve
as
markers
of
imidazoline
receptors
in
humans
.

Impact

The
constitutive
androstane
receptor
(
CAR
)
not
only
displays
a
high
basal
transcriptional
activity
but
also
acts
as
a
ligand-dependent
transcriptional
factor
.

It
is
known
that
CAR
exhibits
different
ligand
profiles
across
species
.

However
,
the
mechanisms
underlying
CAR
activation
by
chemicals
and
the
species-specific
responses
are
not
fully
understood
.

The
objectives
of
this
study
are
to
establish
a
high-throughput
tool
to
screen
CAR
ligands
and
to
clarify
how
CAR
proteins
from
the
Baikal
seal
(
bsCAR
)
and
the
mouse
(
mCAR
)
interact
with
chemicals
and
steroid
receptor
coactivator
1
(
SRC1
)
.

We
developed
the
surface
plasmon
resonance
(
SPR
)
system
to
assess
quantitatively
the
interaction
of
CAR
with
potential
ligands
and
SRC1
.

The
ligand-binding
domain
(
LBD
)
of
bsCAR
and
mCAR
was
synthesized
in
a
wheat
germ
cell-free
system
.

The
purified
CAR
LBD
was
then
immobilized
on
the
sensor
chip
for
the
SPR
assay
,
and
the
kinetics
of
direct
interaction
of
CARs
with
ligand
candidates
was
measured
.

Androstanol
and
androstenol
,
estrone
,
17β-estradiol
,
TCPOBOP
,
and
CITCO
showed
compound-specific
but
similar
affinities
for
both
CARs
.

The
CAR-SRC1
interaction
was
ligand
dependent
but
exhibited
a
different
ligand
profile
between
the
seal
and
the
mouse
.

The
results
of
SRC1
interaction
assay
accounted
for
those
of
our
previous
in
vitro
CAR-mediated
transactivation
assay
.

In
silico
analyses
also
supported
the
results
of
CAR-SRC1
interaction;
there
is
little
structural
difference
in
the
ligand-binding
pocket
of
bsCAR
and
mCAR
,
but
there
is
a
distinct
discrimination
in
the
helix
11
and
12
of
these
receptors
,
suggesting
that
the
interaction
of
ligand-bound
CAR
and
SRC1
is
critical
for
determining
species-specific
and
ligand-dependent
transactivation
over
the
basal
activity
.

The
SPR
assays
demonstrated
a
potential
as
a
high-throughput
screening
tool
of
CAR
ligands
.
BACKGROUND
:
Airway
remodeling
and
dysfunction
are
characteristic
features
of
asthma
thought
to
be
caused
by
aberrant
production
of
Th2
cytokines
.

Histamine
H4
receptor
(
H4R
)
perturbation
has
previously
been
shown
to
modify
acute
inflammation
and
Th2
cytokine
production
in
a
murine
model
of
asthma
.

We
examined
the
ability
of
H4R
antagonists
to
therapeutically
modify
the
effects
of
Th2
cytokine
production
such
as
goblet
cell
hyperplasia
(
GCH
)
,
and
collagen
deposition
in
a
sub-chronic
model
of
asthma
.

In
addition
,
effects
on
Th2
mediated
lung
dysfunction
were
also
determined
.

METHODS
:
Mice
were
sensitized
to
ovalbumin
(
OVA
)
followed
by
repeated
airway
challenge
with
OVA
.

After
inflammation
was
established
mice
were
dosed
with
the
H4R
antagonist
,
JNJ
7777120
,
or
anti-IL-13
antibody
for
comparison
.

Airway
hyperreactivity
(
AHR
)
was
measured
,
lungs
lavaged
and
tissues
collected
for
analysis
.

RESULTS
:
Therapeutic
H4R
antagonism
inhibited
T
cell
infiltration
in
to
the
lung
and
decreased
Th2
cytokines
IL-13
and
IL-5
.

IL-13
dependent
remodeling
parameters
such
as
GCH
and
lung
collagen
were
reduced
.

Intervention
with
H4R
antagonist
also
improved
measures
of
central
and
peripheral
airway
dysfunction
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
These
data
demonstrate
that
therapeutic
H4R
antagonism
can
significantly
ameliorate
allergen
induced
,
Th2
cytokine
driven
pathologies
such
as
lung
remodeling
and
airway
dysfunction
.

The
ability
of
H4R
antagonists
to
affect
these
key
manifestations
of
asthma
suggests
their
potential
as
novel
human
therapeutics
.
Erectile
dysfunction
(
ED
)
is
usually
treated
with
sildenafil
.

Although
genetic
polymorphisms
in
the
endothelial
nitric
oxide
synthase
(
eNOS
)
gene
may
impair
endogenous
NO
formation
,
there
is
little
information
about
how
eNOS
polymorphisms
and
haplotypes
affect
the
responses
to
sildenafil
.

We
studied
118
patients;
63
patients
had
ED
secondary
to
radical
prostatectomy
(
PED
)
and
55
had
organic
,
clinical
ED
.

eNOS
genotypes
for
three
eNOS
polymorphisms
(
T
(
-786
)
C
,
rs2070744;
a
variable
number
of
tandem
repeats
(
VNTR
)
in
intron
4;
and
Glu298Asp
,
rs1799983
)
were
determined
,
and
eNOS
haplotypes
were
estimated
using
PHASE
2
.
1
.

The
clinical
responses
to
sildenafil
were
evaluated
and
the
patients
were
classified
as
good
responders
(
GR
)
or
poor
responders
(
PR
)
when
their
changes
in
five-item
version
of
International
Index
for
Erectile
Function
questionnaire
were
above
or
below
the
median
value
.

The
TC
/
CC
genotypes
and
the
C
allele
for
the
T
(
-786
)
C
polymorphism
were
more
common
in
GR
,
compared
with
PR
patients
with
PED
.

However
,
the
4b4a
/
4a4a
genotypes
and
the
4a
allele
for
the
VNTR
polymorphism
in
intron
4
were
more
common
in
GR
,
compared
with
PR
patients
with
clinical
ED
.

The
C-4a-Glu
haplotype
was
more
common
in
GR
than
in
PR
patients
with
PED
.

Conversely
,
the
T-4b-Asp
haplotype
was
less
common
in
GR
than
in
PR
patients
with
PED
.

No
other
significant
differences
were
found
.

Our
findings
show
evidence
that
eNOS
polymorphisms
affect
the
responses
of
PED
and
clinical
ED
patients
to
sildenafil
.
The
goal
of
this
study
was
to
monitor
the
anti-proliferative
activity
of
Rosmarinus
officinalis
and
Salvia
officinalis
extracts
against
cancer
cells
and
to
correlate
this
activity
with
their
phytochemical
profiles
using
liquid
chromatography
/
diode
array
detection
/
electrospray
ion
trap
tandem
mass
spectrometry
(
LC
/

/

(

)
.

For
the
quantitative
estimation
of
triterpenic
acids
in
the
crude
extracts
an
NMR
based
methodology
was
used
and
compared
with
the
HPLC
measurements
,
both
applied
for
the
first
time
,
for
the
case
of
betulinic
acid
.

Both
extracts
exerted
cytotoxic
activity
through
dose-dependent
impairment
of
viability
and
mitochondrial
activity
of
rat
insulinoma
m5F
(
RINm5F
)
cells
.

Decrease
of
RINm5F
viability
was
mediated
by
nitric
oxide
(
NO
)
-induced
apoptosis
.

Importantly
,
these
extracts
potentiated
NO
and
TNF-α
release
from
macrophages
therefore
enhancing
their
cytocidal
action
.

The
rosemary
extract
developed
more
pronounced
antioxidant
,
cytotoxic
and
immunomodifying
activities
,
probably
due
to
the
presence
of
betulinic
acid
and
a
higher
concentration
of
carnosic
acid
in
its
phytochemical
profile
.

4-Hydroxycoumarins
such
as
warfarin
1
have
been
the
mainstay
of
oral
anticoagulation
therapy
for
over
20
years
.

Yet
little
detail
is
known
about
the
molecular
interactions
between
4-hydroxycoumarins
with
vitamin
K
epoxide
reductase
(
VKER
)
,
inhibition
of
which
produces
a
deficiency
of
vitamin
K
and
consequently
a
deficiency
of
vitamin
K-dependent
proteins
involved
in
thrombus
formation
.

Using
molecular
probes
,
such
as
4-sulfhydrylwarfarin
7
and
4-chlorowarfarin
10
it
is
shown
in
vitro
that
inhibition
of
VKER
by
warfarin
is
dependent
on
deprotonation
of
the
4-hydroxycoumarin
moiety
.

In
addition
,
the
nature
of
the
substituent
on
carbon
3
of
the
4-hydroxycoumarin
modulated
inhibition
.

More
specifically
,
a
linear
isoprenyl
side
chain
increased
inhibition
of
VKER
when
compared
to
cyclical
substituents
as
present
in
warfarin
.

An
example
of
a
4-hydroxycoumarin
with
an
isoprenyl
side
chain
is
the
natural
product
ferulenol
19
derived
from
Ferula
communis
.

Ferulenol
19
confers
approximately
22
times
more
potent
inhibition
than
warfarin
and
is
approximately
1
.
5
more
potent
than
the
rodenticide
brodifacoum
in
this
in
vitro
assay
.

Based
on
these
data
it
is
hypothesized
that
4-hydroxycoumarins
bind
to
the
active
site
of
VKER
thereby
mimicking
the
transition
state
of
the
elimination
of
water
from
substrate

BACKGROUND
:
Nondepolarizing
neuromuscular
blocking
agents
(
NMBAs
)
are
extensively
used
in
the
practice
of
anesthesia
and
intensive
care
medicine
.

Their
primary
site
of
action
is
at
the
postsynaptic
nicotinic
acetylcholine
receptor
(
nAChR
)
in
the
neuromuscular
junction
,
but
their
action
on
neuronal
nAChRs
have
not
been
fully
evaluated
.

Furthermore
,
observed
adverse
effects
of
nondepolarizing
NMBAs
might
originate
from
an
interaction
with
neuronal
nAChRs
.

The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
examine
the
effect
of
clinically
used
nondepolarizing
NMBAs
on
muscle
and
neuronal
nAChR
subtypes
.

METHODS
:
Xenopus
laevis
oocytes
were
injected
with
messenger
RNA
encoding
for
the
subunits
included
in
the
human
alpha1beta1epsilondelta
,
alpha3beta2
,
alpha3beta4
,
alpha4beta2
,
and
alpha7
nAChR
subtypes
.

The
interactions
between
each
of
these
nAChR
subtypes
and
atracurium
,
cisatracurium
,
d-tubocurarine
,
mivacurium
,
pancuronium
,
rocuronium
,
and
vecuronium
were
studied
using
an
eight-channel
two-electrode
voltage
clamp
setup
.

Responses
were
measured
as
peak
current
and
net
charge
.

RESULTS
:
All
nondepolarizing
NMBAs
inhibited
both
muscle
and
neuronal
nAChRs
.

The
neuronal
nAChRs
were
reversibly
and
concentration-dependently
inhibited
in
the
low
micromolar
range
.

The
mechanism
(
i
.

e
.

,
competitive
vs
.

noncompetitive
)
of
the
block
at
the
neuronal
nAChRs
was
dependent
both
on
subtype
and
the
NMBA
tested
.

The
authors
did
not
observe
activation
of
the
nAChR
subtypes
by
any
of
the
NMBAs
tested
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
The
authors
conclude
that
nondepolarizing
NMBAs
concentration-dependently
inhibit
human
neuronal
nAChRs
.

The
inhibition
of
the
presynaptic
alpha3beta2
nAChR
subtype
expressed
at
the
motor
nerve
ending
provides
a
possible
molecular
explanation
for
the
tetanic
and
train-of-four
fade
seen
during
a
nondepolarizing
neuromuscular
block
.
Nerve
injury
induces
long-term
changes
in
gene
expression
in
the
nociceptive
circuitry
and
can
lead
to
chronic
neuropathic
pain
.

However
,
the
transcriptional
mechanism
involved
in
neuropathic
pain
is
poorly
understood
.

Nuclear
factor
of
activated
T-cells
(
NFATc
)
is
a
transcriptional
factor
regulated
by
the
Ca
(
2
+
)
-dependent
protein
phosphatase
calcineurin
.

In
this
study
,
we
determined
nerve
injury-induced
changes
in
the
expression
of
NFATc1-c4
in
the
dorsal
root
ganglia
(
DRG
)
and
spinal
cords
and
their
role
in
the
development
of
neuropathic
pain
.

The
mRNA
of
NFATc1-c4
was
detected
in
the
rat
DRG
and
dorsal
spinal
cord
.

Nerve
injury
transiently
elevated
NFATc1-c3
mRNA
levels
and
persistently
increased
NFATc4
and
C-C
chemokine
receptor
type
2
(
CCR2
)
mRNA
levels
in
the
DRG
.

However
,
NFATc1-c4
mRNA
levels
in
the
spinal
cord
were
not
altered
significantly
by
nerve
injury
.

Nerve
injury
also
significantly
increased
the
protein
level
of
dephosphorylated
NFATc4
in
the
DRG
.

Intrathecal
injection
of
the
specific
NFATc
inhibitor
11R-VIVIT
or
the
calcineurin
inhibitor
FK-506
(
tacrolimus
)
early
after
nerve
injury
significantly
attenuated
the
development
of
tactile
allodynia
.

In
addition
,
treatment
with
FK-506
or
11R-VIVIT
significantly
reduced
the
mRNA
levels
of
NFATc4
and
CCR2
but
not
large-conductance
Ca
(
2
+
)
-activated
K
(
+
)
channels
,
in
the
DRG
after
nerve
injury
.

Our
findings
suggest
that
peripheral
nerve
injury
causes
a
time-dependent
change
in
NFATc1-c4
expression
in
the
DRG
.

Calcineurin-NFATc-mediated
expression
of
pronociceptive
cytokines
contributes
to
the
transition
from
acute
to
chronic
pain
after
nerve
injury
.
The
phosphodiesterase
inhibitor
pentoxifylline
(
PTX
)
exerts
multiple
beneficial
immunomodulatory
effects
in
states
of
hyperinflammation
.

However
,
the
exact
mechanism
of
action
still
remains
elusive
,
and
the
clinical
effects
of
PTX
cannot
be
reliably
predicted
.

In
immune
cells
,
the
G
protein-coupled
adenosine
A2A
receptor
(
A2AR
)
exerts
strong
anti-inflammatory
effects
.

As
PTX
amplifies
signaling
pathways
downstream
of
Gs
protein-coupled
receptors
,
the
A2AR-signaling
pathway
might
be
involved
in
the
mediation
of
immune-suppressive
effects
of
PTX
.

Here
,
we
investigated
this
assumption
in
LPS-stimulated

In
stimulated
PMN
leukocytes
,
PTX
treatment
led
to
a
4
.
5-fold
decrease
of
the
50%
inhibitory
concentrations
of
adenosine
on
the
H2O2
production;

,
for
adenosine
plus
PTX
(
in
clinically
relevant
concentrations
)
,
an
overadditive
increase
of
inhibitory
effects
from
less
than
20%
(
estimated
for
each
)
to
56%
(
+
/
-5%
)
was
found
.

In
T
cells
,
adenosine
plus
PTX
revealed
similar
synergistic
inhibitory
effects
on
proinflammatory
cytokine
production
.

Inhibition
of
interferon
gamma
and
TNF-alpha
production
increased
from
7%
(
+
/
-1%
)
and
31%
(
+
/
-6%
)
(
PTX
alone
)
to
49%
(
+
/
-2%
)
and
69%
(
+
/
-6%
)
,
respectively
.

In
T
cells
and
PMN
leukocytes
,
mRNA
transcription
of
the
A2AR
was
significantly
increased
upon
stimulation
,
which
was
not
influenced
by
PTX
.

In
human
PMN
leukocytes
and
T
cells
,
clinically
relevant
anti-inflammatory
effects
of
PTX
can
be
achieved
only
in
the
presence
of
sufficient
adenosine
concentrations
.

Sufficient
adenosine
levels
might
be
a
prerequisite
for
the
accessibility
of
sepsis
patients
to
treatment
with
PTX

Kisspeptin
is
a
54-amino
acid
peptide
which
is
encoded
by
the
KiSS-1
gene
and
activates
the
G
protein-coupled
receptor
GPR54
.

Evidence
suggests
that
this
system
is
a
key
regulator
of
mammalian
and
human
reproduction
.

Animal
studies
have
shown
that
GPR54-deficient
mice
have
abnormal
sexual
development
.

Central
and
peripheral
administration
of
kisspeptin
stimulates
the
hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal
(
HPG
)
axis
whilst
pre-administration
of
a
gonadotrophin
releasing
hormone
(
GnRH
)
antagonist
abolishes
this
effect
.

In
humans
,
inactivating
GPR54
mutations
cause
normosmic
hypogonadotrophic
hypogonadism
whilst
activation
of
GPR54
signalling
is
associated
with
premature
puberty
.

In
healthy
human
volunteers
,
the
acute
intravenous
administration
of
kisspeptin
potently
increases
plasma
luteinising
hormone
(
LH
)
levels
and
significantly
increases
plasma
follicle
stimulating
hormone
(
FSH
)
and
testosterone
without
side
effects
in
both
males
and
in
females
particularly
in
the
preovulatatory
phase
of
the
menstrual
cycle
.

In
infertility
due
to
hypothalamic
amenorrhoea
acute
administration
of
kisspeptin
results
in
stimulation
of
reproductive
hormones
.

The
kisspeptin
/
GPR54
system
therefore
appears
to
play
an
important
role
in
the
regulation
of
reproduction
in
humans
.

Hence
kisspeptin
has
potential
as
a
novel
tool
for
the
manipulation
of
the
HPG
axis
and
treatment
of
infertility
in
humans
.

This
review
discusses
the
evidence
highlighting
kisspeptin's
key
role
in
human
reproduction
.
Missense
mutations
in
the
proteolipid
protein
1
(
PLP1
)
gene
cause
a
wide
spectrum
of
hypomyelinating
disorders
,
from
mild
spastic
paraplegia
type
2
to
severe
Pelizaeus-Merzbacher
disease
(
PMD
)
.

Mutant
PLP1
accumulates
in
the
endoplasmic
reticulum
(
ER
)
and
induces
ER
stress
.

However
,
the
link
between
the
clinical
severity
of
PMD
and
the
cellular
response
induced
by
mutant
PLP1
remains
largely
unknown
.

Accumulation
of
misfolded
proteins
in
the
ER
generally
leads
to
up-regulation
of
ER
chaperones
to
alleviate
ER
stress
.

Here
,
we
found
that
expression
of
the
PLP1-A243V
mutant
,
which
causes
severe
disease
,
depletes
some
ER
chaperones
with
a
KDEL
(
Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu
)
motif
,
in
HeLa
cells
,
MO3
.
13
oligodendrocytic
cells
,
and
primary
oligodendrocytes
.

The
same
PLP1
mutant
also
induces
fragmentation
of
the
Golgi
apparatus
(
GA
)
.

These
organelle
changes
are
less
prominent
in
cells
with
milder
disease-associated
PLP1
mutants
.

Similar
changes
are
also
observed
in
cells
expressing
another
disease-causing
gene
that
triggers
ER
stress
,
as
well
as
in
cells
treated
with
brefeldin
A
,
which
induces
ER
stress
and
GA
fragmentation
by
inhibiting
GA
to
ER
trafficking
.

We
also
found
that
mutant
PLP1
disturbs
localization
of
the
KDEL
receptor
,
which
transports
the
chaperones
with
the
KDEL
motif
from
the
GA
to
the
ER
.

These
data
show
that
PLP1
mutants
inhibit
GA
to
ER
trafficking
,
which
reduces
the
supply
of
ER
chaperones
and
induces
GA
fragmentation
.

We
propose
that
depletion
of
ER
chaperones
and
GA
fragmentation
induced
by
mutant
misfolded
proteins
contribute
to
the
pathogenesis
of
inherited
ER
stress-related
diseases
and
affect
the
disease
severity
.
Enzyme-based
grapefruit
juice
(
GFJ
)
-drug
interactions
are
mainly
due
to
mechanism-based
irreversible
inhibition
of
metabolizing
enzyme
CYP3A4
by
GFJ
components
,
but
the
transporter
organic
anion
transporting
polypeptide
(
OATP
)
2B1
is
also
a
putative
site
of
interaction
between
drugs
and
fruit
juices
(
FJ
)
in
the
absorption
process
.

Here
we
aimed
to
investigate
the
effect
of
preincubation
with
FJ
on
OATP2B1-mediated
transport
of
drugs
in
vitro
.

When
OATP2B1-expressing
Xenopus
oocytes
were
preincubated
with
GFJ
,
orange
juice
(
OJ
)
,
or
apple
juice
(
AJ
)
,
AJ
induced
a
remarkable
decrease
in
OATP2B1-mediated
estrone-3-sulfate
uptake
in
a
concentration-dependent
manner
(
IC
(
50
)
=
1
.
5%
)
.

A
similar
but
less
potent
effect
was
observed
with
OJ
(
IC
(
50
)
=
21%
)
,
whereas
GFJ
had
no
effect
.

Similar
results
were
obtained
in
preincubation
studies
using
fexofenadine
.

Preincubation
with
OJ
and
AJ
resulted
in
time-dependent
inhibition
of
OATP2B1
.

Again
,
AJ
had
the
more
potent
effect;
its
action
lasted
for
at
least
240
minutes
,
suggesting
that
AJ
irreversibly
inhibits
OATP2B1-mediated
drug
uptake
.

Kinetic
analysis
revealed
that
coincubation
and
preincubation
with
AJ
reduced
OATP2B1-mediated
estrone-3-sulfate
uptake
via
competitive
and
noncompetitive
mechanisms
,
respectively
.

Thus
,
OATP2B1
is
functionally
impaired
through
both
competitive
and
long-lasting
inhibition
mechanisms
by
AJ
and
OJ
,
but
not
GFJ
.

Interestingly
,
although
GFJ
but
not
AJ
is
able
to
irreversibly
inhibit
CYP3A4
,
in
the
case
of
OATP2B1
,
AJ
but
not
GFJ
has
a
long-lasting
inhibitory
effect
.

Accordingly
,
complex
FJ-drug
interactions
may
occur
in
vivo
,
and
their
clinical
significance
should
be
examined
.
Screening
of
a
small
in-house
library
of
1863
compounds
identified
29
compounds
that
protected
Jurkat
cells
from
hydrogen
peroxide-induced
cytotoxicity
.

From
the
cytoprotective
compounds
eleven
proved
to
possess
antioxidant
activity
(
ABTS
radical
scavenger
effect
)
and
two
were
found
to
inhibit
poly
(
ADP-ribosyl
)
ation
(
PARylation
)
,
a
cytotoxic
pathway
operating
in
severely
injured
cells
.

Four
cytoprotective
dibenzoylmethane
(
DBM
)
derivatives
were
investigated
in
more
detail
as
they
did
not
scavenge
hydrogen
peroxide
nor
did
they
inhibit
PARylation
.

These
compounds
protected
cells
from
necrotic
cell
death
while
caspase
activation
,
a
parameter
of
apoptotic
cell
death
was
not
affected
.

Hydrogen
peroxide
activated
extracellular

kinase
(
ERK1
/
2
)
and
p38
MAP
kinases
but
not
c-Jun
N-terminal
kinase
(
JNK
)
.

The
cytoprotective
DBMs
suppressed
the
activation
of
Erk1
/
2
but
not
that
of
p38
.

Cytoprotection
was
confirmed
in
another
cell
type
(
A549
lung
epithelial
cells
)
,
indicating
that
the
cytoprotective
effect
is
not
cell
type
specific
.

In
conclusion
we
identified
DBM
analogs
as
a
novel
class
of
cytoprotective
compounds
inhibiting
ERK1
/
2
kinase
and
protecting
from
necrotic
cell
death
by
a
mechanism
independent
of

Tumor
necrosis
factor-related
apoptosis-inducing
ligand
(
TRAIL
)
is
one
of
the
most
promising
candidates
for
new
cancer
therapeutics
.

However
,
resistance
to
TRAIL
in
some
cancers
remains
a
current
problem
in
recent
.

The
protein-folding
compartment
of
the
endoplasmic
reticulum
(
ER
)
is
particularly
sensitive
to
disturbances
,
which
,
if
severe
,
may
trigger
apoptosis
.

Therefore
,
we
examined
whether
verrucarin
A
(
VA
)
sensitize
TRAIL-induced
apoptosis
in
cancer
cells
by
induction
of
ER
stress
.

We
first
found
that
VA
induces
a
major
molecule
of
ER
stress
,
CCAAT
/
enhancer
binding
protein
homologous
protein
(
CHOP
)
-dependent
DR5
induction
and
subsequently
increases
TRAIL-induced
cleavage
of
caspases
and
PARP
in
TRAIL-resistant
Hep3B
cells
.

Importantly
,
the
transient
knockdown
using
siRNA
for
CHOP
abrogated
VA-induced
DR5
expression
and
attenuated
TRAIL-induced
apoptosis
.

Treatment
with
VA
also
increased
the
levels
of
phosphorylation
of
eukaryotic
translation
initiation
factor-2α
(
eIF2α
)
,
which
is
a
common
cellular
response
of
ER
stress
.

Furthermore
,
salubrinal
,
a
specific
eIF2α
phosphorylation-inducing
agent
,
increased
CHOP
and
DR5
expression
in
the
presence
of
VA
.

In
contrast
,
transfection
of
mutant-eIF2α
significantly
reversed
VA-induced
apoptosis
with
downregulation
of
CHOP-dependent
DR5
expression
.

Therefore
,
VA-induced
eIF2α
phosphorylation
seemed
to
be
important
for
CHOP
and
DR5
upregulation
and
TRAIL-induced
apoptosis
.

In
addition
,
generation
of
reactive
oxygen
species
(
ROS
)
is
an
effector
molecular
in
sensitization
of
VA-induced
ER
stress
.

We
concluded
that
VA
triggers
TRAIL-induced
apoptosis
by
eIF2α
/
CHOP-dependent
DR5
induction
via
ROS
generation
.

In
this
paper
,
the
interactions
between
opiates

were

.

CD1
mice
were
used

(

,
and
1

route
.

Using
the
hot-plate
test
,
it
was
observed
that
the
two
doses
of
tripelennamine
and
the
higher
doses
of
chlorpheniramine
and
cimetidine
had
antinociceptive
activity
.

This
increase
on
analgesia
was
also
observed
after
chronic
treatment
with
all
H1-antihistaminics
(
10
mg
/
kg
,
3
times
daily
for
4
days
)
.

When
antihistaminics
were
administered
with
morphine
,
it
was
observed
that
only
ranitidine
(
10
mg
/
kg
)
blocked
opiate
analgesia
.

On
the
other
hand
,
previous
administration
of
the
opiate
antagonist
naloxone
(
1
mg
/
kg
)
blocked
the
antinociceptive
action
of
tripelennamine
and
chlorpheniramine
(
10
mg
/
kg
)
in
control
mice
.

In
morphine-dependent
mice
(

c

implantation
of
a
75-mg
morphine
pellet
)
,
a
single
injection
of
diphenhydramine
or
ranitidine
blocked
the
analgesic
action
of
morphine
.

Chronic
administration
of
all
antihistaminics
did
not
modify
morphine
analgesia
.

These
data
are
discussed
in
relation
to
the
possible
binding
to
the
opioid
receptors
by
antihistaminics
and
their
facility
in
crossing

Gamma-hydroxybutyrate
(

its
precursors
1
,
4-butanediol
(
1
,
4-BD
)
and
gamma-butyrolactone
(
GBL
)
are
known
drugs
of
abuse
.

The
ability
of
acute
and
chronic
administration
of
equimolar
doses
of
GHB
(
200mg
/
kg
)
,
1
,
4-BD
(
174mg
/

)
and
GBL
(
166mg

)
to
produce
catalepsy
in
male
Swiss
Webster
mice
was
examined
.

GHB
,
1
,
4-BD
,
GBL
produced
catalepsy
when
injected
acutely
.

Drug
treatment
was
then
continued
for
14days
.

Tolerance
development
was
determined
on
days
6
,
14
,
and
challenged
with
a
higher
dose
on
day
15
in
those
chronically
pretreated
mice
,
and
compared
with
naïve
mice
.

Chronic
GHB
produced
tolerance
to
catalepsy
,
as
evidenced
from
area
under
the
curve
(
AUC
)
of
catalepsy
versus
time
(
min-sec
)
on
days
6
(
678±254
)
,
14
(
272±247
)
,
which
were
less
than
those
on
day
1
(
1923±269
)
.

However
,
less
tolerance
was
seen
from
GBL
or
1
,
4-BD
,
as
AUCs
on
days
6
and
14
were
not
significantly
lower
than
that
of
day
1
.

In
conclusion
,
although
equimolar
doses
were
used
,
expecting
similar
levels
of
GHB
in
the
body
,
1
,
4-BD
and
GBL
shared
only
some
of
the
in
vivo
effects
of
GHB
.

The
rate
of
metabolic
conversion
of
1
,
4-BD
and
GBL
into
GHB
might
be
responsible
for
the
differences
in
the
tolerance
development
to
these
drugs
.
RATIONALE
:
Patients
with
major
depression
show
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
(
HPA
)
axis
hyperactivity
,
but
the
mechanisms
underlying
this
abnormality
are
still
unclear
.

OBJECTIVES
:
We
have
compared
two
synthetic
glucorticoids
,
dexamethasone
and
prednisolone
,
in
their
ability
to
suppress
the
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
(
HPA
)
axis
in
depressed
patients
.

Dexamethasone
probes
glucocorticoid
receptor
(
GR
)
function
,
while
prednisolone
probes
both
GR
and
mineralocorticoid
receptor
(
MR
)
function
.

MATERIALS
AND
METHODS
:
We
used
a
single-blind
,
repeated-measure
design
.

We
administered
placebo
,
prednisolone
(
5
mg
)
or
dexamethasone
(
0
.
5
mg
)
,
at
22
:
00
,
to
18
severe
,
treatment-resistant
depressed
inpatients
(
15
of
them
with
a
history
of
childhood
trauma
)
and
14
healthy
volunteers
.

On
the
following
days
,
we
collected
salivary
cortisol
from
9
:
00
to
22
:
00
.

RESULTS
:
Depressed
patients
had
higher
salivary
cortisol
levels
compared
with
controls
,
at
baseline
and
after
both
prednisolone
and
dexamethasone
(
p<0
.
001
)
.

Consistent
with
previous
studies
,
depressed
inpatients
showed
impaired
suppression
by
dexamethasone
:
based
on
the
analysis
of
the
areas
under
the
curve
(
AUCs
)
,
suppression
by
dexamethasone
(
0
.
5
mg
)
was
-85%
in
controls
vs
-46%
in
depressed
patients
(
p
=
0
.
018
)
.

However
,
the
same
depressed
patients
showed
normal
suppression
by
prednisolone
(
5
mg
)
:
suppression
was
-41%
in
controls
and
-36%
in
depressed
patients
(
p
=
0
.
6
)
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
We
suggest
that
the
additional
effects
of
prednisolone
on
the
MR
explain
the
different
responses
to
these
glucocorticoids
in
the
same
depressed
patients
.
Olmesartan
medoxomil
is
a
new
non-peptide
angiotensin
(
A
)
II
antagonist
under
development
for
treating
hypertension
.

It
is
a
pro-drug
containing
an
ester
moiety
that
,
after
oral
administration
,
is
rapidly
cleaved
to
release
the
active
form
olmesartan
(
RNH-6270
)
.

In
vitro
,
olmesartan
is
a
highly
potent
,
competitive
and
selective
All
AT1
receptor
antagonist
with
almost
no
antagonistic
activity
on
AT2
and
AT4
receptors
.

Olmesartan
produces
selective
insurmountable
inhibition
of
All-induced
contractions
of
the
guinea-pig
aorta
and
is
much
more
potent
than
losartan
in
reducing
maximal
responses
.

In
vivo
,
intravenous
olmesartan
produces
a
rapid
and
long-lasting
inhibition
of
All-induced
pressor
responses
in
conscious
rats
.

Oral
olmesartan
medoxomil
also
inhibits
All-pressor
response
but
onset
of
the
action
is
slower
compared
with
intravenous
administration
.

Following
oral
administration
,
olmesartan
has
a
faster
onset
but
similar
potency
when
compared
with
candesartan
cilexetil
,
and
clearly
exceeds
losartan
in
both
respects
.

Oral
olmesartan
medoxomil
exhibits
dose-dependent
antihypertensive
effects
in
several
rat
and
dog
models
,
with
the
most
marked
effects
seen
in
high
plasma
renin
models
,
when
compared
with
normal
or
low
renin
types
.

Haemodynamic
studies
in
spontaneously
hypertensive
rats
and
normotensive
dogs
showed
intravenous
olmesartan
selectively
reduces
renal
vascular
resistance
,
which
suggests
that
vasodilatation
in
the
renal
vascular
bed
contributes
most
to
the
antihypertensive
action
of
the
drug
.

Long-term
treatment
with
olmesartan
medoxomil
exhibits
,
beside
antihypertensive
effects
,
beneficial
effects
in
animal
models
of
various
types
of
nephrosis
and
heart
failure
,
and
anti-atherogenic
effects
in
hyperlipidaemic
animals
.

Olmesartan
medoxomil
is
worthy
of
clinical
development
in
essential
and
renal
hypertension
,
particularly
where
renal
function
is
threatened
by
underlying
diabetic
disease
.
AIM
:
To
compare
candesartan
cilexetil
and
lisinopril
in
fixed
combination
with
hydrochlorothiazide
with
respect
to
antihypertensive
efficacy
and
tolerability
.

METHODS
:
This
was
a
double-blind
(
double-dummy
)
,
randomised
,
parallel
group
comparison
in
patients
with
a
mean
sitting
diastolic
blood
pressure
95-115
mm
Hg
on
prior
antihypertensive
monotherapy
.

Treatments
were
candesartan
cilexetil
/
hydrochlorothiazide
8
/
12
.
5
mg
once
daily
(
n
=
237
)
and
lisinopril
/
hydrochlorothiazide
10
/
12
.
5
mg
once
daily
(
n
=
116
)
for
26
weeks
.

The
primary
efficacy
variable
was
change
in
trough
sitting
diastolic
blood
pressure
.

RESULTS
:
Changes
in
mean
sitting
diastolic
blood
pressure
did
not
differ
significantly
between
the
groups
(
mean
difference
0

)
.

No
significant
differences
between
the
groups
was
found
for
other
haemodynamic
variables
(
sitting
systolic
blood
pressure
,
standing
blood
pressure
,
sitting
/
erect
heart
rate
,
and
proportion
of
responders
and
controlled
patients
)
.

Both
drugs
were
well
tolerated
but
the
proportion
of
patients
with
at
least
one
adverse
event
was
significantly
greater
in
the
lisinopril
group
(
80%
vs
69%
,
P
=
0
.
020
)
.

The
proportion
of
patients
spontaneously
reporting
cough
(
23

6%
)
and
discontinuing
therapy
due
to
adverse
events
(
12
.
0%
vs
5
.
9%
)
was
also
higher
in
the
lisinopril
group
compared
with
the
candesartan
cilexetil
group
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
The
fixed
combinations
of
candesartan
cilexetil
and
hydrochlorothiazide
8
/
12
.
5
mg
and
lisinopril
and
hydrochlorothiazide
10
/
12
.
5
mg
once
daily
are
equally
effective
as
antihypertensive
agents
.

The
fixed
combination
containing
candesartan
cilexetil
is
better
tolerated
than
that
containing
lisinopril
.
The
population
pharmacokinetics
(

)
of
atorvastatin
and
its
principal
active
metabolite
,
o-hydroxyatorvastatin
,
were
described
in
6-17
years
old
pediatric
hypercholesterolemia
patients
with
a
2-compartment
model
for
both
parent
and
metabolite
.

Informative
prior
distributions
on
selected
parameters
,
based
on
adult
data
,
were
required
to
stabilize
the
model
and
were
implemented
using
a
Bayesian
penalty
term
on
the
likelihood
function
in
the
nonlinear
mixed
effects
model
(
NONMEM
VI
with
PRIOR
)
.

Concentrations
below
the
limit
of
quantitation
were
treated
as
censored
data
using
a
conditional
likelihood
function
.

Atorvastatin
apparent
oral
clearance
(
CL
/
F
)
was
described
as
a
function
of
body
weight
using
an
allometric
equation
.

Based
on
the
final
model
,
the
typical
CL
/
F
estimates
for
a
Tanner
Stage
1
patient
(
35
kg
weight
)
and
Tanner
Stage
≥2
(
50
kg
weight
)
,
would
be
553
and
543
L
/
hour
,
respectively
.

When
scaled
allometrically
,
CL
/
F
was
similar
to
values
reported
for
adults
.

Variability
in
atorvastatin
PK
was
primarily
affected
by
weight
.
Global
gene
deletion
studies
in
mice
and
humans
have
established
the
pivotal
role
of
runt
related
transcription
factor-2
(
Runx2
)
in
both
intramembranous
and
endochondral
ossification
processes
during
skeletogenesis
.

In
this
study
,
we
for
the
first
time
generated
mice
carrying
a
conditional
Runx2
allele
with
exon
4
,
which
encodes
the
Runt
domain
,
flanked
by
loxP
sites
.

These
mice
were
crossed
with
α1
(
I
)
-collagen-Cre
or
α1
(
II
)
-collagen-Cre
transgenic
mice
to
obtain
osteoblast-
or
chondrocyte-specific
Runx2
deficient
mice
,
respectively
.

As
seen
in
Runx2
(
-
/
-
)
mice
,
perinatal
lethality
was
observed
in
α1
(
II
)
-Cre;Runx2
(
flox
/
flox
)
mice
,
but
this
was
not
the
case
in
animals
in
which
α1
(
I
)
-collagen-Cre
was
used
to
delete
Runx2
.

When
using
double
staining
with
Alizarin
red
for
mineralized
matrix
and
Alcian
blue
for
cartilaginous
matrix
,
we
observed
previously
that
mineralization
was
totally
absent
at
embryonic
day
15
.
5
throughout
the
body
in
Runx2
(
-
/
-
)
mice
,
but
was
found
in
areas
undergoing
intramembranous
ossification
such
as
skull
and
clavicles
in
α1
(
II
)
-Cre;Runx2
(
flox
/
flox
)
mice
.

In
newborn
α1
(
II
)
-Cre;Runx2
(
flox
/
flox
)
mice
,
mineralization
impairment
was
restricted
to
skeletal
areas
undergoing
endochondral
ossification
including
long
bones
and
vertebrae
.

In
contrast
,
no
apparent
skeletal
abnormalities
were
seen
in
mutant
embryo
,
newborn
,
and
3-
to
6-week
old-mice
in
which
Runx2
had
been
deleted
with
the
α1
(
I
)
-collagen-Cre
driver
.

These
results
suggest
that
Runx2
is
absolutely
required
for
endochondral
ossification
during
embryonic
and
postnatal
skeletogenesis
,
but
that
disrupting
its
expression
in
already
committed
osteoblasts
as
achieved
here
with
the
α1
(
I
)
-collagen-Cre
driver
does
not
affect
overtly
intramembranous
and
endochondral
ossification
.

The
Runx2
floxed
allele
established
here
is
undoubtedly
useful
for
investigating
the
role
of
Runx2
in
particular
cells
.

The

supports
the
existence
of
interdependence
between

.

Antisecretory

Studies

.

Conversion
of
the

Active

have
been
solubilized
from
bovine
striatal
synaptosomal
membranes
and
purified
approximately
4000-fold
using
a
combination
of
affinity
and
hydroxyapatite
chromatography
.

The
affinity
column
was
constructed
by
attaching
hybromet
,
a
newly
synthesized
opioid
ligand
with
high
affinity
for
the
mu
receptor
,
to
a
solid
support
matrix
.

A
polyclonal
antibody
was
generated
to
opioid
receptors
by
injection
of
the
purified
receptor
preparation
into
female
New
Zealand
rabbits
.

The
specificity
of
the
antiserum
was
demonstrated
by
receptor
competition
and
immunoprecipitation
studies
.

Immunological
titration
of
opioid
binding
activity
from
rat
brain
showed
that
the
antibody
was
able
to
displace
specific
binding
of
[
3H
]
etorphine
(
universal
opioid
)
and
[
3H
]
dihydromorphine
(
mu
opioid
)
from
rat
membranes
,
but
was
ineffective
against
the
binding
of

ethylketocyclazocine

)
or

The
antibody
was
able
to
precipitate
the

component
of
the
125I-labeled
affinity-purified

,
a
finding
which
suggests
that
this
subunit
may
be
an
opioid

component
.

By
indirect
immunofluorescence
,
the
antibody
was
shown
to
bind
specifically
to
the
plasma
membranes
of
the
neurotumor
cell
line
NCB-20
(
neuroblastoma
X

)
,
which
has

The
observed
fluorescence
in
the
neuroblastoma
cells
was
prevented
by
pre-adsorption
of
the
antibody
with
purified

from
rat
brain

These
results
indicate
that
the
antibody
is
specific
for

The
CXC

plays
a
major
role
in
the
activation
and
recruitment
of
polymorphonuclear

)
cells
at

activates
PMNs
by

(

The

appear
to
account
for
their
therapeutic
effects
in

,
precancerous
lesions
and
established
cancers
.

Although
RA
has
shown
considerable
promise
in
dermatologic
indications
,
certain
side
effects
have
restricted
its
use
as
a
choice
of
agent
for
chronic

.

Systematic

of
receptor-selective

has
resulted
in
two
topical
drugs
,
Tazorac

Zorac
(

)
and
Differin
(
adapalene
)
.

Tazorac
is
indicated
for
psoriasis
and
acne
and
Differin
gel
for
the
treatment
of
acne
.

These
drugs
bind
to
the
retinoic
acid
receptor
(
RAR
)
family
members
.

Various
RAR
subtype-specific
and
function-selective
retinoids
have
been
synthesized
.

These
retinoids
,
which
are
in
various
stages
of
pre-clinical
development
for
the
treatment
of
cancers
,
psoriasis
and
as
an
antidote
to
Accutane-mediated
mucocutaneous
toxicity
,
will
also
be
discussed
in
this
review
.

Discovery
of
another
retinoid
receptor
,
retinoid
X
receptor
(
RXR
)
,
revealed
that
RXR-specific
retinoids
already
existed
in
retinoid
chemical
libraries
.

Structure

studies
based
upon
binding
and
transactivation
assays
led
to
the
synthesis
of
RXR-specific
ligands
with
high

RXR
subtypes
.

These
compounds
were
found
to
be
effective
in
the
treatment
of
hyperglycemia
in
animal
models
of

II
diabetes
.

The
discovery
of
novel
retinoids
along
with
an
increased
understanding
of
the
biological
functions

mechanisms
of
action
of
retinoid

are
likely
to
result
in
improved

,
we
mapped
the

located
the

on

.

Both
genes
are
near
centromere
,
with
no

These
data
indicate
that
the
two
opioid
receptors
are
different
gene
products

ruling
out
the
possibility
that
they
may
be
differential

The
corresponding

showed
potent

.

The

Focused

simulations
enabled
the
identification
of
key
molecular

In

attention
was
paid
to
the

These
were
the

Linear

of

the

justified
in

Based
upon

,
AziPm
stabilized
the
Torpedo

stabilized

Synthetic
local
anesthetics
(
LAs
)
have
been
found
to
have
cocaine-like
characteristics
with
some
psychotomimetic
action
,
possibly
through
monoaminergic
neurotransmission
.

To
gain
insight
into
the
relation
between
LA
action
and
monoamine
transporters
,
we
investigated
the
effect
of
synthetic
LAs
on
neurotransmitter
transporters
,
including
monoamine
transporters
.

We
used
cloned
transporter
cDNAs
and
examined
transient
functional
expression
in
COS
cells
and
stable
expression
in
HeLa
cells
.

Among
the
LAs
tested
,
procaine
and
other
ester-type
LAs
inhibited
[
3H
]
DA
uptake
and
binding
of
[
3H
]
2-beta-carbomethoxy-3-beta-
(
4-fluorophenyl
)
tropane
(
CFT
)
,
a
cocaine
analogue
,
in
COS
cells
expressing
rat
dopamine
transporter
(
DAT
)
.

The
inhibition
was
concentration-dependent
.

The
inhibitory
effect
on
[
3H
]
DA
uptake
was
reversible
and
not
dependent
on
pH
,
as
observed
in
HeLa
cells
stably
expressing
DAT
.

Procaine
also
inhibited
uptake
of
norepinephrine
(
NE
)
and
serotonin
(
5-HT
)
by
the
norepinephrine
transporter
(
NET
)
or
serotonin
transporter
(
SERT
)
expressed
in
COS
cells
.

On
the
other
hand
,
procaine
and
other
LAs
had
little
or
no
effect
on
[
3H
]
GABA
and
[
3H
]
glutamate
uptake
in
COS
cells
expressing
mouse
GABA
or
rat
glutamate
/
aspartate
transporter
.

IC50
values
for
[
3H
]
DA
uptake
inhibition
correlated
well
with
those
for
[
3H
]
CFT
binding
inhibition
,
but
not
with
intrinsic
anesthetic
potency
.

Kinetic
analysis
of
monoamine
uptake
inhibition
by
procaine
in
COS
cells
expressing
rat
DAT
,
NET
or
SERT
revealed
a
competitive
action
similar
to
that
of
cocaine
.

These
results
demonstrate
that
certain
LAs
selectively
inhibit
monoamine
transporters
.

This
might
contribute
to
the
cocaine-like
psychotomimetic
action
of
certain
LAs

Insulin
resistance
is
a
very
common
associate
of
polycystic
ovary
syndrome
(
PCOS
)
.

Pathophysiology
in
relation
with
the
essential
elements
including
copper
,
magnesium
,
zinc
,
manganese
,
chromium
,
and
calcium
has
been
reported
in
women
with
insulin
resistance
.

This
prospective
study
was
designed
to
explore
whether
the
women
with
PCOS
do
exhibit
altered
serum
element
levels
in
association
with
/
without
insulin
resistance
.

One
hundred
and
thirty-two
women
with
PCOS
and
forty-six
control
women
were
studied
.

Women
with
PCOS
were
further
divided
based
on
the
presence
of
insulin
resistance
(
insulin
resistant
:
n
=
50;
non-insulin
resistant
:
n
=

)
.

In
all
women
,
basal
levels
of
gonadotropins
,
prolactin
,
testosterone
,
insulin
,
glucose
,
and
the
six
different
elements
were
measured
.

Serum
levels
of
testosterone
(
p
<
0
.
001
)
,
luteinizing
hormone
(
p
<
0
.
05
)
,
and
fasting
insulin
(
p
<
0
.
004
)
were
significantly
higher
in
the
PCOS
population
compared
to
controls
as
well
as
PCOS
women
without
insulin
resistance
.

Women
with
PCOS
exhibited
a
significantly
high
calcium
(
p
<
0
.
04
)
and
lower
manganese
levels
(
p
<
0
.
002
)
when
compared
to
controls
.

However
,
the
PCOS
women
with
insulin
resistance
exhibited
significantly
lower
serum
levels
of
magnesium
and
chromium
(
p
<
0
.
04
)
,
in
addition
to
higher
levels
of
zinc
and
copper
(
p
<
0
.
04
)
.

The
differences
in
calcium
(
p
<
0
.
03
)
and
manganese
levels
(
p
<
0
.
0001
)
became
aggravated
with
the
presence
of
insulin
resistance
when
compared
to
control
as
well
as
PCOS
women
without
insulin
resistance
.

In
PCOS-associated
insulin
resistance
,
circulating
serum
magnesium
(
r
=
-0
.
31;
p
<
0
.
03
)
and
chromium
(
r
=
-0
.
38;
p
<
0
.
006
)
status
significantly
correlated
with
fasting
insulin
levels
.

We
conclude
that
imbalanced
element
status
may
be
a
key
foundation
for
insulin
resistance
in
PCOS
.

The
findings
in
this
study
should
be
investigated
with
further
trials
in
order
to
obtain
new
insights
into
PCOS
.

Photoinitiators

such
as
2-isopropylthioxanthone
(
2-ITX
)
,
have
been
shown
to
migrate
into
food

.

Recently
,
several
studies
indicated
that

might
be
an

chemical
.

In

on

receptor-mediated
transcription
activation
have
been
studied
using
human
H295R
adrenocarcinoma
cells
and
yeast
hormone
bioassays
,
respectively
.

None
of
the
compounds
showed
androgenic
or
estrogenic
activities
,
but
clear
antiandrogenic
and
antiestrogenic
activities
were
observed
for
2-ITX
,
4-ITX
,
and
2
,
4-diethyl-TX
,
whereas
2-chloro-TX
showed
only
antiandrogenic
activity
.

In

version
of
the
H295R
steroidogenesis
assay
,
using
gas

mass
spectrometry
analysis
of
H295R
media
,
all
five
compounds
increased
levels
of
17ß-estradiol
and
estrone
.

H295R
cells
incubated
with
2-ITX
also
showed
significantly
reduced
androgen
and
increased
pregnenolone
and
progesterone
levels
.

Expression
of
particular
steroidogenic
genes
,
including
the
one
encoding
for
aromatase
(
CYP19A1
)
,
was
significantly
upregulated
after
incubation
of
H295R
cells
with
2-ITX
,
4-ITX
,
and
2
,
4-diethyl-TX
.

In
line
with
the
increased
CYP19A1
mRNA
expression
,
2-ITX
increased
catalytic
activity
of
aromatase
in
H295R
cells
as
measured
by
cognate

assays
.

The
results
indicate
that
thioxanthone
derivatives
can
act
as
potential
endocrine
disruptors
both
at
the
level
of
nuclear
receptor
signaling
and
steroid

they
undergo
little
apoptosis
within
the
first
24
h
after
FAS
inhibition
.

Instead
,
RKO
cells
exhibited
a
biphasic
stress
response
with
a
transient
accumulation
in
S
and
G2
at
4
and
8
h
that
corresponds
to
a
marked
reduction
in
cyclin
A-
and
B1-associated
kinase
activities
,
and
then
by
accumulation
of
p53
and
p21
proteins
at
16
and
24
h
and
growth
arrest
in
G1
and
G2
.

The
response
of
RKO
cells
to
FAS
inhibition
resembled
a
genotoxic
stress
response
,
but
DNA
damage
did
not
appear
to
be
an
important
downstream
effect
of
FAS
inhibition
,
because
none
was
detected
using
the
single
cell
gel
electrophoresis
assay
(
comet
assay
)
to
assess
DNA
damage
.

p53
function
is
probably
important
in
protecting
RKO
cells
from
FAS
inhibition
because
,
similar
to
many
other
tumor
lines
,
RKO
cells
expressing
a
dominant
negative
mutant
p53
gene
underwent
extensive
apoptosis
within
24
h
after
FAS
inhibition
.

Sensitization
of
cells
to
FAS
inhibitors
by
the
loss
of
p53
raises
the
possibility
that
these
agents
may
be
clinically
useful
against
malignancies
carrying
p53
mutations
.

Whereas
induction
of
apoptosis
appeared
related
to
accumulation
of
the
substrate
,
malonyl-CoA
,
after
FAS
inhibition
,
the
cytostatic
effects
were
independent
of
malonyl-CoA
accumulation
and
may
have
resulted
from
product
depletion
.

Cisapride
is
a
prokinetic
agent
which
has
been
associated
with
QT
prolongation
,
torsades

and
cardiac

.

The
cellular
mechanism
for
these
observations
is
high
affinity
blockade
of
IKr
(
encoded
by
HERG
)
.

In
a
chronic
transfection
model
using
CHO-K1
cells
,
cisapride
inhibited
HERG
tail
currents
after
a
step
to

mV
with
similar
potency
at
room
and

temperatures
(

.

Channel
inhibition
exhibited
time-

frequency-dependence
.

In
an
envelope
of

,
channel

increased
from

after
a
120
ms
depolarizing
step
to
50
+
/
-4%
after
a

0
s
step
.

These
findings
suggested
affinity
for
open
and
/
or
inactivated
channel
states
.

4
Inactivation
was
significantly
accelerated
by
cisapride
in
a
concentration-dependent
manner
and
there
was
a
small
(
-7
mV
)
shift
in
the
voltage
dependence
of
steady
state
inactivation
.

5
Channel
blockade
by
cisapride
was
modulated
by
[
K

o
,
with
a
26%
reduction
in
the
potency
of
channel
blockade
when
[
K
+
]
o
was
increased
from
1
to
10
mM
.

6
In
conclusion
,
HERG
channel
inhibition
by
cisapride
exhibits
features
consistent
with
open
and
inactivated
state
binding
and
is
sensitive
to
external
potassium
concentration
.

These
features
may
have
significant
clinical
implications
with
regard
to
the
mechanism
and
treatment
of
cisapride-induced
proarrhythmia
.
Sulfonylureas
are
widely
used
to
stimulate
insulin
secretion
in
type
2
diabetic
patients
because
they
close
adenosine
triphosphate-sensitive
potassium
(
K
(
ATP
)
)
channels
in
the
pancreatic
beta-cell
membrane
.

This
action
is
mediated
by
binding
of
the
drug
to
the
sulfonylurea
receptor
(
SUR1
)
subunit
of
the
channel
.

K
(
ATP
)
channels
are
also
present
in
a
range
of
extrapancreatic
tissues
,
but
many
of
these
contain
an
alternative
type
of
SUR
subunit
(
SUR2A
in
heart
and
SUR2B
in
smooth
muscle
)
.

The
sulfonylurea-sensitivity
of
K
(
ATP
)
channels
containing
the
different
types
of
SUR
is
variable
:
gliclazide
and
tolbutamide
block
the
beta
cell
,
but
not
the
cardiac
or
smooth
muscle
types
of
K
(
ATP
)
channels
with
high
affinity
.

Glibenclamide
and
glimepiride
,
on
the
other
hand
,
block
channels
containing
SUR1
and
SUR2
with
similar
affinity
.

The
reversibility
of
the
different
sulfonylureas
also
varies
.

Tolbutamide
and
gliclazide
produce
a
reversible
inhibition
of
Kir6
.
2
/
SUR1
and
Kir6
.
2
/
SUR2
channels
,
whereas
glibenclamide
has
a
reversible
effect
on
cardiac
,
but
not
beta-cell
,
K
(
ATP
)
channels
.

In
this
article
,
we
summarize
current
knowledge
of
how
sulfonylureas
act
on
K
(
ATP
)
channels
containing
the
different
types
of
sulfonylurea
receptor
,
and
discuss
the
implications
of
these
findings
for
the
use
of
sulfonylureas
in
the
treatment
of
diabetes
mellitus
.

We
measured
the
cortisol
response
to
the
5-HT
precursor
,
5-hydroxytryptophan
,
(
5-HTP
)
in
seven
patients
with
major
depression
before
and
after
8
weeks
treatment
with
the
tricyclic
antidepressant
,
clomipramine
.

The
cortisol
response
to
5-HTP
was
significantly
increased
following
clomipramine
treatment
,
suggesting
that
clomipramine
,
like
selective
serotonin
re-uptake
inhibitors
(
SSRIs
)
,
enhances
this
5-HT2
receptor
mediated
response
.

Because
other
tricyclic
antidepressants
do
not
increase
5-HTP-mediated
cortisol
release
,
it
seems
unlikely
that
enhancement
of
5-HT2
receptor
function
is
a
critical
mechanism
for
antidepressant
action
.

However
,
facilitation
of
neurotransmission
at
5-HT2
receptors
could
account
for
the
efficacy
of
clomipramine
and
SSRIs
in
the
treatment
of
obsessive
compulsive
disorder
and
also
for
their
liability
to
cause
orgasmic
dysfunction

Cofactor
and
tryptophan
accessibility
of
the
65-kDa
form
of
rat
brain
glutamate
decarboxylase
(
GAD
)
was
investigated
by
fluorescence
quenching
measurements
using
acrylamide
,
I-
,
and
Cs
+
as
the
quenchers
.

Trp
residues
were
partially
exposed
to
solvent
.

I-
was
less
able
and
Cs
+
was
more
able
to
quench
the
fluorescence
of
Trp
residues
in
the
holoenzyme
of
GAD
(
holoGAD
)
than
the
apoenzyme
(
apoGAD
)
.

The
fraction
of
exposed
Trp
residues
were
in
the
range
of
30-49%
.

In
contrast
,
pyridoxal-P
bound
to
the
active
site
of
GAD
was
exposed
to
solvent
.

I-
was
more
able
and
Cs
+
was
less
able
to
quench
the
fluorescence
of
pyridoxal-P
in
holoGAD
.

The
cofactor
was
present
in
a
positively
charged
microenvironment
,
making
it
accessible
for
interactions
with
anions
.

A
difference
in
the
exposure
of
Trp
residues
and
pyridoxal-P
to
these
charged
quenchers
suggested
that
the
exposed
Trp
residues
were
essentially
located
outside
of
the
active
site
.

Changes
in
the
accessibility
of
Trp
residues
upon
pyridoxal-P
binding
strongly
supported
a
significant
conformational
change
in
GAD
.

Fluorescence
intensity
measurements
were
also
carried
out
to
investigate
the
unfolding
of
GAD
using
guanidine
hydrochloride
(
GdnHCl
)
as
the
denaturant
.

At
0
.
8-1
.
5
M
GdnHCl
,
an
intermediate
step
was
observed
during
the
unfolding
of
GAD
from
the
native
to
the
denatured
state
,
and
was
not
found
during
the
refolding
of
GAD
from
the
denatured
to
native
state
,
indicating
that
this
intermediate
step
was
not
a
reversible
process
.

However
,
at
>1
.
5
M
GdnHCl
for
holoGAD
and
>2
.
0
M
GdnHCl
for
apoGAD
,
the
transition
leading
to
the
denatured
state
was
reversible
.

It
was
suggested
that
the
intermediate
step
involved
the
dissociation
of
native
dimer
of
GAD
into
monomers
and
the
change
in
the
secondary
structure
of
the
protein
.

Circular
dichroism
revealed
a
decrease
in
the
alpha-helix
content
of
GAD
from
36
to
28%
.

The
unfolding
pattern
suggested
that
GAD
may
consist
of
at
least
two
unfolding
domains
.

Unfolding
of
the
lower
GdnHCl-resisting
domain
occurred
at
a
similar
concentration
of
denaturant
for
apoGAD
and
holoGAD
,
while
unfolding
of
the
higher
GdnHCl-resisting
domain
occurred
at
a
higher
concentration
of
GdnHCl
for
apoGAD
than
holoGAD
.
We
aimed
at
investigating
the
effects
of
sulfite-induced

apoptosis
mediated
by
secretory
phospholipase
A2
(
sPLA2
)
on
somatosensory

in

.

Thirty
male

Wistar
rats
were
randomized
into
three
experimental
groups
as
follows;
control
(
C
)
,
sodium
metabisulfite
treated
(
S
)
,
sodium
metabisulfite
+
quinacrine
treated
(
SQ
)
.

Sodium
metabisulfite
(
100
mg
/
kg
/
day
)
was
given
by
gastric
gavage
for
5
weeks
and
10
mg
/
kg
/
day
quinacrine
was
applied
as
a
single
dose
of
intraperitoneal
injection
for
the
same
period
.

The
latencies
of
SEP
components
were
significantly
prolonged
in
the
S
group
and
returned
to
control
levels
following
quinacrine
administration
.

Plasma-S-sulfonate
level
was
increased
in
S
and
SQ
groups
.

TBARS
levels
in
the
S
group
were
significantly
higher
than
those
detected
in
controls
.

Quinacrine
significantly
decreased
brain
TBARS
levels
in
the
SQ
group
compared
with
the
S
group
.

Quinacrine
treatment
did
not
have
an
effect
on
the
increased
sPLA2
level
of
the
sulfite
administered
group
.

Immunohistochemistry
showed
that
sulfite
caused
an
increase
in
caspase-3
and
TUNEL
positive
cells
,
restored
to
control
levels
via
quinacrine
administration
.

This
study
showed
that
sPLA2
might
play
a
role
in
ingested
sulfite-induced
SEP
alterations
,
oxidative
stress
,
apoptotic
cell

To
find
out
the
reason
of
weak

property
of
dihydroetorphine
,
we
compared
the
affinities
of
dihydroetorphine
to
the
type
selective
opioid
receptor
and
inhibition
effect
on
the
adenylyl
cyclase
activity
with
those
of
etorphine
.

Dihydroetorphine
and
etorphine
have
almost
the
same
binding
affinities
to
all
types
(
mu
,
delta
,
and
kappa
)
of
opioid
receptors
and
antagonist
binding
sites
,
and
have
similar
inhibition
activities
to
forskolin
stimulated
adenylyl
cyclase
.

However
,
dihydroetorphine
showed
significantly
smaller
value
of
DTNB-index
compared
with
that
of
etorphine
.

This
differentiation
may
explain
partly
the
high
analgesic

low
dependence
properties
of
dihydroetorphine
.
The
effects
of
enprofylline
were
studied
on
A1
adenosine
receptors
of
rat
fat
cells
and
on
A2
adenosine
receptors
of
human
platelets
and
of
guinea-pig
lung
.

Enprofylline
antagonized
the
5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine
(
NECA
)
-induced
stimulation
of
platelet
adenylate
cyclase
activity
with
a
KB
of
130
microM
.

In
human
platelets
,
enprofylline
did
not
antagonize
but
potentiated
the
NECA-induced
inhibition
of
aggregation
.

This
potentiation
was
abolished
in
the
presence
of
the
phosphodiesterase
inhibitor
papaverine
.

An
adenosine
antagonistic
effect
of
enprofylline
could
not
be
evaluated
on
A2
receptors
of
guinea-pig
lung
because
the
xanthine
enhanced
basal
and
NECA-stimulated
cyclic
AMP
accumulation
.

Enprofylline
antagonized
the
N6-R-
(
-
)
-phenylisopropyladenosine
(
R-PIA
)
-induced
inhibition
of
rat
fat
cell
adenylate
cyclase
with
a
KB
of
32
microM
.

The
Ki
value
for
inhibition
of
[
3H
]
PIA
binding
to
fat
cell
membranes
was
45
microM
.

Enprofylline
inhibited
cyclic
AMP
phosphodiesterase
activity
of
human
platelets
,
guinea-pig
lung
and
rat
fat
cells
with
Ki
values
of
15
,
130
and
110
microM
,
respectively
.

The
results
show
that
enprofylline
was
nearly
equipotent
as
antagonist
at
A1
and
A2
adenosine
receptors
.

Mechanisms
other
than
adenosine
antagonism
or
phosphodiesterase
inhibition
may
be
involved
in
the
pharmacological
effects
of
enprofylline
.
Methionine
synthase
catalyzes
the
conversion
of
N5-methyltetrahydrofolate
and
homocysteine
to
tetrahydrofolate
and
methionine
.

Methylcobalamin
(
Me-Cbl
)
is
tightly
bound
to
methionine
synthase
and
is
required
for
enzymatic
activity
.

When
added
to
crude
tissue
homogenates
,
Me-Cbl
stimulates
methionine
synthase
but
similar
stimulation
is
observed
with
hydroxocobalamin
,
cyanocobalamin
(
CN-Cbl
)
,
and
adenosyl-Cbl
,
although
the
mechanisms
involved
are
unknown
.

We
prepared
human
apomethionine
synthase
and
studied
its
activation
in
the
presence
of
[
14C
]
CN-Cbl
and
[
14CH3
]
Me-Cbl
with
concentrations
of
2-mercaptoethanol
ranging
from
0
.
15
to
100
mM
.

We
observed
that
the
removal
of
the
labeled
upper
axial
ligands
from
CN-Cbl
and
Me-Cbl
both
paralleled
the
activation
of
human
apomethionine
synthase
.

Spectral
studies
employing
CN-Cbl
and
Me-Cbl
showed
that
both
forms
of
Cbl
must
be
converted
to
Cob
(
II
)
alamin
before
they
can
bind
to
human
apomethionine
synthase
and
convert
it
to
its
activated
holoenzyme
form
.

Studies
with
14
different
Cbl
analogues
with
alterations
in
various
portions
of
the
corrin
ring
and
the
nucleotide
showed
that
all
of
the
analogues
were
able
to
fully
activate
human
methionine
synthase
when
they
were
reduced
with
2-mercaptoethanol
.

Full
activation
occurred
at
lower
concentrations
of
many
of
the
Cbl
analogues
than
occurred
with
Cbl
itself
.

We
conclude
that
Me-Cbl
and
other
forms
of
Cob
(
III
)
alamin
do
not
bind
to
human
apomethionine
synthase
and
that
all
must
first
be
reduced
to
Cob
(
II
)
alamin
before
such
binding
can
occur
.

The
fact
that
human
methionine
synthase
shows
little
absolute
specificity
for
alterations
in
various
portions
of
the
Cbl
molecule
suggests
that
the
potent
inhibition
of
mammalian
methionine
synthase
activity
observed
in
vivo
with
various
Cbl
analogues
is
due
to
inhibition
of
intracellular
Cbl
transport
or
to
inhibition
of
the
enzymatic
formation
of
Cob
(
II
)
alamin
rather
than
to
direct
inhibition
of
mammalian
methionine
synthase
itself
.
Injection
of
L-p-tyrosine
(
800
mg
/
kg
,
2
h
)
increased
the
mouse
striatal
para-hydroxyphenylacetic
acid
(
p-HPAA
)
concentrations
.

A
smaller
dose
of
D
,
L-m-tyrosine
(
20
mg
/
kg
,
2
h
)
produced
a
larger
increase
in
mouse
striatal
meta-hydroxyphenylacetic
acid
(
m-HPAA
)
concentrations
.

The
administration
of
L-phenylalanine
to
mice
caused
a
slight
increase
in
the
p-HPAA
concentration
in
the
corpus
striatum
after
2
h
while
a
larger
dose
of
L-phenylalanine
(
800
mg
/
kg
)
produced
a
greater
increase
.

Eight
hours
following
L-phenylalanine
injection
,
p-HPAA
concentrations
were
still
elevated
.

With
D-phenylalanine
a
significant
increase
was
observed
at
eight
hours
after
drug
administration
.

Two
drugs
which
reduce
dopamine
synthesis
,
alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine
and
apomorphine
,
decreased
m-HPAA
striatal
concentrations
without
affecting
p-HPAA
concentrations
.

From
these
results
,
it
is
proposed
that
tyrosine
hydroxylase
activity
determines
p-HPAA
concentrations
by
regulating
p-tyrosine
availability
.

This
enzyme
may
also
synthesize
m-tyrosine
which
is
subsequently
decarboxylated
to
form
m-tyramine
and
then
oxidatively
deaminated
to
form
m-HPAA
.

At

After

regressed

For

The

Given
the
importance
of
the
finding
that
suggests
a
novel
pathway
of
regulation
of
skeletal
muscle
,
we
aim
to
examine
the
effects
of
phosphorylation
on
cross-bridge
orientation
and
rotational
motion
.

We
find
that
:
(
i
)
relaxed
cross-bridges
,
but
not
active
ones
,
are
statistically
better
ordered
in
muscle
where
the
RLC
is
dephosporylated
compared
with
phosphorylated
RLC;
(

)
relaxed
phosphorylated
and
dephosphorylated
cross-bridges
rotate
equally
slowly;
and
(
iii
)
active
phosphorylated
cross-bridges
rotate
considerably
faster
than
dephosphorylated
ones
during
isometric
contraction
but
the
duty
cycle
remained
the
same
,
suggesting
that
both
phosphorylated
and
dephosphorylated
muscles
develop
the
same
isometric
tension
at
full
Ca
(
2
+
)
saturation
.

A
simple
theory
was
developed
to
account
for
this
fact
.
In
this
study
,
we
investigated
the
alterations
of
the
redox
balance
induced
by
the
lipid
fraction
of
oxLDL
in
Caco-2
intestinal
cells
,
and
the
effects
of
tyrosol
and
protocatechuic
acid
,
two
dietary
phenolic
compounds
.

We
found
that
oxidized
lipids
extracted
from
oxLDL
(
LipE
)
induced
oxidative
stress
by
determining
,
6
h
after
treatment
,
ROS
overproduction
(
about
a
100%
and
a
43%
increase
of
O*2
and
H2O2
production
,
respectively
,
P<
.

control
)
and
,
12
h
after
treatment
,
GSH
depletion
(
about
a
26%
decrease
,
P<
.
05
:
LipE
vs
.

control
)
,
and
by
impairing
the
activities
of
superoxide
dismutase
,
catalase
and
glutathione
peroxidase
.

In
response
to
the
induced
oxidative
stress
,
we
observed
significant
overexpression
of
glutathione
peroxidase
(
6
h
after
treatment
:
P<
.
05
)
,
glutathione
reductase
and
gamma-glutamylcysteine
synthetase
(
12
h
after
treatment
:
P<
.
05
)
.

Notably
,
when
GSH
depletion
occurred
,
p66Shc
protein
expression
increased
by
about
300%
with
respect
to
control
(
P<
.
001;
LipE
vs
.

control
)
.

These
effects
were
fully
counteracted
by
dietary
phenolics
which
inhibited
ROS
overproduction
and
GSH
consumption
,
rendered
the
reactive
transcription
of
glutathione-associated
enzymes
unnecessary
and
blocked
the
intracellular
signals
leading
to
the
overexpression
and
rearrangement
of
p66Shc
signalling
molecule
.

Altogether
,
these
results
suggest
that
the
impairment
of
the
antioxidant
system
hijacks
intestinal
cells
towards
an
apoptotic-prone
phenotype
via
the
activation
of
p66Shc
molecule
.

They
also
propose
a
reappraisal
of
dietary
polyphenols
as
intestinal
protecting
agents
,
indicating
the
antiapoptotic
effect
as
a
further
mechanism
of
action
of
these
antioxidant
compounds

Envenomation
by
Australian

results
mainly
in
muscle
paralysis
largely
attributed
to
the
presence
of

α-neurotoxins

However
,
poorly

suggest
that
these

may
contain
snake
presynaptic
phospholipase
A2
neurotoxins
(
SPANs
)
that
irreversibly
inhibit

Using

the
present

isolated
the
first
multimeric
SPAN
complex
from
the
venom
of
the
Australian
common

,
Austrelaps

The
multimeric
SPAN
P-elapitoxin-As1a
(
P-EPTX-As1a
)
along
with
two
novel
monomeric
SPANs
and
a
new
postsynaptic
α-neurotoxin
were
then
pharmacologically
characterized
using
the
chick
biventer

preparation
.

All
SPANs
inhibited
nerve-evoked
twitch
contractions
at
the
neuromuscular
junction
without
inhibiting
contractile
responses
to
cholinergic
agonists
or
KCl
.

These
actions
are
consistent
with
a
prejunctional
action
to
inhibit
neurotransmitter
release
,
without
direct
myotoxicity
.

Furthermore
,
the
multimeric
P-EPTX-As1a
caused
tetanic
'fade'
in
muscle
tension
under
high
frequency
nerve
stimulation
,
and
produced
a
triphasic
alteration
to
neurotransmitter
release
.

These
actions
have
been
previously
noted
with
other
multimeric
SPAN
complexes
such
as
taipoxin
.

Moreover
,
the
neurotoxic
α-subunit
of
P-EPTX-As1a
shows
high

be
introduced

Here

we
report
that
a
single
intravenous
injection
of
Ad
containing
the
prolidase
gene
with
a
6×
histidine-tag
(
Ad-prolidase

introduced
high-levels
of
rHu
prolidase
in
the
circulation
of
mice
which
peaked
on
days

This
level
of
prolidase
is
∼120
times
greater
than
that
of

level
in

To
determine

was
exported
into

circulation
,
enzyme
activity
was
measured
in

highest
levels
of

on

by
4-8h
against
exposure
to
two

,
overexpression

protected

out
of

surviving

showed
no
symptoms

In
conclusion
,
the
results
suggest
that
gene
delivery
using
Ad
is
capable
of
introducing
persistent
and
high
levels
of
human

in

The
gene-delivered

The

Brexpiprazole
,
a
compound
sharing
structural
molecular
characteristics
with
aripiprazole
,
is
currently
under
investigation
for
the
treatment
of
schizophrenia
and
depression
.

Using
electrophysiologic
techniques
,
the
present
study
assessed
the
in
vivo
action
of
brexpiprazole
on
serotonin
(
5-HT
)
receptor
subtypes
5-HT1A
,
5-HT1B
,
and
5-HT2A;
dopamine
(
DA
)
D2
autoreceptors
,
and
alpha1-
and
alpha2-adrenergic
receptors
.

In
addition
,
the
effects
on
5-HT1A
autoreceptors
in
the
dorsal
raphe
nucleus
(
DRN
)
and
D2
autoreceptors
in
the
ventral
tegmental
area
(
VTA
)
were
compared
with
those
of
aripiprazole
,
an
agent
in
wide
clinical
use
.

In
the
DRN
,
brexpiprazole
completely
inhibited
the
firing
of
5-HT
neurons
via
5-HT1A
agonism
and
was
more
potent
than
aripiprazole
(
ED50
=
230
and
700
mug
/
kg
,
respectively
)
.

In
the
locus
coeruleus
,
brexpiprazole
reversed
the
inhibitory
effect
of
the
preferential
5-HT2A
receptor
agonist
DOI
(
2
,
5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine
)
on
norepinephrine
neuronal
firing
(
ED50
=
110
mug
/
kg
)
,
demonstrating
5-HT2A
antagonistic
action
.

Brexpiprazole
reversed
the
inhibitory
effect
of
the
DA
agonist
apomorphine
on
VTA
DA
neurons
(
ED50
=
61
mug
/
kg
)
,
whereas
it
was
ineffective
when
administered
alone
,
indicating
partial
agonistic
action
on
D2
receptors
.

Compared
with
aripiprazole
,
which
significantly
inhibited
the
firing
activity
of
VTA
DA
neurons
,
brexpiprazole
displayed
less
efficacy
at
D2
receptors
.

In
the
hippocampus
,
brexpiprazole
acted
as
a
full
agonist
at
5-HT1A
receptors
on
pyramidal
neurons
.

Furthermore
,
it
increased
5-HT
release
by
terminal
alpha2-adrenergic
heteroceptor
but
not
5-HT1B
autoreceptor
antagonism
.

In
the
lateral
geniculate
nucleus
,
brexpiprazole
displayed
alpha1B-adrenoceptor
antagonistic
action
.

Taken
together
,
these
results
provide
insight
into
the
in
vivo
action
of
brexpiprazole
on
monoamine
targets
relevant
in
the
treatment
of
depression
and
schizophrenia
.
In
the
heart
,
insulin
stimulates
a
variety
of
kinase
cascades
and
controls
glucose
utilization
.

Because
insulin
is
able
to
activate
Akt
and
inactivate
AMP-activated
protein
kinase
(
AMPK
)
in
the
heart
,
we
hypothesized
that
Akt
can
regulate
the
activity
of
AMPK
.

To
address
the
potential
existence
of
this
novel
signaling
pathway
,
we
used
a
number
of
experimental
protocols
to
activate
Akt
in
cardiac
myocytes
and
monitored
the
activation
status
of
AMPK
.

Mouse
hearts
perfused
in
the
presence
of
insulin
demonstrated
accelerated
glycolysis
and
glucose
oxidation
rates
as
compared
with
non-insulin-perfused
hearts
.

In
addition
,
insulin
caused
an
increase
in
Akt
phosphorylation
and
a
decrease
in
AMPK
phosphorylation
at
its
major
regulatory
site
(
threonine
172
of
the
alpha
catalytic
subunit
)
.

Transgenic
mice
overexpressing
a
constitutively
active
mutant
form
of
Akt1
displayed
decreased
phosphorylation
of
cardiac
alpha-AMPK
.

Isolated
neonatal
cardiac
myocytes
infected
with
an
adenovirus
expressing
constitutively
active
mutant
forms
of
either
Akt1
or
Akt2
also
suppressed
AMPK
phosphorylation
.

However
,
Akt-dependent
depression
of
alpha-AMPK
phosphorylation
could
be
overcome
in
the
presence
of
the
AMPK
activator
,
metformin
,
suggesting
that
an
override
mechanism
exists
that
can
restore
AMPK
activity
.

Taken
together
,
this
study
suggests
that
there
is
cross-talk
between
the
AMPK
and
Akt
pathways
and
that
Akt
activation
can
lead
to
decreased
AMPK
activity
.

In
addition
,
our
data
suggest
that
the
ability
of
insulin
to
inhibit
AMPK
may
be
controlled
via
an
Akt-mediated
mechanism
.
We
describe
a
genetic
AND
gate
for
cell-targeted
metabolic
labeling
and
proteomic
analysis
in
complex
cellular
systems
.

The
centerpiece
of
the
AND
gate
is
a
bisected
methionyl-tRNA
synthetase
(
MetRS
)
that
charges
the
Met
surrogate
azidonorleucine
(
Anl
)
to
tRNA
(
Met
)
.

Cellular
protein
labeling
occurs
only
upon
activation
of
two
different
promoters
that
drive
expression
of
the
N-
and
C-terminal
fragments
of
the
bisected
MetRS
.

Anl-labeled
proteins
can
be
tagged
with
fluorescent
dyes
or
affinity
reagents
via
either
copper-catalyzed
or
strain-promoted
azide-alkyne
cycloaddition
.

Protein
labeling
is
apparent
within
5
min
after
addition
of
Anl
to
bacterial
cells
in
which
the
AND
gate
has
been
activated
.

This
method
allows
spatial
and
temporal
control
of
proteomic
labeling
and
identification
of
proteins
made
in
specific
cellular
subpopulations
.

The
approach
is
demonstrated
by
selective
labeling
of
proteins
in
bacterial
cells
immobilized
in
the
center
of
a
laminar-flow
microfluidic
channel
,
where
they
are
exposed
to
overlapping
,
opposed
gradients
of
inducers
of
the
N-
and
C-terminal
MetRS
fragments
.

There
is
a
growing
appreciation
for
the
importance
of
glial
cells
to
overall
brain
function
.

For
decades
,
glial
cells
have
been
considered
relatively
passive
supporters
of
nerve
cell
function
,
providing
only
structural
and
metabolic
support
to
the
communicating
neurons
.

Now
,
rapidly
emerging
evidence
demonstrates
that
glial
cells
are
active
participants
in
the
processes
of
synaptic
patterning
and
synaptic
transmission
.

Like
their
neuronal
neighbors
residing
in
steroid
sensitive
brain
regions
,
glial
cells
demonstrate
a
responsiveness
to
gonadal
steroids
that
has
been
best
characterized
by
physical
changes
in
their
morphology
.

However
,
because
of
their
intimate
relationship
,
the
nature
of
neuronal-glial
interactions
has
been
challenging
to
study
in
vivo
and
until
recently
,
the
functional
relevance
of
steroid-induced
changes
in
glial
morphology
to
neuroendocrine
functions
could
only
be
implied
from
anatomical
and
in
vitro
studies
.

The
advent
of
microarray
technology
offers
the
potential
to
uncover
steroid
regulation
of
glial-specific
genes
that
may
play
a
role
in
hormone-dependent
neuronal-glial
interactions
.

Our
microarray
analysis
of
the
rodent
hypothalamus
has
revealed
that
estradiol
increases
the
expression
of
a
number
of
glial-specific
genes
,
including
glutamine
synthetase
,
an
enzyme
that
inactivates
glutamate
through
its
conversion
to
glutamine
.

Given
that
glutamine
is
the
predominant
precursor
for
releasable
pools
of
glutamate
,
our
observation
that
estradiol
increases
glutamine
synthetase
gene
and
protein
expression
suggests
that
hormonal
regulation
of
glutamate
neurotransmission
involves
hormonally
responsive
glia
.

Thus
,
hormonally
responsive
glia
may
play
a
pivotal
role
in
estradiol-mediated
synaptic
transmission
underlying
neuroendocrine
function
.

possess
a

distinct
of
that
of

Unlike
the
sulfonamides

which
bind

phenols
are
anchored

this

Lipids
in
the
nervous
system
are
represented
by
cholesterol
and
phospholipids
as
constituents
of
cell
membranes
and
,
in
particular
,
of
myelin
.

Therefore
,
lipids
are
finely
regulated
to
guarantee
physiological
functions
.

In
the
central
nervous
system
,
cholesterol
is
locally
synthesized
due
to
the
presence
of
the
blood
brain
barrier
.

In
the
peripheral
nervous
system
cholesterol
is
either
uptaken
by
lipoproteins
and
/
or
produced
by
de
novo
biosynthesis
.

Defects
in
lipid
homeostasis
in
these
tissues
lead
to
structural
and
functional
changes
that
often
result
in
different
pathological
conditions
depending
on
the
affected
pathways
(

cholesterol

,
cholesterol
efflux
,

etc
.

)
.

Alterations
in
cholesterol
metabolism
in
the
central
nervous
system
are
linked
to
several
disorders
such
as
Alzheimer's
disease
,
Huntington
disease
,
Parkinson
disease
,
Multiple
Sclerosis
,
Smith-Lemli-Opitz
syndrome
,
Niemann-Pick
type
C
disease
,
and
glioblastoma
.

In
the
peripheral
nervous
system
changes
in
lipid
metabolism
are
associated
with
the
development
of
peripheral
neuropathy
that
may
be
caused
by
metabolic
disorders
,
injuries
,
therapeutics
and
autoimmune
diseases
.

Transcription
factors
,
such
as
the
Liver
X
receptors
(
LXRs
)
,
regulate
both
cholesterol
and
fatty
acid
metabolism
in
several
tissues
including
the
nervous
system
.

In
the
last
few
years
several
studies
elucidated
the
biology
of
LXRs
in
nervous
system
due
to
the
availability
of
knock-out
mice
and
the
development
of
synthetic
ligands
.

Here
,
we
review
a
survey
of
the
literature
focused
on
central
and
peripheral

and
in
physiological

pathological
settings

on
the
roles
played
by
LXRs

The
polyamines
spermidine
,
spermine
,
and
their
precursor
putrescine
are
essential
for
cell
growth
and
the
regulation
of
the
cell
cycle
.

Recent
studies
suggest
that
excessive
accumulation
of
polyamines
favors
either
malignant
transformation
or
apoptosis
,
depending
on
the
cell
type
and
the
stimulus
.

This
study
examines
the
involvement
of
polyamines
in
the
induction
of
apoptosis
by
the
DNA
topoisomerase
I
inhibitor
,
camptothecin
.

In

,
camptothecin
induced

accompanied
by

specific
inhibitor
of
ornithine
decarboxylase
(
ODC
)
that
is
the
first
rate-limiting

,
decreased
the
apoptotic
index
.

Delayed
apoptosis
was
accompanied
by
a
decrease
in
caspase
3
activity
in
polyamine-depleted
cells
.

Addition
of
putrescine
restored
the
induction
of
apoptosis
as
indicated
by
an
increase
in
the
number
of
detached
cells
and
caspase

activity
.

Polyamine
depletion
did
not
change
the
level
of
caspase

protein
.

S-adenosylmethionine
decarboxylase
by

]
led
to
depletion
of
spermidine
and
spermine
with
a
significant
accumulation
of
putrescine
and
induction
of
ODC
.

The
DEGBG-treated
cells
showed
an
increase
in
apoptosis
,
suggesting
the
importance
of
putrescine
in
the
apoptotic
process
.

Addition
of
putrescine
to
DFMO-treated
cell
extracts
did
not
increase
caspase
3
activity
.

The
above
results
indicate
that
polyamine
depletion
delays
the
onset
of
apoptosis
in
IEC-6
cells
and
confers
protection
against
DNA
damaging
agents
,
suggesting
that
polyamines
might
be
involved
in
the
caspase
activating
signal
cascade
.

.

Treatment
of
tumor-induced
seizures
is
often
inadequate
with
traditional
antiepileptic
drugs
(
AED
)
due
to
a
variety
of
factors
,
including
activation
of
glutamatergic
NMDA
receptors
,
alterations
of
neuronal
input
pathways
,
and
tumor
growth
.

Levetiracetam
(
LEV
)
is
a
2nd
generation
non-enzyme
inducing
AED
with
a
novel
mechanism
of
action
,
binding
to
neuronal
synaptic
vesicle
protein
SV2A
,
that
has
been
previously
shown
to
reduce
seizure
activity
in
patients
with
primary
brain
tumors
.

Due
to
its
unique
mechanism
of
action
,
it
has
been
postulated
that
LEV
may
also
be
effective
in
controlling
seizures
from
MBT
.

A
retrospective
chart
review
was
performed
of
all
Neuro-Oncology
Center
patients
with
MBT
who
had
received
LEV
for
seizure
control
.

Thirteen
patients
were
reviewed
with
a
median
age
of
55
.
1
years
(
range
:
34-70
)
.

Six
patients
had
breast
cancer
,
five
had
lung
cancer
,
and
two
had
melanoma
.

LEV
was
used
as
an
add-on
AED
in
seven
patients
(
54%
)
and
as
monotherapy
in
six
patients
(
46%
)
,
with
a
median
dose
of
1
,
000
mg
/
day
(
range
:
500-3
,
000
)
.

The
baseline
median
seizure
frequency
was
one
ictal
event
every
other
day
.

After
the
addition
of
LEV
,
the
median
seizure
frequency
was
reduced
to
0
per
week
.

The
seizure
frequency
was
reduced
to
less
than
50%
of
the
pre-LEV
baseline
in
100%
of
patients
(
P

test
)
,
with
10
patients
(
77%;
confidence
interval

)
noting
complete

.

The
most
common
adverse
event
was
somnolence
and
headache
,
noted
in
3
of
13
patients
(
23%
)
.

LEV
was
very
effective
and
well
tolerated
in
MBT
patients
with
seizures
and
should
be
considered
for
add-on
therapy
or
as
a
substitute

monotherapy

The
role

has
been
studied
extensively;
however
,
the
role
of
the

We
used

In

we
characterized
the
effect
of

.

For
the
propeptide

BACKGROUND
:
Two
clinical
trials
have
shown
that
users
of
5α-reductase
inhibitors
finasteride
and
dutasteride
(
5-ARIs
)
have
reduced
overall
prostate
cancer
risk
,
while
the
proportion
of
high-grade
tumors
is
increased
.

We
studied
tumor
characteristics
,
risk
of
biochemical
recurrence
and
mortality
after
radical
prostatectomy
in
5-ARI
and
alpha-blocker
users
.

METHODS
:
The
study
cohort
consisted
of
1
,
315
men
who
underwent
radical
prostatectomy
at
the
Tampere
University
Hospital
during
1995-2009
.

Biochemical
relapse
was
defined
as
serum
PSA
≥
0
.
2
ng
/
ml
after
the
operation
.

Information
on
mortality
and
medication
purchases
was
obtained
from
national
registries
.

Cox
proportional
regression
was
used
to
analyze
hazard
ratios
(
HRs
)
and
95%
confidence
intervals
(
95%
CI
)
of
biochemical
relapse
and
death
.

RESULTS
:
The
proportion
of
high-grade
(
Gleason
7-10
)
tumors
was
significantly
elevated
among
men
who
had
used
5-ARIs
for
4
years
or
longer
compared
to
the
non-users
(
83
.
3%
vs
.

53
.
3%
,
respectively
)
.

Survival
curves
for
biochemical
relapse-free
survival
differed
between
long-term
and
short-term
5-ARI
users
,
but
the
hazard
ratio
remained
statistically
non-significant
.

Risk
of
biochemical
recurrence
was
elevated
among
alpha-blocker
users
(
HR
1
.
68
,
95%
CI
1
.
37-2
.
06
)
,
but
in
sensitivity
analyses
this
was
evident
only
in
men
using
alpha-blockers
after
prostatectomy
.

Mortality
was
not
associated
with
medication
usage
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
Long-term
users
of
finasteride
or
dutasteride
had
more
often
high-grade
prostate
cancer
.

Our
results
suggest
also
worse
progression-free
survival
.

The
association
between
risk
of
biochemical
recurrence
and
post-operative
alpha-blocker
usage
suggests
that
voiding
or
storage
symptoms
after
prostatectomy
may
predict
biochemical
relapse
.

The
increased
insulin
secretory
burden
placed
on
pancreatic
β-cells
during
obesity
and
insulin
resistance
can
ultimately
lead
to
β-cell
dysfunction
and
death
and
the
development
of
type
2
diabetes
.

Mitogen-inducible
gene
6
(
Mig6
)
is
a
cellular
stress-responsive
protein
that
can
negatively
regulate
the
duration
and
intensity
of
epidermal
growth
factor
receptor
signaling
and
has
been
classically
viewed
as
a
molecular
brake
for
proliferation
.

In
this
study
,
we
used
Mig6
heterozygous
knockout
mice
(
Mig6
(
+
/
-
)
)
to
study
the
role
of
Mig6
in
regulating
β-cell
proliferation
and
survival
.

Surprisingly
,
the
proliferation
rate
of
Mig6
(
+
/
-
)
pancreatic
islets
was
lower
than
wild-type
islets
despite
having
comparable
β-cell
mass
and
glucose
tolerance
.

We
thus
speculated
that
Mig6
regulates
cellular
death
.

Using
adenoviral
vectors
to
overexpress
or
knockdown
Mig6
,
we
found
that
caspase
3
activation
during
apoptosis
was
dependent
on
the
level
of
Mig6
.

Interestingly
,
Mig6
expression
was
induced
during
endoplasmic
reticulum
(
ER
)
stress
,
and
its
protein
levels
were
maintained
throughout
ER
stress
.

Using
polyribosomal
profiling
,
we
identified
that
Mig6
protein
translation
was
maintained
,
whereas
the
global
protein
translation
was
inhibited
during
ER
stress
.

In
addition
,
Mig6
overexpression
exacerbated
ER
stress-induced
caspase
3
activation
in
vitro
.

In
conclusion
,
Mig6
is
transcriptionally
up-regulated
and
resistant
to
global
translational
inhibition
during
stressed
conditions
in
β-cells
and
mediates
apoptosis
in
the
form
of
caspase
3
activation
.

The
sustained
production
of
Mig6
protein
exacerbates
ER
stress-induced
β-cell
death
.

Thus
,
preventing
the
induction
,
translation
,
and
/
or
function
of
Mig6
is
warranted
for
increasing
β-cell
survival
.
Congenital
hyperinsulinism
causes
persistent
hypoglycemia
in
neonates
and
infants
.

Most
often
,
uncontrolled
insulin
secretion
(
IS
)
results
from
a
lack
of
functional
KATP
channels
in
all
β-cells
or
only
in
β-cells
within
a
resectable
focal
lesion
.

In
more
rare
cases
,
without
KATP
channel
mutations
,
hyperfunctional
islets
are
confined
within
few
lobules
,
whereas
hypofunctional
islets
are
present
throughout
the
pancreas
.

They
also
can
be
cured
by
selective
partial
pancreatectomy;
however
,
unlike
those
with
a
KATP
focal
lesion
,
they
show
clinical
sensitivity
to
diazoxide
.

Here
,
we
characterized
in
vitro
IS
by
fragments
of
pathological
and
adjacent
normal
pancreas
from
six
such
cases
.

Responses
of
normal
pancreas
were
unremarkable
.

In
pathological
region
,
IS
was
elevated
at
1
mmol
/
L
and
was
further
increased
by
15
mmol
/
L
glucose
.

Diazoxide
suppressed
IS
and
tolbutamide
antagonized
the
inhibition
.

The
most
conspicuous
anomaly
was
a
large
stimulation
of
IS
by
1
mmol
/
L
glucose
.

In
five
of
six
cases
,
immunohistochemistry
revealed
undue
presence
of
low-Km
hexokinase-I
in
β-cells
of
hyperfunctional
islets
only
.

In
one
case
,
an
activating
mutation
of
glucokinase
(
I211F
)
was
found
in
pathological
islets
only
.

Both
abnormalities
,
attributed
to
somatic
genetic
events
,
may
account
for
inappropriate
IS
at
low
glucose
levels
by
a
subset
of
β-cells
.

in
C

(

)
,
we
now
present
parallel
data
on
the
responses
of
these
same
strains
to
several
commonly
used
pesticides
.

Some
of
these
,
like
dichlorvos
,
induced
multiple
stress
genes
in
a
concentration-dependent
manner
.

Unusually
,
endosulfan
induced
only
one
gene
(
cyp-34A9
)
to
very
high
levels
(
8-10-fold
)
even
at
the
lowest
test
concentration
,
with
a
clear
plateau
at
higher
doses
.

Other
pesticides
,
like
diuron
,
did
not
alter
reporter
gene
expression
detectably
even
at
the
highest
test
concentration
attainable
,
while
others
(
such
as
glyphosate
)
did
so
only
at
very
high
concentrations
.

We
have
also
used
five
responsive
GFP
reporters
to
investigate
the
toxicity
of
soil
pore
water

agricultural
sites
in

,
designated
P74

significantly
metal
contaminated
)
and
P73
(
used
for
growing
lettuce
,
but
with
only
background
levels
of
metals
)
.

Both
soil
pore
water
samples
induced
all
five
test
genes
to
varying
extents
,
yet
artificial
mixtures
containing
all
major
metals
present
had
essentially
no
effect
on
these
same
transgenes
.

Soluble
organic
contaminants
present
in
the
pore
water
were
extracted
with
acetone
and
dichloromethane
,
then
after
evaporation
of
the
solvents
,
the
organic
residues
were
redissolved
in
ultrapure
water
to
reconstitute
the
soluble
organic
components
of
the
original
soil
pore
water
.

These
organic
extracts
induced
transgene
expression
at
similar
or
higher
levels
than
the
original
pore
water
.

Addition
of
the
corresponding
metal
mixtures
had
either
no
effect
,
or
reduced
transgene
expression
towards
the
levels
seen
with
soil
pore
water
only
.

We
conclude
that
the
main
toxicants
present
in
these
soil
pore
water
samples
are
organic
rather
than
metallic
in
nature
.

Organic
extracts
from
a
control
standard
soil
(
Lufa
2
.
2
)
had
negligible
effects
on
expression
of
these
genes
,
and
similarly
several
pesticides
had
little
effect
on
the
expression
of
a
constitutive
myo-3
:
:
GFP
transgene
.

Both
the
P73
and
P74
sites
have
been
treated
regularly
with
(
undisclosed
)
pesticides
,
as
permitted
under
EU
regulations
,
though
other
(

industrial
)
organic
residues
may
also
be
present
.
All
nonsteroidal
antiinflammatory
drugs
(
NSAIDs
)
inhibit
the
cyclooxygenase
(
COX
)
isozymes
to
different
extents
,
which
accounts
for
their
anti-inflammatory
and
analgesic
activities
and
their
gastrointestinal
side
effects
.

We
have
exploited
biochemical
differences
between
the
two
COX
enzymes
to
identify
a
strategy
for
converting
carboxylate-containing
NSAIDs
into
selective
COX-2
inhibitors
.

Derivatization
of
the
carboxylate
moiety
in
moderately
selective
COX-1
inhibitors
,
such
as
5
,
8
,
11
,
14-eicosatetraynoic
acid
(
ETYA
)
and
arylacetic
and
fenamic
acid
NSAIDs
,
exemplified
by
indomethacin
and
meclofenamic
acid
,
respectively
,
generated
potent
and
selective
COX-2
inhibitors
.

In
the
indomethacin
series
,
esters
and
primary
and
secondary
amides
are
superior
to
tertiary
amides
as
selective
inhibitors
.

Only
the
amide
derivatives
of
ETYA
and
meclofenamic
acid
inhibit
COX-2;
the
esters
are
either
inactive
or
nonselective
.

Inhibition
kinetics
reveal
that
indomethacin
amides
behave
as
slow
,
tight-binding
inhibitors
of
COX-2
and
that
selectivity
is
a
function
of
the
time-dependent
step
.

Site-directed
mutagenesis
of
murine
COX-2
indicates
that
the
molecular
basis
for
selectivity
differs
from
the
parent
NSAIDs
and
from
diarylheterocycles
.

Selectivity
arises
from
novel
interactions
at
the
opening
and
at
the
apex
of
the
substrate-binding
site
.

Lead
compounds
in
the
present
study
are
potent
inhibitors
of
COX-2
activity
in
cultured
inflammatory
cells
.

Furthermore
,
indomethacin
amides
are
orally
active
,
nonulcerogenic
,
anti-inflammatory
agents
in
an
in
vivo
model
of
acute
inflammation
.

Expansion
of
this
approach
can
be
envisioned
for
the
modification
of
all
carboxylic
acid-containing
NSAIDs
into
selective
COX-2
inhibitors
.
The
presence
of
metabotropic
glutamate
receptors
(
mGluRs
)
of
group
II
modulating
glycine
exocytosis
from
glycinergic
nerve
endings
of
mouse
spinal
cord
was
investigated
.

Purified
synaptosomes
were
selectively
prelabeled
with
[
(

)
H
]
glycine
through
the
neuronal
transporter
GlyT2
and
subsequently
depolarized
by
superfusion
with
12
mM
KCl
.

The
selective
mGluR2
/
3
agonist
LY379268
inhibited
the
K
(

)
-evoked
overflow
of
[
(

)
H
]
glycine
in
a
concentration-dependent
manner
(
EC
(
50
)
about
0
.
2
nM
)
.

The
effect
of
LY379268
was
prevented
by
the
selective
mGluR2
/
3
antagonist
LY341495
(
IC
(
50
)
about
1
nM
)
.

N-acetylaspartylglutamate
(
NAAG
)
inhibited
[
(
3
)
H
]
glycine
overflow
with
extraordinary
potency
(
EC
(
50
)
about
50
fmol
)
.

In
contrast
,
glutamate
was
ineffective
up
to
0
.
1
nM
,
excluding
that
glutamate
contamination
of
commercial
NAAG
samples
is
responsible
for
the
reported
activity
of
NAAG
at
mGluR3
.

LY341495
antagonized
the
NAAG
inhibition
of
[
(
3
)
H
]
glycine
release
.

The
effect
of
a
combination
of
maximally
effective
concentrations
of
LY379268
and
NAAG
exhibited
no
additivity
.

The
non-hydrolysable
NAAG
analogue
N-acetylaspartyl-β-linked
glutamate
(
β-NAAG
)
antagonized
NAAG
and
LY379268
.

In
conclusion
,
our
results
show
that
glycinergic
nerve
endings
in
spinal
cord
are
endowed
with
group
II
mGluRs
mediating
inhibition
of
glycine
exocytosis
.

NAAG
can
activate
these
presynaptic
receptors
with
extremely
high
affinity
and
with
characteristics
compatible
with
the
reported
mGluR3
pharmacology
.

Although
many
functions
and
targets
have
been
attributed
to
the
histone
and
protein
deacetylase
SIRT1
,
a
comprehensive
analysis
of
SIRT1
binding
proteins
yielding
a
high-confidence
interaction
map
has
not
been
established
.

Using
a
comparative
statistical
analysis
of
binding
partners
,
we
have
assembled
a
high-confidence
SIRT1
interactome
.

Employing
this
method
,
we
identified
the
deubiquitinating
enzyme
ubiquitin-specific
protease
22
(
USP22
)
,
a
component
of
the
deubiquitinating
module
(
DUBm
)
of
the
SAGA
transcriptional
coactivating
complex
,
as
a
SIRT1-interacting
partner
.

We
found
that
this
interaction
is
highly
specific
,
requires
the
ZnF-UBP
domain
of
USP22
,
and
is
disrupted
by
the
inactivating
H363Y
mutation
within
SIRT1
.

Moreover
,
we
show
that
USP22
is
acetylated
on
multiple
lysine
residues
and
that
alteration
of
a
single
lysine
(
K129
)
within
the
ZnF-UBP
domain
is
sufficient
to
alter
interaction
of
the
DUBm
with
the
core
SAGA
complex
.

Furthermore
,
USP22-mediated
recruitment
of
SIRT1
activity
promotes
the
deacetylation
of
individual
SAGA
complex
components
.

Our
results
indicate
an
important
role
of
SIRT1-mediated
deacetylation
in
regulating
the
formation
of
DUBm
subcomplexes
within
the
larger
SAGA
complex
.
Despite
aggressive
treatment
with
radiation
and
chemotherapy
,
recurrence
of
glioblastoma
multiforme
(
GBM
)
is
inevitable
.

The
objective
of
this
study
was
to
show
that
the
blood-brain
barrier
(
BBB
)
,
through
a
combination
of
tight
junctions
and
active
efflux
transporters
in
the
brain
microvasculature
,
can
significantly
restrict
delivery
of
molecularly
targeted
agents
to
invasive
glioma
cells
.

Transgenic
mice
lacking
P-glycoprotein
(
P-gp
)
and
breast
cancer
resistance
protein
(
Bcrp
)
were
used
to
study
efflux
of
erlotinib
at
the
BBB
.

A
U87
rat
xenograft
model
of
GBM
was
used
to
investigate
the
regional
distribution
of
erlotinib
to
the
tumor
,
and
brain
regions
surrounding
the
tumor
.

The
effect
of
concurrent
administration
of
elacridar
on
regional
tumor
distribution
of
erlotinib
was
evaluated
.

We
show
that
erlotinib
transport
across
an
intact
BBB
is
significantly
restricted
due
to
P-gp-
and
Bcrp-mediated
efflux
transport
.

We
then
show
that
the
BBB
is
sufficiently
intact
in
areas
of
brain
adjacent
to
the
tumor
core
to
significantly
restrict
erlotinib
delivery
.

Inhibition
of
P-gp
and
Bcrp
by
the
dual
inhibitor
elacridar
dramatically
increased
erlotinib
delivery
to
the
tumor
core
,
rim
,
and
normal
brain
.

These
results
provide
conclusive
evidence
of
the
impact
that
active
efflux
at
the
BBB
has
on
the
delivery
of
molecularly
targeted
therapy
to
different
tumor
regions
in
glioma
.

These
data
also
support
the
possibility
that
the
repeated
failure
of
clinical
trials
of
new
drugs
for
gliomas
may
be
in
part
due
to
a
failure
to
achieve
effective
concentrations
in
invasive
tumor
cells
that
reside
behind
an
intact
BBB
.
The
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
investigate
the
neuroprotective
effect
of
a
water-soluble
formulation
of
coenzyme
Q10
(
WS-CoQ10
)
in
PC12
cells
exposed
to
cisplatin
,
a
chemotherapeutic
agent
with
a
dose-limiting
factor
due
to
neurotoxicity
.

In
the
cytokinesis-block
micronucleus
cytome
assay
(
CBMN
Cyt
)
,
WS-CoQ10
(
at
concentrations
of
0
.
1
,
0
.
5
and
1
.
0μgmL
(

)
)
protected
PC12
cells
from
cisplatin-induced
DNA
damage
(
0
.
1μgmL
(
-1
)
)
,
reducing
the
frequency
of
micronuclei
(
MNi
)
and
nuclear
buds
(
NBUDs
)
.

WS-CoQ10
did
not
alter
the
mRNA
expression
levels
of
Tp53
(
at
a
concentration
of
1
.
0μgmL
(
-1
)
)
and
exhibited
neuroprotective
activity
by
stimulating
cisplatin-inhibited
neurite
outgrowth
in
nerve
growth
factor
(
NGF
)
-differentiated
PC12
cells
(
at
a
concentration
of
0
.
1μgmL
(
-1
)
)
.

In
conclusion
,
WS-CoQ10
protected
the
PC12
cells
from
cisplatin-induced
DNA
damage
and
neurotoxicity
.

Moreover
,
the
neuroprotective
effects
of
WS-CoQ10
suggest
a
possible
application
in
chemotherapeutic
protocols
.
Neurodegenerative
diseases
are
complex
disorders
with
several
pathoetiological
pathways
leading
to
cell
death
.

Rationally
designed
multi-targeted
agents
,
or
"multi-targeted
designed
drugs"
(
MTDD
)
show
significant
promise
in
preclinical
studies
as
neuroprotective
and
disease-modifying
agents
.

In
this
review
,
we
highlight
the
use
of
chemical
scaffolds
that
lend
themselves
exquisitely
to
the
development
of
MTDDs
in
neurodegeneration
.

Notably
,
synthetic
polycyclic
cage
compounds
have
served
as
scaffolds
for
novel
voltage-gated
calcium
channel
blockers
,
NMDA
receptor
antagonists
,
and
sigma-receptor
ligands
-
attractive
targets
in
neurodegeneration
.

In
an
entirely
different
approach
,
compounds
containing
the
thiazolidinedione
moiety
(
referred
to
as
glitazones
)
alter
mitochondrial
function
through
the
mitochondrial
protein
mitoNEET
,
an
attractive
new
drug
target
for
the
treatment
of
neurodegenerative
diseases
.

The
design
strategy
for
yet
another
agent
,
ladostigil
,
employed
the
amalgamation
of
active
chemical
moieties
of
the
AChE
inhibitor
rivastigmine
,
and
the
monoamine
oxidase-B
(
MAO-B
)
inhibitor
rasagiline
,
leading
to
a
single
compound
that
targets
both
enzymes
simultaneously
.

Natural
products
have
also
served
as
design
templates
for
several
MTDD
design
studies
.

In
particular
,
the
stilbene
scaffold
has
become
popular
in
particular
due
to
the
neuroprotective
effects
of
the
non-flavonoid
natural
product
resveratrol
.

Recently
,
stilbene
scaffold-based
compounds
were
developed
to
reduce
-
through
chelation
with
metal
ions
that
interact
with
beta-amyloid
-
both
metal-induced
beta-amyloid
protein
aggregation
,
and
ROS
generated
from
this
aggregate
.

Other
subtle
modifications
of
the
stilbene
motif
led
to
the
creation
of
reversible
,
non-competitive
MAO
inhibitors
.

Finally
,
compounds
derived
from
the
xanthine
scaffold
afford
neuroprotection
in
Parkinson's
disease
through
mechanisms
that
include
dual
adenosine
A2A
receptor
antagonism
and
MAO-B
inhibition
.
Controversial
results
obtained
from
human
and
animal
studies
on
the
prevention
of
heart
disease
by
estrogens
and
progestins
warrant
a
better
understanding
of
nuclear
hormone
receptor
function
and
interaction
.

To
address
this
issue
and
taking
into
account
that
effects
of
synthetic
progestins
are
not
only
referable
to
action
through
the
progesterone
receptor
but
may
also
be
mediated
by
other
steroid
receptors
,
we
characterized
cardiovascular
function
and
inflammatory
gene
expression
in
aldosterone
salt-treated
rats
on
long-term
administration
of
17beta-estradiol
,
medroxyprogesterone
acetate
,
and
drospirenone
,
a
new
progestogen
exhibiting
antimineralocorticoid
activity
.

The
complex
pattern
of
cardiovascular
injury
in
ovariectomized
Wistar
rats
induced
by
chronic
aldosterone
infusion
plus
a
high-salt
diet
was
significantly
attenuated
in
sham-ovariectomized
rats
and
by
coadministration
of
17beta-estradiol
in
ovariectomized
animals
after
8
weeks
of
continuous
treatment
.

The
beneficial
role
of
17beta-estradiol
on
blood
pressure
,
cardiac
hypertrophy
,
vascular
osteopontin
expression
,
perivascular
fibrosis
,
and
impaired
NO-dependent
relaxation
of
isolated
aortic
rings
was
completely
abrogated
by
coadministration
of
medroxyprogesterone
acetate
.

In
contrast
,
drospirenone
was
either
neutral
or
additive
to
17beta-estradiol
in
protecting
against
aldosterone
salt-induced
cardiovascular
injury
and
inflammation
.

The
current
results
support
the
hypothesis
of
complex
interactions
among
estrogen
,
progesterone
,
glucocorticoid
,
androgen
,
and
mineralocorticoid
receptor
signaling
in
cardiovascular
injury
and
inflammation
.

Novel
progestins
,
such
as
drospirenone
,
confer
superior
effects
compared
with
medroxyprogesterone
acetate
in
a
model
of
aldosterone-induced
heart
disease
because
of
its
antimineralocorticoid
properties
.
We
have
cloned
the
cDNA
of
the
NDUFS5
subunit
(
15
kDa
)
of
the
human
mitochondrial
respiratory

complex
NADH
:
ubiquinone
oxidoreductase
(
complex

)
.

The
open

consists
of
321
base-pairs
,
coding
for
106
amino

,
with
a

5
kDa
.

There
is
an
81

0%
identity
with
the
bovine

cDNA
level
and
74
.
5%
identity
on

.

PCR
analysis
of
rodent-human
somatic
cell
hybrids
revealed
that
the
human
NDUFS5
gene
maps
to
chromosome
1
.

The
NDUFS5
mRNA
is
expressed
ubiquitously
in
human
tissues
,
with
a
relative
higher
expression
in
human
heart
,
skeletal
muscle
,
liver
,
kidney
and

.

A
mutation

study
of
twenty
isolated

I-deficient
patients
revealed
no

nor

.
Rofecoxib
is
a
selective
cyclo-oxygenase
(
COX
)
-2
inhibitor
which
has
little
or
no
effect
on
the
COX-1
isoenzyme
at
doses
up
to
1000
mg
/
day
.

Rofecoxib
has
greater
selectivity
for
COX-2
than
celecoxib
,
meloxicam
,
diclofenac
and
indomethacin
.

In
well-controlled
clinical
trials
,
rofecoxib
12
.
5
to
500
mg
/
day
has
been
evaluated
for
its
efficacy
in
the
treatment
of
osteoarthritis
,
acute
pain
and
rheumatoid
arthritis
[
lower
dosages
(
5
to
125
mg
/
day
)
were
generally
used
in
the
chronic
pain
indications
]
.

In
the
treatment
of
patients
with
osteoarthritis
,
rofecoxib
was
more
effective
in
providing
symptomatic
relief
than
placebo
,
paracetamol
(
acetaminophen
)
and
celecoxib
and
was
similar
in
efficacy
to
ibuprofen
,
diclofenac
,
naproxen
and
nabumetone
.

Overall
,
both
the
physician's
assessment
of
disease
status
and
the
patient's
assessment
of
response
to
therapy
tended
to
favour
rofecoxib
.

In
patients
with
postsurgical
dental
pain
,
pain
after
spinal
fusion
or
orthopaedic
surgery
,
or
primary
dysmenorrhoea
,
rofecoxib
provided
more
rapid
and
more
sustained
pain
relief
and
reduced
requirements
for
supplemental
morphine
use
after
surgery
than
placebo
.

Rofecoxib
was
more
efficacious
than
celecoxib
in
patients
with
acute
dental
pain
and
pain
after
spinal
fusion
surgery
,
although
celecoxib
may
have
been
used
at
a
subtherapeutic
dose
.

In
comparison
with
traditional
nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory
drugs
(
NSAIDs
)
ibuprofen
,
diclofenac
and
naproxen
sodium
,
rofecoxib
was
similar
in
efficacy
in
the
treatment
of
acute
pain
.

Although
naproxen
sodium
provided
more
rapid
pain
relief
than
rofecoxib
in
patients
with
primary
dysmenorrhoea
,
the
reverse
was
true
after
orthopaedic
surgery
:
rofecoxib
provided
more
rapid
pain
relief
and
less
supplemental
morphine
was
needed
.

Rofecoxib
was
as
effective
as
naproxen
in
providing
symptomatic
relief
for
over
8700
patients
with
rheumatoid
arthritis
.

Compared
with
traditional
NSAID
therapy
,
rofecoxib
had
a
significantly
lower
incidence
of
endoscopically
confirmed
gastroduodenal
ulceration
and
,
in
approximately
13
,
000
patients
with
osteoarthritis
and
rheumatoid
arthritis
,
a
lower
incidence
of
gastrointestinal
(
GI
)
adverse
events
.

Rofecoxib
was
generally
well
tolerated
in
all
indications
with
an
overall
tolerability
profile
similar
to
traditional
NSAIDs
.

The
most
common
adverse
events
in
rofecoxib
recipients
were
nausea
,
dizziness
and
headache
.

In
conclusion
,
rofecoxib
is
at
least
as
effective
as
traditional
NSAID
therapy
in
providing
pain
relief
for
both
chronic
and
acute

conditions
.

Rofecoxib
provides
an
alternative
treatment
option
to
traditional
NSAID
therapy
in
the
management
of
symptomatic
pain
relief
in
patients
with
osteoarthritis
.

Initial
data
from
patients
with
primary
dysmenorrhoea
and
postoperative
pain
are
promising
and
further
trials
may
confirm
its
place
in
the
treatment
of
these
indications
.

Rofecoxib
has
also
shown
promising
results
in
patients
with
rheumatoid
arthritis
and
is
likely
to
become
a
valuable
addition
to
current
drug
therapy
for
this
patient
population
.

Importantly
,
rofecoxib
is
associated
with
a
lower
incidence
of
GI
adverse
events
than
traditional
NSAIDs
making
it
a
primary
treatment
option
in
patients
at
risk
of
developing
GI
complications
or
patients
with
chronic
conditions
requiring
long
term
treatment
.

The
purpose
of
this

was
to
test
whether
an

significantly
blocked
the

E3-

3beta-Adiol-mediated
reduction
in
persistent
Ca2

is
associated
with
ER-beta-mediated
attenuation
of

First
,
we
prepared
phospholipid

at
different

The

as
well
as

The

Apple
polyphenol
extract
(
AP
)
and
procyanidin
contained
in
AP
were
investigated
for
their
immunomodulatory
effects
using
THP-1-derived
human
dendritic
cells
(
TDDCs
)
.

The
expression
levels
of
HLA-DR
(
MHC
class
II
)
and
CD86
(
costimulatory
molecule
)
were
measured
as
an
indicator
of
antigen
presentation
in
TDDCs
.

A
significant
decrease
in
HLA-DR
expression
was
observed
in
the
AP
and
fractionated
procyanidin-treated
cells
in
the
presence
of
ovalbumin
(
OVA
)
,
but
no
effect
on
CD86
expression
was
observed
.

The
uptake
of
OVA
was
not
inhibited
by
AP
treatment
,
and
the
gene
expression
of
membrane-associated
RING-CH
ubiquitin
E3
ligase
,
MARCH1
,
was
up-regulated
by
AP
treatment
.

It
can
therefore
be
presumed
that
AP
suppresses
HLA-DR
expression
via
the
ubiquitin-proteasome
pathway
.

Furthermore
,
the
up-regulation
of
IL-12
and
TNF-α
was
found
in
the
procyanidin
trimers-treated
cells
in
the
presence
of
OVA
.

These
results
suggest
that
apple
polyphenols
would
be
an
effective
factor
for
the
development
of
immunomodulatory
agents

suppressive

is
an

AFUEI
is
an
inhibitor
of
the
elastase
derived
from
Aspergillus
fumigatus
.

AFUEI
is
a
member
of
the
I78
inhibitor
family
,
and
has
a
high
inhibitory
activity
against
elastases
of
Aspergillus

and
Aspergillus
flavus
,
human
neutrophil
elastase
and
bovine

,
but
does
not

Here
we
report
the
crystal
structure
of
AFUEI
in
two
crystal
forms
.

AFUEI
is
a
wedge-shaped
protein
composed
of
an
extended
loop
and
a

core
.

The
structure
of
AFUEI
shows
remarkable
similarity
to
serine
protease
inhibitors
of
the
potato
inhibitor
I
family
,
although
they
are
classified
into
different
inhibitor
families
.

A
structural
comparison
with
the
potato
I
family
inhibitors
suggests
that
the
extended
loop
of
AFUEI
corresponds
to
the
binding
loop
of
the
potato
inhibitor
I
family
and
AFUEI
inhibits
its
cognate
proteases
through
the

mechanism
as
the
Potato

Genistin
belongs
to
isoflavones
.

Based
on
the
facts
that
genistin
exerts
inhibitory
effects
on
the
contractility
of
vascular
smooth
muscle
,
the
present
study
was
designed
to
characterize
the
effects
of
genistin
on
intestinal
contractility
and
evaluate
its
potential
clinical
implication
.

Ex
vivo
[
isolated
jejunal
segment
(
IJS
)
of
rat
]
,
in
vitro
,
and
in
vivo
assays
were
used
in
the
study
.

The
results
indicated
that
genistin
(
5-80
μmol
/
L
)
inhibited
the
contraction
of
IJS
in
a
dose-dependent
manner
and
inhibited
the
increased-contractility
of
IJS
induced
by
acetylcholine
(
ACh
)
,
histamine
,
high
Ca
(
2
+
)
,
and
erythromycin
,
respectively
.

The
inhibitory
effects
of
genistin
were
correlated
with
the
stimulation
of
alpha
adrenergic
and
beta
adrenergic
receptors
since
these
inhibitory
effects
were
significantly
blocked
in
the
presence
of
phentolamine
and
propranolol
respectively
.

No
further
inhibitory
effects
of
genistin
were
observed
in
the
presence
of
verapamil
or
in
Ca
(
2
+
)
-free
condition
,
indicating
genistin-induced
inhibitory
effects
are
Ca
(
2
+
)
-dependent
.

Genistin
decreased
myosin
light
chain
kinase
(
MLCK

MLCK
mRNA
expression
in
IJS
,
and
inhibited
both
phosphorylation
and
Mg
(

-ATPase
activity
of
purified
myosin
,
implicating
that
the
decrease
of
MLCK
contents
and
inhibition
of
MLCK
activity
are
involved
in
the
genistin-induced
inhibitory
effects
.

study
suggests

P-glycoprotein
(
P-gp
)
is
an
efflux
pump
belonging
to
the
ATP-binding
cassette
transporter
superfamily
expressed
in
several
organs
.

Considering
its
potential
protective
effects
,
the
induction
of
de
novo
synthesis
of
P-gp
could
be
used
therapeutically
in
the
treatment
of
intoxications
by
its
substrates
.

The
herbicide
paraquat
(
PQ
)
is
a
P-gp
substrate
responsible
for
thousands
of
fatal
intoxications
worldwide
that
still
lacks
an
effective
antidote
.

The
aim
of
the
present
work
was
to
evaluate
the
effectiveness
of
such
an
antidote
by
testing
whether
doxorubicin
(
DOX
)
,
a
known
P-gp
inducer
,
could
efficiently
protect
Caco-2
cells
against
PQ
cytotoxicity
,
6
h
after
the
incubation
with
the
herbicide
,
reflecting
a
real-life
intoxication
scenario
.

Cytotoxicity
was
evaluated
by
the
MTT
assay
and
PQ
intracellular
concentrations
were
measured
by
gas
chromatography-ion
trap-mass
spectrometry
(
GC-IT-MS
)
.

Also
,
the
DOX
modulatory
effect
on
choline
uptake
transport
system
was
assessed
by
measuring
the
uptake
of
[
³H
]
-choline
.

The
results
show
that
DOX
exerts
protective
effects
against
PQ
cytotoxicity
,
preventing
the
intracellular
accumulation
of
the
herbicide
.

These
protective
effects
were
not
completely
prevented
by
the
incubation
with
the
UIC2
antibody
,
a
specific
P-gp
inhibitor
,
suggesting
the
involvement
of
alternative
protection
mechanisms
.

In
fact
,
DOX
also
efficiently
inhibited
the
choline
transport
system
that
influences
PQ
cellular
uptake
.

In
conclusion
,
in
this
cellular
model
,
DOX
effectively
protects
against
PQ
toxicity
by
inducing
P-gp
and
through
the
interaction
with
the
choline
transporter
,
suggesting
that
compounds
presenting
this
double
feature
of
promoting
the
efflux
and
limiting
the
uptake
of
PQ
could
be
used
as
effective
antidotes
to
treat
intoxications

The
structure-activity
relationships
of
parabens
which
are
widely
used
as
preservatives
for
transcriptional
activities
mediated
by
human
estrogen
receptor
α
(
hERα
)
,
hERβ
and
androgen
receptor
(
hAR
)
were
investigated
.

Fourteen
of
17
parabens
exhibited
hERα
and
/
or
hERβ
agonistic
activity
at
concentrations
of
⩽1×10
(
-5
)
M
,
whereas
none
of
the
17
parabens
showed
AR
agonistic
or
antagonistic
activity
.

Among
12
parabens
with
linear
alkyl
chains
ranging
in
length
from
C1
to
C12
,
heptylparaben
(
C7
)
and
pentylparaben
(
C5
)
showed
the
most
potent
ERα
and
ERβ
agonistic
activity
in
the
order
of
10
(
-7
)
M
and
10
(
-8
)
M
,
respectively
,
and
the
activities
decreased
in
a
stepwise
manner
as
the
alkyl
chain
was
shortened
to
C1
or
lengthened
to
C12
.

Most
parabens
showing
estrogenic
activity
exhibited
ERβ-agonistic
activity
at
lower
concentrations
than
those
inducing
ERα-agonistic
activity
.

The
estrogenic
activity
of
butylparaben
was
markedly
decreased
by
incubation
with
rat
liver
microsomes
,
and
the
decrease
of
activity
was
blocked
by
a
carboxylesterase
inhibitor
.

These
results
indicate
that
parabens
are
selective
agonists
for
ERβ
over
ERα;
their
interactions
with
ERα
/
β
are
dependent
on
the
size
and
bulkiness
of
the
alkyl
groups;
and
they
are
metabolized
by
carboxylesterases
,
leading
to
attenuation
of
their
estrogenic
activity
.
Biological
activity
of
natural
retinoids
requires
the
oxidation
of
retinol
to
retinoic
acid
(
RA
)
and
its
binding
to
specific
nuclear
receptors
in
target
tissues
.

The
first
step
of
this
pathway
,
the
reversible
oxidoreduction
of
retinol
to
retinaldehyde
,
is
essential
to
control
RA
levels
.

The
enzymes
of
retinol
oxidation
are
NAD-dependent
dehydrogenases
of
the
cytosolic
medium-chain
(
MDR
)
and
the
membrane-bound
short-chain
(
SDR
)
dehydrogenases
/
reductases
.

Retinaldehyde
reduction
can
be
performed
by
SDR
and
aldo-keto
reductases
(
AKR
)
,
while
its
oxidation
to
RA
is
carried
out
by
aldehyde
dehydrogenases
(
ALDH
)
.

In
contrast
to
SDR
,
AKR
and
ALDH
are
cytosolic
.

A
common
property
of
these
enzymes
is
that
they
only
use
free
retinoid
,
but
not
retinoid
bound
to
cellular
retinol
binding
protein
(
CRBP
)
.

The
relative
contribution
of
each
enzyme
type
in
retinoid
metabolism
is
discussed
in
terms
of
the
different
subcellular
localization
,
topology
of
membrane-bound
enzymes
,
kinetic
constants
,
binding
affinity
of
CRBP
for
retinol
and
retinaldehyde
,
and
partition
of
retinoid
pools
between
membranes
and
cytoplasm
.

The
development
of
selective
inhibitors
for
AKR
enzymes
1B1
and
1B10
,
of
clinical
relevance
in
diabetes
and
cancer
,
granted
the
investigation
of
some
structure-activity
relationships
.

Kinetics
with
the
4-methyl
derivatives
of
retinaldehyde
isomers
was
performed
to
identify
structural
features
for
substrate
specificity
.

Hydrophilic
derivatives
were
better
substrates
than
the
more
hydrophobic
compounds
.

We
also
explored
the
inhibitory
properties
of
some
synthetic
retinoids
,
known
for
binding
to
retinoic
acid
receptors
(
RAR
)
and
retinoid
X
receptors
(
RXR
)
.

Consistent
with
its
substrate
specificity
towards
retinaldehyde
,
AKR1B10
was
more
effectively
inhibited
by
synthetic
retinoids
than
AKR1B1
.

A
RARβ
/
γ
agonist
(
UVI2008
)
inhibited
AKR1B10
with
the
highest
potency
and
selectivity

Clinical
investigations
highlight
the
increased
incidence
of
metabolic
syndrome
in
prostate
cancer
(
PCa
)
patients
receiving
androgen
deprivation
therapy
(
ADT
)
.

Studies
using
global
androgen
receptor
(
AR
)
knockout
mice
demonstrate
that
AR
deficiency
results
in
the
development
of
insulin
resistance
in
males
.

However
,
mechanisms
by
which
AR
in
individual
organs
coordinately
regulates
insulin
sensitivity
remain
unexplored
.

Here
we
tested
the
hypothesis
that
functional
AR
in
the
brain
contributes
to
whole-body
insulin
sensitivity
regulation
and
to
the
metabolic
abnormalities
developed
in
AR-deficient
male
mice
.

The
mouse
model
selectively
lacking
AR
in
the
central
nervous
system
and
AR-expressing
GT1-7
neuronal
cells
were
established
and
used
to
delineate
molecular
mechanisms
in
insulin
signaling
modulated
by
AR
.

Neuronal
AR
deficiency
leads
to
reduced
insulin
sensitivity
in
middle-aged
mice
.

Neuronal
AR
regulates
hypothalamic
insulin
signaling
by
repressing
nuclear
factor-κB
(
NF-κB
)
-mediated
induction
of
protein-tyrosine
phosphatase
1B
(
PTP1B
)
.

Hypothalamic
insulin
resistance
leads
to
hepatic
insulin
resistance
,
lipid
accumulation
,
and
visceral
obesity
.

The
functional
deficiency
of
AR
in
the
hypothalamus
leads
to
male
mice
being
more
susceptible
to
the
effects
of
high-fat
diet
consumption
on
PTP1B
expression
and
NF-κB
activation
.

These
findings
suggest
that
in
men
with
PCa
undergoing
ADT
,
reduction
of
AR
function
in
the
brain
may
contribute
to
insulin
resistance
and
visceral
obesity
.

Pharmacotherapies
targeting
neuronal
AR
and
NF-κB
may
be
developed
to
combat
the
metabolic
syndrome
in
men
receiving
ADT
and
in
elderly
men
with
age-associated
hypogonadism
.

By
2030
,
nearly
half
of
Americans
will
have
nonalcoholic
fatty
liver
disease
.

In
part
,
this
epidemic
is
fueled
by
the
increasing
consumption
of
caloric
sweeteners
coupled
with
an
innate
capacity
to
convert
sugar
into
fat
via
hepatic
de
novo
lipogenesis
.

In
addition
to
serving
as
substrates
,
monosaccharides
also
increase
the
expression
of
key
enzymes
involved
in
de
novo
lipogenesis
via
the
carbohydrate
response
element-binding
protein
(
ChREBP
)
.

To
determine
whether
ChREBP
is
a
potential
therapeutic
target
,
we
decreased
hepatic
expression
of
ChREBP
with
a
specific
antisense
oligonucleotide
(
ASO
)
in
male
Sprague-Dawley
rats
fed
either
a
high-fructose
or
high-fat
diet
.

ChREBP
ASO
treatment
decreased
plasma
triglyceride
concentrations
compared
with
control
ASO
treatment
in
both
diet
groups
.

The
reduction
was
more
pronounced
in
the
fructose-fed
group
and
attributed
to
decreased
hepatic
expression
of
ACC2
,
FAS
,
SCD1
,
and
MTTP
and
a
decrease
in
the
rate
of
hepatic
triglyceride
secretion
.

This
was
associated
with
an
increase
in
insulin-stimulated
peripheral
glucose
uptake
,
as
assessed
by
the
hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic
clamp
.

In
contrast
,
ChREBP
ASO
did
not
alter
hepatic
lipid
content
or
hepatic
insulin
sensitivity
.

Interestingly
,
fructose-fed
rats
treated
with
ChREBP
ASO
had
increased
plasma
uric
acid
,
alanine
transaminase
,
and
aspartate
aminotransferase
concentrations
.

This
was
associated
with
decreased
expression
of
fructose
aldolase
and
fructokinase
,
reminiscent
of
inherited
disorders
of
fructose
metabolism
.

In
summary
,
these
studies
suggest
that
targeting
ChREBP
may
prevent
fructose-induced
hypertriglyceridemia
but
without
the
improvements
in
hepatic
steatosis
and
hepatic
insulin
responsiveness
.
Cellular
signaling
crosstalk
between
multiple
receptors
for
investigation
of
pathophysiology
in
multifactorial
diseases--what
is
clinically-relevant
OBJECTIVE
:
Although
low
serum
testosterone
(
T
)
is
associated
with
metabolic
disorders
,
the
mechanism
of
this
association
is
unclear
.

The
objective
of
the
present
study
was
to
investigate
the
combined
effects
of
T
deficiency
and
a
high-fat
diet
(
HFD
)
on
hepatic
lipid
homeostasis
in
mice
.

MATERIALS
/
METHODS
:
Orchiectomized
(
ORX
)
mice
and
sham-operated
(
SHAM
)
mice
were
randomly
divided
into
five
groups
:
SHAM
mice
fed
a
standard
diet
(
SD
)
,
SHAM
mice
fed
HFD
,
ORX
mice
fed
SD
,
ORX
mice
fed
HFD
,
and
ORX
mice
fed
HFD
with
T
supplementation
.

After
4weeks
of
treatment
,
we
investigated
the
synthesis
and
secretion
of
lipids
in
the
liver
and
detailed
serum
lipoprotein
profiles
in
each
group
.

RESULTS
:
ORX
mice
fed
HFD
showed
increased
hepatic
steatosis
,
markedly
decreased
serum
triglyceride
(
TG
)
and
TG-VLDL
content
,
and
increased
serum
very
small-LDL
content
.

Gene
expression
analysis
revealed
that
ORX
mice
fed
HFD
showed
significantly
decreased
expression
of
microsomal
triglyceride
transfer
protein
,
lipin-1
,
peroxisome
proliferator-activated
receptor
(
PPAR
)
-α
and
PPAR-γ
coactivator
1-α
,
and
significantly
increased
sterol
regulatory
element-binding
protein-1
,
diacylglycerol
acyltransferase-2
and
fatty
acid
synthase
.

Reduction
of
hepatic
AMPK
phosphorylation
was
observed
in
ORX
mice
fed
HFD
.

These
perturbations
in
ORX
mice
fed
HFD
were
normalized
to
the
levels
of
SHAM
mice
fed
HFD
by
T
supplementation
.

CONCLUSION
:
T
deficiency
is
associated
with
failure
of
lipid
homeostasis
mediated
by
altered
expression
of
genes
involved
in
hepatic
assembly
and
secretion
of
lipids
.
Pranlukast
is
a
selective
cysteinyl
leukotriene
(

)
(
cysLT
(
1
)
)
receptor
antagonist
,
and
is
now
widely
used
in
the
treatment
of
asthma
.

The
anti-asthmatic
effect
of
pranlukast
may
be
rendered
not
only
by
antileukotriene
activity
,
but
also
by
other
pharmacological
activity
.

This
study
was
designed
to
investigate
whether
pranlukast
had
inhibitory
effects
on
nuclear
factor-kappaB
(
NF-kappaB
)
activation
and
mucin
gene
expression
in
cultured
human
epithelial
cells
.

Luciferase
assay
was
mainly
used
for
analysis
.

Cultured
epithelial
cells
were
transfected
with
NF-kappaB
luciferase
vector
,
MUC2
or
MUC5AC
luciferase
vectors
.

Lipopolysaccharide
(
LPS
)
significantly
increased
NF-kappaB
activation
in
NCI-H292
cells
,
which
was
inhibited
by
the
pretreatment
by
pranlukast
in
a
dose-dependent
manner
.

Either
LTD
(
4
)
or
pranlukast
alone
did
not
increase
NF-kappaB
activation
in
NCI-H292
cells
.

Pranlukast
also
inhibited
NF-kappaB
activation
induced
by
phorbol
12-myristate
13-acetate
(
PMA
)
.

Pranlukast
also
significantly
inhibited
LPS-induced
MUC2
mRNA
expression
by
reverse
transcription-polymerase
chain
reaction
(
RT-PCR
)
analysis
in
NCI-H292
cells
.

Pranlukast
also
inhibited
LPS-induced
MUC2
gene
expression
in
HM3-MUC2
cells
.

However
,
pranlukast
did
not
inhibit
MUC5AC
gene
transcription
activity
induced
by
lipoteichoic
acid
(
LTA
)
in
NCI-H292
cells
.

These
results
suggest
that
pranlukast
may
inhibit
NF-kappaB
activation
and
MUC2
gene
transcription
through
pathways
distinct
from
cysLT
(
1
)
receptor
antagonism
in
cultured
human

Iron-sulphur
(
[
Fe-S
]
)
clusters
are
simple
inorganic
prosthetic
groups
that
are
contained
in
a
variety
of
proteins
having
functions
related
to
electron
transfer
,
gene
regulation
,
environmental
sensing
and
substrate
activation
.

In
spite
of
their
simple
structures
,
biological
[
Fe-S
]
clusters
are
not
formed
spontaneously
.

Rather
,
a
consortium
of
highly
conserved
proteins
is
required
for
both
the
formation
of
[
Fe-S
]
clusters
and
their
insertion
into
various
protein
partners
.

Among
the
[
Fe-S
]
cluster
biosynthetic
proteins
are
included
a
pyridoxal
phosphate-dependent
enzyme
(
NifS
)
that
is
involved
in
the
activation
of
sulphur
from
l-cysteine
,
and
a
molecular
scaffold
protein
(
NifU
)
upon
which
[
Fe-S
]
cluster
precursors
are
formed
.

The
formation
or
transfer
of
[
Fe-S
]
clusters
appears
to
require
an
electron-transfer
step
.

Another
complexity
is
that
molecular
chaperones
homologous
to
DnaJ
and
DnaK
are
involved
in
some
aspect
of
the
maturation
of
[
Fe-S
]
-cluster-containing
proteins
.

It
appears
that
the
basic
biochemical
features
of
[
Fe-S
]
cluster
formation
are
strongly
conserved
in
Nature
,
since
organisms
from
all
three
life
Kingdoms
contain
the
same
consortium
of
homologous
proteins
required
for
[
Fe-S

cluster
formation
that

Quinones
present
in
the
traffic-related
PM
are
hypothesized
to
contribute
to
these
harmful
effects
through
reactive
oxygen
species
(
ROS
)
generation
.

However
,
the
impacts
of
the
traffic-related
PM
and
quinones
on
inflammatory
processes
and
genotoxic
damages
are
less
well
known
.

In
present
study
we
aimed
to
examine
the
genotoxic
and
inflammatory
impacts
of
organic
extracts
from
traffic-related
PM
(
oTRP
)
in
human
lung
epithelial
A549
cells
,
and
reveal
the
contributions
from
quinones
.

Significant
cytotoxicity
and
DNA
damage
were
caused
by
oTRP
.

The
pro-inflammatory
genes
,
interleukin-6
(
Il-6
)
,
interleukin-8
(
Il-8
)
and
tumor
necrosis
factor
(
Tnf
)
,
and
two
aromatic
hydrocarbon
receptor-regulated
genes
,
Cyp1a1
and
1b1
,
were
significantly
up-regulated
by
oTRP
.

A
concomitant
increase
in
ROS
was
observed
,
suggesting
that
oTRP
may
mediate
genotoxic
and
inflammatory
effects
through
oxidative
stress
pathway
.

Second
,
the
effects
from
two
typical
airborne
quinones
,
9
,
10-anthraquinone
(
AQ
)
and
1
,
4-naphthroquinone
(
NQ
)
were
compared
.

NQ
,
but
not
AQ
,
induced
significant
DNA
damage
in
A549
cells
.

NQ
up-regulated
Il-8
,
Tnf
,
and
Mcp-1
genes
,
while
AQ
induced
the
expression
of
Rantes
gene
.

These
results
suggest
that
the
NQ
and
AQ
may
participate
in
the
pro-inflammatory
responses
through
releasing
different
types
of
cytokines
/

BACKGROUND
:
The
use
of
beta-blockers
has
emerged
as
a
beneficial
treatment
for
congestive
heart
failure
.

Hypoxia-inducible
factor-1alpha
(
HIF-1alpha
)
is
tightly
regulated
in
the
ventricular
myocardium
.

However
,
the
expression
of
HIF-1alpha
in
chronic
heart
failure
resulting
from
volume
overload
and
after
treatment
with
beta-blocker
is
little
known
.

METHODS
AND
RESULTS
:
To
test
the
hypothesis
that
HIF-1alpha
plays
a
role
in
the
failing
myocardium
because
of
volume
overload
,
an
aorta-caval
shunt
was
created
for
4
weeks
in
adult
Sprague-Dawley
rats
to
induce
volume-overload
heart
failure
.

Carvedilol
at
50
mg
/
kg
body
weight
per
day
after
surgery
was
given
.

The
heart
weight
and
body
weight
ratio
increased
from
2
.
6
+
/
-
0
.
3
in
the
sham
group
to
3
.
9
+
/
-
0
.
7
(
P
<
.
001
)
in
the
shunt
group
.

Left
ventricular
end-diastolic
dimension
increased
from
6
.
5
+
/
-
0
.
5
mm
to
8
.
7
+
/
-
0
.
6
mm
(
P
<
.
001
)
.

Treatment
with
carvedilol
in
the
shunt
group
reversed
the
heart
weight
and
ventricular
dimension
to
the
baseline
values
.

Western
blot
showed
that
HIF-1alpha
,
vascular
endothelial
growth
factor
(
VEGF
)
,
and
brain
natriuretic
peptide
(
BNP
)
proteins
were
upregulated
and
nerve
growth
factor-beta
(
NGF-beta
)
downregulated
in
the
shunt
group
.

Real-time
polymerase
chain
reaction
showed
that
mRNA
of
HIF-1alpha
,
VEGF
,
and
BNP
increased
and
mRNA
of
NGF-beta
decreased
in
the
shunt
group
.

Treatment
with
carvedilol
reversed
both
protein
and
mRNA
of
HIF-1alpha
,
VEGF
,
BNP
,
and
NGF-beta
to
the
baseline
values
.

Increased
immunohistochemical
labeling
of
HIF-1alpha
,
VEGF
,
and
BNP
in
the
ventricular
myocardium
was
observed
in
the
shunt
group
and
carvedilol
again
normalized
the
labeling
.

CONCLUSION
:
HIF-1alpha
and
VEGF
mRNA
and
protein
expression
were
upregulated
in
the
rat
model
of
volume-overload
heart
failure
.

Treatment
with
carvedilol
is
associated
with
a
reversal
of
abnormal
regulation
of
HIF-1alpha
and
VEGF
in
the
failing
ventricular
myocardium
.
Saccharopine
dehydrogenase
[
N6-
(
glutaryl-2
)
-L-lysine
:
NAD
oxidoreductase
(
L-lysine
forming
)
]
catalyzes
the
final
step
in
the
alpha-aminoadipate
pathway
for
lysine
biosynthesis
.

It
catalyzes
the
reversible
pyridine
nucleotide-dependent
oxidative
deamination
of
saccharopine
to
generate
alpha-Kg
and
lysine
using
NAD
+
as
an
oxidizing
agent
.

The
proton
shuttle
chemical
mechanism
is
proposed
on
the
basis
of
the
pH
dependence
of
kinetic
parameters
,
dissociation
constants
for
competitive
inhibitors
,
and
isotope
effects
.

In
the
direction
of
lysine
formation
,
once
NAD
+
and
saccharopine
bind
,
a
group
with
a
pKa
of
6
.
2
accepts
a
proton
from
the
secondary
amine
of
saccharopine
as
it
is
oxidized
.

This
protonated
general
base
then
does
not
participate
in
the
reaction
again
until
lysine
is
formed
at
the
completion
of
the
reaction
.

A
general
base
with
a
pKa
of
7
.
2
accepts
a
proton
from
H2O
as
it
attacks
the
Schiff
base
carbon
of
saccharopine
to
form
the
carbinolamine
intermediate
.

The
same
residue
then
serves
as
a
general
acid
and
donates
a
proton
to
the
carbinolamine
nitrogen
to
give
the
protonated
carbinolamine
.

Collapse
of
the
carbinolamine
is
then
facilitated
by
the
same
group
accepting
a
proton
from
the
carbinolamine
hydroxyl
to
generate
alpha-Kg
and
lysine
.

The
amine
nitrogen
is
then
protonated
by
the
group
that
originally
accepted
a
proton
from
the
secondary
amine
of
saccharopine
,
and
products
are
released
.

In
the
reverse
reaction
direction
,
finite
primary
deuterium
kinetic
isotope
effects
were
observed
for
all
parameters
with
the
exception
of
V2
/
K
(
NADH
)
,
consistent
with
a
steady-state
random
mechanism
and
indicative
of
a
contribution
from
hydride
transfer
to
rate
limitation
.

The
pH
dependence
,
as
determined
from
the
primary
isotope
effect
on
DV2
and
D
(
V2
/
K
(
Lys
)
)
,
suggests
that
a
step
other
than
hydride
transfer
becomes
rate-limiting
as
the
pH
is
increased
.

This
step
is
likely
protonation
/
deprotonation
of
the
carbinolamine
nitrogen
formed
as
an
intermediate
in
imine
hydrolysis
.

The
observed
solvent
isotope
effect
indicates
that
proton
transfer
also
contributes
to
rate
limitation
.

A
concerted
proton
and
hydride
transfer
is
suggested
by
multiple
substrate
/
solvent
isotope
effects
,
as
well
as
a
proton
transfer
in
another
step
,
likely
hydrolysis
of
the
carbinolamine
.

In
agreement
,
dome-shaped
proton
inventories
are
observed
for
V2
and
V2
/
K
(
Lys
)
,
suggesting
that
proton
transfer
exists
in
at
least
two
sequential
transition
states
.

an
aldose
reductase
inhibitor
(
ARI
)
of
the
carboxylic
acid
type
.

Here
,
the
X-ray
structure
of
the
complex
of
the
V301L
substituted
AKR1B10
holoenzyme
with
fidarestat
,
an
ARI
of
the
cyclic
imide
type
,
was
obtained
at
1
.
60Å
resolution
by
replacement
soaking
of
crystals
containing
tolrestat
.

Previously
,
fidarestat
was
found
to
be
safe
in
phase
III
trials
for
diabetic
neuropathy
and
,
consistent
with
its
low
in
vivo
side
effects
,
was
highly
selective
for
aldose
reductase
(
AR
or
AKR1B1
)
versus
aldehyde
reductase
(
AKR1A1
)
.

Now
,
inhibition
studies
showed
that
fidarestat
was
indeed
1300-fold
more
selective
for
AR
as
compared
to
AKR1B10
,
while
the
change
of
Val
to
Leu
(
found
in
AR
)
caused
a
20-fold
decrease
in
the
IC50
value
with
fidarestat
.

Structural
analysis
of
the
V301L
AKR1B10-fidarestat
complex
displayed
enzyme-inhibitor
interactions
similar
to
those
of
the
AR-fidarestat
complex
.

However
,
a
close
inspection
of
both
the
new
crystal
structure
and
a
computer
model
of
the
wild-type
AKR1B10
complex
with
fidarestat
revealed
subtle
changes
that
could
affect
fidarestat
binding
.

In
the
crystal
structure
,
a
significant
motion
of
loop
A
was
observed
between
AR
and
V301L
AKR1B10
,
linked
to
a
Phe-122
/
Phe-123
side
chain
displacement
.

This
was
due
to
the
presence
of
the
more
voluminous
Gln-303
side
chain
(
Ser-302
in
AR
)
and
of
a
water
molecule
buried
in
a
subpocket
located
at
the
base
of
flexible
loop
A
.

In
the
wild-type
AKR1B10
model
,
a
short
contact
was
predicted
between
the
Val-301
side
chain
and
fidarestat
,
but
would
not
be
present
in
AR
or
in
V301L
AKR1B10
.

Overall
,
these
changes
could
contribute
to
the
difference
in
inhibitory
potency
of
fidarestat
between
AR
and
AKR1B10
.
The
discovery
of
CXCR7
as
a
new
receptor
for
SDF-1
places
many
previously
described
SDF-1
functions
attributed
to
CXCR4
in
question
,
though
whether
CXCR7
acts
as
a
signaling
or
decoy
receptor
has
been
in
debate
.

It
is
known
that
CXCR7
is
not
expressed
in
normal
blood
leukocytes;
however
,
the
potential
role
of
leukocyte
CXCR7
in
disease
states
has
not
been
addressed
.

The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
determine
the
expression
and
function
of
macrophage
CXCR7
linked
to
atherosclerosis
.

Here
,
we
show
that
CXCR7
was
detected
in
macrophage-positive
area
of
aortic
atheroma
of
ApoE-null
mice
,
but
not
in
healthy
aorta
.

During
monocytes
differentiation
to
macrophages
,
CXCR7
was
up-regulated
at
mRNA
and
protein
levels
,
with
more
expression
in
M1
than
in
M2
phenotype
.

In
addition
,
CXCR7
induction
was
associated
with
a
SDF-1
signaling
switch
from
the
pro-survival
ERK
and
AKT
pathways
in
monocytes
to
the
pro-inflammatory
JNK
and
p38
pathways
in
macrophages
.

The
latter
effect
was
mimicked
by
a
CXCR7-selective
agonist
TC14012
and
abolished
by
siRNA
knockdown
of
CXCR7
.

Furthermore
,
CXCR7
activation
increased
macrophage
phagocytic
activity
,
which
was
suppressed
by
CXCR7
siRNA
silencing
or
by
inhibiting
either
the
JNK
or
p38
pathways
,
but
was
not
affected
by
blocking
CXCR4
.

Finally
,
activation
of
CXCR7
by
I-TAC
showed
a
similar
signaling
and
phagocytic
activity
in
macrophages
with
no
detectable
CXCR3
.

We
conclude
that
CXCR7
is
induced
during
monocyte-to-macrophage
differentiation
,
which
is
required
for
SDF-1
and
I-TAC
signaling
to
JNK
and
p38
pathways
,
leading
to
enhanced
macrophage
phagocytosis
,
thus
possibly
contributing
to
atherogenesis
.

Efficacy
of

in

was
dose-dependent

,
lumiracoxib
at

Increased
levels
of
free
fatty
acids
(
FFAs
)
,
specifically
saturated
free
fatty
acids
such
as
palmitate
are
associated
with
insulin
resistance
of
muscle
,
fat
and
liver
.

Skeletal
muscle
,
responsible
for
up
to
80%
of
the
glucose
disposal
from
the
peripheral
circulation
,
is
particularly
vulnerable
to
increased
levels
of
saturated
FFAs
.

Rooibos
(
Aspalathus
linearis
)
and
its
unique
dihydrochalcone
C-glucoside
,
aspalathin
,
shown
to
reduce
hyperglycemia
in
diabetic
rats
,
could
play
a
role
in
preventing
or
ameliorating
the
development
of
insulin
resistance
.

This
study
aims
to
establish
whether
rooibos
can
ameliorate
experimentally-induced
insulin-resistance
in
C2C12
skeletal
muscle
cells
.

Palmitate-induced
insulin
resistant
C2C12
cells
were
treated
with
an
aspalathin-enriched
green
(
unfermented
)
rooibos
extract
(
GRE
)
,
previously
shown
for
its
blood
glucose
lowering
effect
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
or
an
aqueous
extract
of
fermented
rooibos
(
FRE
)
.

Glucose
uptake
and
mitochondrial
activity
were
measured
using
2-deoxy-
[
(
3
)
H
]
-d-glucose
,
MTT
and
ATP
assays
,
respectively
.

Expression
of
proteins
relevant
to
glucose
metabolism
was
analysed
by
Western
blot
.

GRE
contained
higher
levels
of
all
compounds
,
except
the
enolic
phenylpyruvic
acid-2-O-glucoside
and
luteolin-7-O-glucoside
.

Both
rooibos
extracts
increased
glucose
uptake
,
mitochondrial
activity
and
ATP
production
.

Compared
to
FRE
,
GRE
was
more
effective
at
increasing
glucose
uptake
and
ATP
production
.

At
a
mechanistic
level
both
extracts
down-regulated
PKC
θ
activation
,
which
is
associated
with
palmitate-induced
insulin
resistance
.

Furthermore
,
the
extracts
increased
activation
of
key
regulatory
proteins
(
AKT
and
AMPK
)
involved
in
insulin-dependent
and
non-insulin
regulated
signalling
pathways
.

Protein
levels
of
the
glucose
transporter
(
GLUT4
)
involved
in
glucose
transport
via
these
two
pathways
were
also
increased
.

This
in
vitro
study
therefore
confirms
that
rooibos
can
ameliorate
palmitate-induced
insulin
resistance
in
C2C12
skeletal
muscle
cells
.

Inhibition
of
PKC
θ
activation
and
increased
activation
of
AMPK
and
AKT
offer
a
plausible
mechanistic
explanation
for
this
ameliorative
effect
.
5'-RACE
was
performed
on
rat
brain
calpastatin
mRNA
and
two
new
translation
initiation
ATG's
were
found
.

The
first
one
is
upstream
of
the
previously
designed
initiation
translation
site
localized
in
the
rat
calpastatin
L-domain
.

The
deduced
protein
sequence
of
this
region
is
highly
homologous
to
the
XL-domain
of
calpastatin
type
I
in
other
species
.

The
other
ATG
has
not
previously
been
reported
and
is
localized
in
exon
8
,
thus
originating
a
calpastatin
isoform
constituted
only
by
four
repetitive
inhibitory
units
without
the
XL-L-domains
.

Transcripts
from
the
rat
brain
calpastatin
gene
are
also
subjected
to
multiple
splicing
events
involving
exons
4
,
6
,
8
in
different
combinations
.

A
series
of
recombinant
calpastatin
forms
was
produced
that
differed
in
the
exons
present
in
the
L-domain
,
and
all
the
variants
showed
comparable
inhibitory
efficiency
against
calpain
.

It
was
concluded
that
the
presence
of
the
XL-domain
in
these
isoforms
is
not
relevant
for
the
formation
of
the
calpain
/
calpastatin
complex
in
the
absence
of
calcium
,
that
is
the
interaction
of
calpastatin
with
inactive
calpain
.

Using
exon-specific
antisera
,
specific
calpastatin
protein
isoforms
containing
the
XL-domain
have
been
detected
in
rat
brain
homogenates
.
It
is
well
known
that
the
sex
difference
in
body
growth
at
puberty
is
modulated
by
a
complex
interplay
between
sex
steroids
and
somatotropic
axis;
however
,
the
exact
role
played
by
sex
steroids
remains
a
matter
of
controversy
.

The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
assess
the
mechanisms
by
which
sex
steroids
regulate
body
growth
during
pubertal
development
.

Flutamide
,
a
non-steroid-blocking
androgen
receptor
,
was
subcutaneously
administered
to
30-d-old
male
Wistar
rats
for
4
wk
.

The
blockade
of
the
androgen
receptor
led
to
a
marked
elevation
in
serum
testosterone
and
an
increment
in
serum
estradiol
.

Flutamide
administration
decreased
body
weight
gain
,
serum
IGF-I
levels
,
hepatic
IGF-I
mRNA
,
and
GH
receptor
mRNA
content
.

There
were
no
significant
changes
in
serum
GH
concentration
,
pituitary
GH
reserve
,
and
pituitary
GH
mRNA
content
.

Flutamide
lowered
hypothalamic
somatostatin
mRNA
content
and
augmented
hypothalamic
immunoreactive
somatostatin
stores
,
but
did
not
alter
hypothalamic
immunoreactive
GH-releasing
factor
stores
.

Our
findings
indicate
that
during
pubertal
development
of
the
male
rat
,
the
imbalance
between
androgen
and
estrogen
actions
determines
an
abnormal
somatic
growth
,
which
is
at
least
partly
exerted
through
the
peripheral
or
hepatic
modification
of
the
somatotropic
axis
that
occurs
under
the
high
or
exclusive
action
of
estrogens
.

Potential
implication
of
coincident
sex-specific
regulated
mode
of
pulsatile
GH
secretion
cannot
be
excluded
from
this
random
serum
GH
sample
study
.

OATP1B3
is
also
expressed
in

Flavonoids
such
as
green
tea
catechins
and
quercetin
glycosides
have
been
shown
to
modulate
the
function
of
some
OATPs
.

In
the
present
study
,
the
extent
to
which
six
substituted
quercetin
derivatives
(
1-6
)
affected
the
function
of
OATP1B1
and
OATP1B3
was
investigated
.

Uptake
of

radiolabeled
model
substrates
estradiol
17β-glucuronide

estrone
3-sulfate
,
and
dehydroepiandrosterone

(
DHEAS
)
was
determined
in
the
absence
and
presence
of
compounds
1-6
using
Chinese
hamster
ovary
(
CHO
)
cells
stably
expressing
either
OATP1B1
or
OATP1B3
.

Several
of
compounds
1-6
inhibited
OATP-mediated
uptake
of
all
three
model
substrates
,
suggesting
that
they
could
also
be
potential
substrates
.

Compound
6
stimulated
OATP1B3-mediated
estradiol
17β-glucuronide
uptake
by
increasing
the
apparent
affinity
of
OATP1B3
for
its
substrate
.

Cytotoxicity
assays
demonstrated
that
epigallocatechin
3-O-gallate
(
EGCG
)
and
most
of
compounds
1-6
killed
preferentially
OATP-expressing
CHO
cells
.

EGCG
,
1
,
and
3
were
the
most
potent
cytotoxic
compounds
,
with
EGCG
and
3
selectively
killing
OATP1B3-expressing
cells
.

Given
that
OATP1B3
is
expressed
in
several
cancers
,
EGCG
and
some
of
the
quercetin
derivatives
studied
might
be
promising
lead
compounds
for
the
development
of
novel
anticancer
drugs

compounds

repressed

for

our
findings

might
provide
information

developing

The
effects

minaprine
on
cycloheximide-induced

were
investigated
in

Minaprine
significantly
improved
cycloheximide-induced
amnesia
.

This
effect
was
inhibited
by
scopolamine
,
but
was
potentiated
by
physostigmine
.

The
anti-amnesic
effect
of
minaprine
on
the
cycloheximide-induced
memory
impairment
was
also
antagonized
by
a
serotonin
(
5-HT
)
releaser
,
p-chloroamphetamine
,
and
by
a
5-HT
precursor
,
5-hydroxytryptophan
,

a
5-HT1A-selective

was

effect
of
minaprine
on
cycloheximide-induced
amnesia
was
potentiated
by
a
selective

These
results
suggest
that
the
beneficial
effect
of
minaprine
on
cycloheximide-induced

may
be
related
not
only
to
cholinergic

also
serotonergic

Osteoporosis

It

a
complex
disorder

the

environmental
factors

for
low

an
effect

Bone
mineral
density
(
BMD
)
measurements
of
the
hip
,
the
spine
and
whole
body
as
well
as
different
hip
geometry
parameters
were
available
for
a
total
of
1404
Danish
men
from
two
age
groups
(
[
20-29
years
]
:
n
=
804;
[
60-74
years
]
:
n
=
600
)
.

Using
linear
regression
analysis
adjusted
for
age
,
height
and
weight
,
we
found
significant
associations
between
both
rs2306029
and
rs6485702
and
BMD
at
all
sites
except
the
lumbar
spine
.

The
most
significant
association
was
found
with
whole
body
BMD
(
p
=
4
.
7×10
(
-5
)
)
.

In
addition
,
we
found
these
two
polymorphisms
to
be
associated
with
different
geometry
parameters
especially
of
the
femoral
shaft
.

Analysis
of
the
two
associated
SNPs
in
the
separate
age
groups
demonstrated
that
most
associations
are
only
present
in
the
youngest
group
of
Danish
men
.

In
the
group
of
elderly
men
,
one
Bonferroni
corrected
association
between
whole
body
BMD
and
rs6485702
was
found
to
be
significant
.

Subsequently
,
all
polymorphisms
were
included
in
haplotype
analyses
using
the
PLINK
software
(
v1
.
07
)
.

After
adjusting
for
age
,
height
and
weight
,
two
out
of
five
common
haplotypes
(
MAF≥0
.
01
)
were
found
to
be
of
particular
interest
in
the
regulation
of
hip
and
whole
body
BMD
(
AGCG
,
AACA
)
.

Additional
analysis
suggested
that
these
latter
associations
are
driven
by
the
association
of
rs6485702
.

We
suggest
,
based
on
these
results
and
the
localisation
of
the
variant
in
the
third
β-propeller
domain
of
LRP4
,
that
the
variant
has
possibly
a
functional
effect
.

Hereby
,
we
conclude
that
common
variation
in
the
LRP4
gene
determines
hip
and
whole
body
BMD
and
thus
confirm
previous
results
from
different
GWAs
.

In
addition
,
our
data
proves
an
additional
role
for
LRP4
in
regulating
hip
structure
.

Finally
,
interaction
analysis
for
LRP4
with
SOST
and
LRP5
showed
interaction
with
LRP5
for
femoral
shaft
geometry
.

Schizophrenia
is
a
highly
complex
disorder
characterized
by
a
diversity
of
symptoms
,
psychotic
and
nonpsychotic
,
that
most
likely
arise
from
heterogeneous
neuroanatomical
and
neurochemical
malfunctions
.

As
with
all
antipsychotic
agents
,
ziprasidone
targets
the
key
hypothetical
neurochemical
disturbance
in
psychosis-excessive
dopamine
neurotransmission
at
dopamine
D2
receptors
in
the
mesolimbic
pathway
of
the
brain-presumably
responsible
for
the
positive
symptoms
of
schizophrenia
.

Like
other
atypical
antipsychotic
agents
,
ziprasidone
is
a
serotonin-2A
(
5-HT2A
)
/
dopamine
D2
antagonist;
however
,
its
in
vitro
5-HT2A
/
D2
receptor
affinity
ratio
is
higher
than
that
of
the
other
first-line
atypical
antipsychotic
agents
(
namely
,
risperidone
,
olanzapine
,
quetiapine
,
and
aripiprazole
)
.

Ziprasidone
also
exhibits
potent
interaction
with
5-HT2C
,
5-HT1D
,
and
5-HT1A
receptors
in
human
brain
tissue
,
characteristics
that
predict
heightened
negative
symptom
relief
,
enhanced
modulation
of
mood
,
cognitive
improvement
,
and
reduced
motor
dysfunction
.

Ziprasidone
has
moderate
affinity
for
serotonin
and
norepinephrine
reuptake
sites
,
predicting
antidepressant
/
anxiolytic
activity
.

On
the
other
hand
,
ziprasidone's
low
affinity
for
alpha1-adrenoceptors
,
as
well
as
histamine
H1
and
muscarinic
M1
receptors
,
suggests
that
patients
should
experience
relatively
little
orthostatic
hypotension
,
sedation
,
cognitive
disturbance
,
weight
gain
,
or
dysregulation
of
prolactin
levels
.

Efficacy
and
tolerability
data
from
trials
to
date
indicate
that
ziprasidone's
clinical
activity
is
consistent
with
its
receptor
profile
.
Omega-3
polyunsaturated
fatty
acids
(
PUFAs
)
are
known
to
alleviate
joint
stiffness
and
pain
in
rheumatoid
arthritis
patients
.

However
,
the
mechanisms
by
which
omega-3s
exert
their
beneficial
effects
has
not
been
fully
explored
.

Herein
we
discuss
a
novel
class
of
bioactive
lipid
mediators
,
which
are
enzymatically
biosynthesized
in
vivo
from
omega-3
eicosapentaenoic
acid
(
EPA
)
and
docosahexaenoic
acid
(
DHA
)
,
termed
resolvins
.

These
lipid
mediators
exert
anti-inflammatory
and
pro-resolving
properties
and
are
log-orders
more
potent
than
their
precursors
.

We
also
highlight
that
formation
of
pro-resolving
mediators
can
be
enhanced
by
widely
used
anti-inflammatory
and
cardioprotective
drugs
(
aspirin
and
statins
)
via
the
modification
of
cyclooxygenase-2
enzymatic
activity
.

These
bioactive
pro-resolving
lipid
mediators
provide
further
rationale
for
the
beneficial
effects
of
dietary
supplementation
with
fish
oils
,
and
offer
new
avenues
for
developing
therapeutics
for
inflammatory
conditions
such
as
rheumatoid
arthritis
.

Arginine
vasopressin
(
AVP
)
is
a
neuropeptide
hormone
that
plays
an
important
role
in
circulatory
and
sodium
homeostasis
,
and
regulating
serum
osmolality
.

Several
clinical
conditions
have
been
associated
with
inappropriately
elevated
levels
of
AVP
including
heart
failure
,
cirrhosis
of
the
liver
and
the
syndrome
of
inappropriate
secretion
of
antidiuretic
hormone
.

Three
receptor
subtypes
that
mediate
the
actions
of
AVP
have
been
identified
(
V
(
1A
)
,
V
(
2
)
and
V
(
1B
)
)
.

Activation
of
V
(
1A
)
receptors
located
in
vascular
smooth
muscle
cells
and
the
myocardium
results
in
vasoconstriction
and
increased
afterload
and
hypertrophy
.

The
V
(
2
)
receptors
located
primarily
in
the
collecting
tubules
mediate
free
water
absorption
.

The
V
(
1B
)
receptors
are
located
in
the
anterior
pituitary
and
mediate
adrenocorticotropin
hormone
release
.

The
cardiovascular
and
renal
effects
of
AVP
are
mediated
primarily
by
V
(
1A
)
and
V
(
2
)
receptors
.

Antagonism
of
V
(
1A
)
receptors
results
in
vasodilatation
and
antagonism
of
V
(
2
)
receptors
resulting
in
aquaresis
,
an
electrolyte-sparing
water
excretion
.

Several
non-peptide
AVP
antagonists
(
vasopressin
receptor
antagonists
[
VRAs
]
)
also
termed
'vaptans'
have
been
developed
and
are
vigorously
being
studied
primarily
for
treating
conditions
characterised
by
hyponatraemia
and
fluid
overload
.

Conivaptan
is
a
combined
V
(
1A
)
/
V
(
2
)
-receptor
antagonist
that
induces
diuresis
as
well
as
haemodynamic
improvement
.

It
has
been
shown
in
clinical
trials
to
correct
euvolaemic
and
hypervolaemic
hyponatraemia
,
and
has
been
approved
by
the
US
FDA
for
the
treatment
of
euvolaemic
hyponatraemia
as
an
intravenous
infusion
.

Tolvaptan
,
a
selective
V
(
2
)
-receptor
antagonist
,
has
undergone
extensive
clinical
studies
in
the
treatment
of
hyponatraemia
and
heart
failure
.

It
has
been
shown
to
effectively
decrease
fluid
in
volume
overloaded
patients
with
heart
failure
and
to
correct
hyponatraemia
.

A
large
outcome
study
(
n
=
4133
patients
)
will
define
its
role
in
the
management
of
heart
failure
.

Lixivaptan
and
satavaptan
(
SR-121463
)
are
other
selective
V
(
2
)
-receptor
antagonists
being
evaluated
for
the
treatment
of
hyponatraemia
.

In
addition
,
a
potential
role
for
the
vaptans
in
attenuating
polyuria
in
nephrogenic
diabetes
insipidus
and
cyst
development
in
polycystic
kidney
disease
is
being
explored
.

Ongoing
clinical
trials
should
further
define
the
scope
of
the
potential
therapeutic
role
of
VRAs
.
AIM
:
To
study
effects
of
acetazolamide
on
aquaporin-1
(
AQP
(
1
)
)
protein
expression
and
angiogenesis
.

METHODS
:
Establishing
Lewis-lung-carcinoma
model
,
the
localization
of
AQP
(
1
)
in
tumor
tissues
was
investigated
by
immunohistochemical
methods;
The
biological
activity
of
acetazolamide
was
detected
by
endothelial
cells
proliferation
test
(
MTT
)
assay
and
chorioallantoic
membrane
(
CAM
)
vascular
inhibition
test
.

RESULTS
:
Immunohistochemical
localization
of
AQP
(
1
)
in
mice
tumor
was
labeled
in
capillaries
,
post
capillary
venules
endothelial
cells
.

After
being
treated
with
acetazolamide
,
the
number
of
capillaries
and
post
capillary
venules
was
significantly
decreased
in
tumor
tissue
.

Acetazolamide
showed
significant
inhibitory
effect
on
angiogenesis
in
CAM
and
endothelial
cell
proliferation
.

CONCLUSION
:
Acetazolamide
might
be
identified
and
developed
as
one
of
potential
lead
compounds
for
a
new
therapeutic
intervention
in
inhibiting
cancer
angiogenesis
.
A

Recurrent

In
mice
,
in
utero
exposure
to
2
,
3
,
7
,
8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-
dioxin
(
TCDD
)
reduces
the
number
of
dorsolateral
prostatic
buds
resulting
in
a
smaller
dorsolateral
prostate
and
prevents
formation
of
ventral
buds
culminating
in
ventral
prostate
agenesis
.

The
genes
and
signaling
pathways
affected
by
TCDD
that
are
responsible
for
disrupting
prostate
development
are
largely
unknown
.

Here
we
show
that
treatment
of
urogenital
sinus
(
UGS
)
organ
cultures
with
known
inhibitors
of
canonical
Wnt
signaling
also
inhibits
prostatic
bud
formation
.

In
support
of
the
hypothesis
that
TCDD
decreases
canonical
Wnt
signaling
,
we
identify
inhibitory
effects
of
TCDD
on
multiple
components
of
the
canonical
Wnt
signaling
pathway
in
the
UGS
that
temporally
coincide
with
the
inhibitory
effect
of
TCDD
on
prostatic
bud
formation
:
(
1
)
expression
of
R-spondins
(
Rspo2
and
Rspo3
)
that
promote
canonical
Wnt
signaling
is
reduced;
(
2
)
expression
of
Lef1
,
Tcf1
,
and
Wif1
,
established
canonical
Wnt
target
genes
,
is
decreased;
(
3
)
expression
of
Lgr5
,
a
RSPO
receptor
that
activates
canonical
Wnt
signaling
,
is
reduced;
and
(
4
)
expression
of
Dickkopfs
(
Dkks
)
,
inhibitors
of
canonical
Wnt
signaling
,
is
not
increased
by
TCDD
.

Thus
,
the
TCDD-induced
reduction
in
canonical
Wnt
signaling
is
associated
with
a
decrease
in
activators
(
Rspo2
and
Rspo3
)
rather
than
an
increase
in
inhibitors
(
Dkk1
and
Dkk2
)
of
the
pathway
.

This
study
focuses
on
determining
whether
treatment
of
TCDD-exposed
UGS
organ
cultures
with
RSPO2
and
/
or
RSPO3
is
capable
of
rescuing
the
inhibitory
effects
of
TCDD
on
canonical
Wnt
signaling
and
prostatic
bud
formation
.

We
discovered
that
each
RSPO
alone
or
in
combination
partially
rescues
TCDD
inhibition
of
both
canonical
Wnt
signaling
and
prostatic
bud
formation
.

Although
anti-Parkinson's

activity
of
puerarin
was
reported
in
both
of
in

model
,
detailed
mechanisms
are

In

via
modulating
GDNF

Pseudohypoaldosteronism
type
1
(
PHA1
)
is
characterized
by
neonatal
salt
wasting
resistant
to
mineralocorticoids
.

There
are
2
forms
of
PHA1
:
the
autosomal
recessive
form
with
symptoms
persisting
into
adulthood
,
caused
by
mutations
in
the
amiloride-sensitive
luminal
sodium
channel
,
and
the
autosomal
dominant
or
sporadic
form
,
which
shows
milder
symptoms
that
remit
with
age
.

Mutations
in
the
gene
encoding
the
human
mineralocorticoid
receptor
(
hMR
)
are
,
at
least
in
some
patients
,
responsible
for
the
latter
form
of
PHA1
.

We
here
report
the
results
of
a
genetic
study
in
a
sporadic
case
and
in
5
affected
patients
from
2
families
with
autosomal
dominant
PHA1
.

In
the
sporadic
case
we
identified
a
new
frameshift
mutation
,
Ins2871C
,
in
exon
9
of
the
hMR
gene
.

Family
members
were
asymptomatic
and
had
no
mutation
.

This
mutation
is
the
first
described
in
exon
9
and
impairs
the
last
27
amino
acids
of
the
hormone-binding
domain
.

In
2
kindreds
with
autosomal
dominant
PHA1
we
found
no
mutation
of
the
hMR
gene
.

Our
results
confirm
the
hypothesis
that
autosomal
dominant
or
sporadic
PHA1
is
a
genetically
heterogeneous
disease
involving
other
,
as
yet
unidentified
,
genes
.

Smoking

Protein

.

Overexpression
of
brain-specific
regulatory
subunit
PPP2R2
in
neuron
cells
is
implicated
in
pathogenesis
.

The
alternative
splicing
of
PPP2R2B
encodes
two
isoforms
.

They
are
subunit
of
cytoplasmic
specific
Bβ1
and
mitochondria-targeted
Bβ2
.

The
two
constructs
were

and

We
have
reported
that

are
sensitive

To
learn
how
PPP2R2B
overexpression
responds
to

,
cells
were
incubated
in
Hank's

solution
of

nutrient
.

Cell
death
was
induced
in
Bβ1
clones
after
6
h

,
but
not
in

.

The
pharmacological

,
Bafilomycin

,
rescued
the
cell

while
suppressing
autophagy
.

On
the

hand
,
to
assess
how

,
the
cells
were
treated
with

.

In
contrast
with

,
the
apoptotic

death
appeared
in
Bβ2
after
48
h

.

The

following

as
evidenced
by

The

,
salvaged
the

The

lines
with
ectopically

encoding

of

exhibit
distinct

The
induced
autophagic

is
related
to
mitochondrial

generation
.

Disturbance
of
autophagy
alleviates

The
results

Mosquitoes
are
unique
in
having
evolved
two
alanine
glyoxylate
aminotransferases
(
AGTs
)
.

One
is
3-hydroxykynurenine
transaminase
(
HKT
)
,
which
is
primarily
responsible
for
catalyzing
the
transamination
of
3-hydroxykynurenine
(
3-HK
)
to
xanthurenic
acid
(
XA
)
.

Interestingly
,
XA
is
used
by
malaria
parasites
as
a
chemical
trigger
for
their
development
within
the
mosquito
.

This
3-HK
to
XA
conversion
is
considered
the
major
mechanism
mosquitoes
use
to
detoxify
the
chemically
reactive
and
potentially
toxic
3-HK
.

The
other
AGT
is
a
typical
dipteran
insect
AGT
and
is
specific
for
converting
glyoxylic
acid
to
glycine
.

Here
we
report
the
1
.
75A
high-resolution
three-dimensional
crystal
structure
of
AGT
from
the
mosquito
Aedes
aegypti
(
AeAGT
)
and
structures
of
its
complexes
with
reactants
glyoxylic
acid
and
alanine
at
1
.
75
and
2
.
1A
resolution
,
respectively
.

This
is
the
first
time
that
the
three-dimensional
crystal
structures
of
an
AGT
with
its
amino
acceptor
,
glyoxylic
acid
,
and
amino
donor
,
alanine
,
have
been
determined
.

The
protein
is
dimeric
and
adopts
the
type
I-fold
of
pyridoxal
5-phosphate
(
PLP
)
-dependent
aminotransferases
.

The
PLP
co-factor
is
covalently
bound
to
the
active
site
in
the
crystal
structure
,
and
its
binding
site
is
similar
to
those
of
other
AGTs
.

The
comparison
of
the
AeAGT-glyoxylic
acid
structure
with
other
AGT
structures
revealed
that
these
glyoxylic
acid
binding
residues
are
conserved
in
most
AGTs
.

Comparison
of
the
AeAGT-alanine
structure
with
that
of
the
Anopheles
HKT-inhibitor
complex
suggests
that
a
Ser-Asn-Phe
motif
in
the
latter
may
be
responsible
for
the
substrate
specificity
of
HKT
enzymes
for
3-HK
.

The
aim
of
this

was
to
test

BLG
)
in
Maillard

(
MR
)
induced
by
high-intensity
ultrasound
in
aqueous

under
neutral
conditions
at
10-15
°C
,
which
is
not
favourable
for
the

.

BLG
was
sonicated
in
the
presence
of
glucose
,
galactose
,
lactose
,
fructose
,
ribose
and
arabinose
.

Formation
of
Maillard
reaction
products
(
MRPs
)
was
monitored
by
mass
spectrometry
,
spectrophotometry
and
fluorimetry
.

Ultrasound
treatment
resulted
in
formation
of
MRPs
with
all
tested
carbohydrates
.

Ribose
induced
the
highest
degree
of
modification
resulting
in
76%
of
BLG
modified
and
an
average
of
three
anhydroribose
units
attached
.

Circular

spectra
analyses
indicated
only
minor
alterations

Tamibarotene
,
binds
to
retinoic

alpha
(
RARalpha

.

We
studied
the
tumor
cell
suppressive
effects
of
Am-80
,
with
respect
to
cytotoxicity
and
growth
inhibition
using
eight
myeloid
and
lymphoid
malignant
cells
in
culture
(

,
K-562
,
Kasumi-1
,

,

,
and

)
.

The
effects
of
Am-80
were
examined
during
9
days
of
incubation
with
10

M
of
Am-80
in

medium
,
which
was
changed
every
3
days
.

HL-60
were
the
only
cells
sensitive
to
Am-80-induced
cytotoxicity;
the
latter
reached
more
than
95%
after
9
days
of
incubation
,
and
death
was
primarily
through
apoptosis
.

The
total
mass
of
RARalpha
in
HL-60
was
significantly
greater
(
p<0
.
006
)
than
in
ATRA-resistant
HL-60
(
HL-60R
)
as
well
as
all
of
other
cells
tested
.

However
,
in
all
cells
excluding
HL-60
,
Am-80
induced
time-
and
dose-dependent
cell
growth
inhibition
without
noticeable
cytotoxicity
.

TGF-beta2
was
released
into
the
media
containing
cells
incubated
with
Am-80
for
3
days
.

A
dose-dependent
increment
of
phosphorylation
of
Smad-2
was
also
detected
.

The
relative
amount
of
secreted
TGF-beta2
correlated
with
the
growth
inhibition
rates
in
all
cells
tested
excluding
HL-60
,
and
with
the
total
mass
of
RARalpha
in
the
cells
(
p
=
0
.

)
.

Our
results
indicate
that
Am-80-induced
cell-type
non-specific
growth
inhibition
is
mediated
by
TGF-beta2
,
where
the
total
mass
of
RARalpha
could
be
an
important
regulatory
factor
in
hematologic
malignant
cells
.
The
objective
of
this
study
was
to
clarify
the
mechanism
underlying
hepatic

observed
by

rat
livers
in

,
respectively
.

The
time
course
of
dioscin
uptake
by
rat
liver
slices
was
temperature-dependent
.

Uptake
of
dioscin
by
rat
liver
slices
and
isolated
rat
hepatocytes
was
inhibited
significantly
by
Oatp
modulators
,
such
as
ibuprofen
(
Oatp1a1

)
,
digoxin
(
Oatp1a4
substrate
)
,
and
glycyrrhizic
acid
(
Oatp1b2
inhibitor
)
,
but
not
by
TEA
or
p-aminohippurate
.

Uptake
of
dioscin
in
rat
hepatocytes
and
OATP1B3-human
embryonic
kidney
(
HEK
)
293
cells
indicated
a
saturable
process
with
a

and

inhibited
transport

However
,
transcellular
transport
of

or
OATP1B1
/
multidrug
resistance-associated
protein
2-Madin-Darby

kidney
strain

cells
was
not
observed
.

These
results
indicate
that
hepatic
uptake
of
dioscin
is
involved
in
OATP1B3
in
humans
,
and
multiple
Oatps
might
participate
in
this
process
in
rats

The
pro-apoptotic
BCL-2
family
member
BOK
is
widely
expressed
and
resembles
the
multi-BH
domain
proteins
BAX
and
BAK
based
on
its
amino
acid
sequence
.

The
genomic
region
encoding
BOK
was
reported
to
be
frequently
deleted
in
human
cancer
and
it
has
therefore
been
hypothesized
that
BOK
functions
as
a
tumor
suppressor
.

However
,
little
is
known
about
the
molecular
functions
of
BOK
.

We
show
that
enforced
expression
of
BOK
activates
the
intrinsic
(
mitochondrial
)
apoptotic
pathway
in
BAX
/
BAK-proficient
cells
but
fails
to
kill
cells
lacking
both
BAX
and
BAK
or
sensitize
them
to
cytotoxic
insults
.

Interestingly
,
major
portions
of
endogenous
BOK
are
localized
to
and
partially
inserted
into
the
membranes
of
the
Golgi
apparatus
as
well
as
the
endoplasmic
reticulum
(
ER
)
and
associated
membranes
.

The
C-terminal
transmembrane
domain
of
BOK
thereby
constitutes
a
'tail-anchor'
specific
for
targeting
to
the
Golgi
and
ER
.

Overexpression
of
full-length
BOK
causes
early
fragmentation
of
ER
and
Golgi
compartments
.

A
role
for
BOK
on
the
Golgi
apparatus
and
the
ER
is
supported
by
an
abnormal
response
of
Bok-deficient
cells
to
the
Golgi
/
ER
stressor
brefeldin
A
.

Based
on
these
results
,
we
propose
that
major
functions
of
BOK
are
exerted
at
the
Golgi
and
ER
membranes
and
that
BOK
induces
apoptosis
in
a
manner
dependent
on
BAX
and
BAK
.

We
studied
the
effects
of
the
new
rapid
acting
human
insulin
analogue
(
Lys

,
Pro

insulin
)
,
insulin
Lispro
(

)
on
metabolic
control
and
insulin
receptor
binding
in
type
II
diabetes
mellitus
.

We
investigated
2
patients
:
Patient
1
was
obese
,
clearly
insulin-resistant
,
injected
high
doses
of
insulin
(
3-4
IU
/
kg
body
weight
)
,
and
had
insufficient
diabetes
control
.

Patient
2
was
of
normal
body
weight
,
injected
normal
insulin
doses
(
0
.
7-0
.
8
IU
/
kg
body
weight
)
,
and
had
good
diabetes
control
.

Patient
1
showed
a
considerable
improvement
of
insulin
binding
after
receiving
Lispro
(
26
,
700
vs
.

5
,
600
receptors
/
monocyte;
Kd
560
vs
.

,

pM
)
.

Concommitantly
,
a
decrease
of
serum
glucose
and
insulin
dose
was
observed
,
reflecting
a
higher
insulin
sensitivity
during
Lispro
treatment
.

In
patient
2
injected
with
Lispro
the
time
course
of
serum
glucose
,
serum
insulin
,
and
insulin
binding
after
an
oral
meal
was
comparable
to
values
obtained
in
healthy
controls
.

We
conclude
that
the
quick
and
pulsatile
pharmacokinetic
profile
of
the
insulin
analogue
Lispro
may
improve
glycemia
,
insulin
receptor
binding
,
and
insulin
resistance
in
type
II
diabetes
.
The
major
goal
in
the
treatment
of
type
2
diabetes
mellitus
is
to
control
the
hyperglycaemia
characteristic
of
the
disease
.

However
,
treatment
with
common
therapies
such
as
insulin
or
insulinotrophic
sulphonylureas
(
SU
)
,
while
effective
in
reducing
hyperglycaemia
,
may
impose
a
greater
risk
of
hypoglycaemia
,
as
neither
therapy
is
self-regulated
by
ambient
blood
glucose
concentrations
.

Hypoglycaemia
has
been
associated
with
adverse
physical
and
psychological
outcomes
and
may
contribute
to
negative
cardiovascular
events;
hence
minimization
of
hypoglycaemia
risk
is
clinically
advantageous
.

Stimulation
of
insulin
secretion
from
pancreatic
β-cells
by
glucagon-like
peptide
1
receptor
(
GLP-1R
)
agonists
is
known
to
be
glucose-dependent
.

GLP-1R
agonists
potentiate
glucose-stimulated
insulin
secretion
and
have
little
or
no
activity
on
insulin
secretion
in
the
absence
of
elevated
blood
glucose
concentrations
.

This
'glucose-regulated'
activity
of
GLP-1R
agonists
makes
them
useful
and
potentially
safer
therapeutics
for
overall
glucose
control
compared
to
non-regulated
therapies;
hyperglycaemia
can
be
reduced
with
minimal
hypoglycaemia
.

While
the
inherent
mechanism
of
action
of
GLP-1R
agonists
mediates
their
glucose
dependence
,
studies
in
rats
suggest
that
SUs
may
uncouple
this
dependence
.

This
hypothesis
is
supported
by
clinical
studies
showing
that
the
majority
of
events
of
hypoglycaemia
in
patients
treated
with
GLP-1R
agonists
occur
in
patients
treated
with
a
concomitant
SU
.

This
review
aims
to
discuss
the
current
understanding
of
the
mechanisms
by
which
GLP-1R
signalling
promotes
insulin
secretion
from
pancreatic
β-cells
via
a
glucose-dependent
process
.
An
11
beta
hydroxysteroid
dehydrogenase
(
11
beta
HSD
)
activity
has
been
localized
in
the
rat
kidney
by
a
histochemical
technique
which
links
steroid
metabolism
with
the
production
of
a
color
reaction
.

Oxidation
of
11
beta-hydroxyandrostenedione
was
observed
in
cortical
distal
convoluted
tubules
and
in
medullary
collecting
ducts
.

Carbenoxolone
abolished
staining
,
no
reaction
was
obtained
with
androstenedione
hydroxylated
at
the
17
or
19
position
,
and
oxidation
of
11
beta-hydroxyandrostenedione
was
nicotinamide-adenine
dinucleotide
(
NAD
)
dependent
.

These
results
demonstrate
the
presence
of
a
dehydrogenase
activity
separate
from
the
nicotinamide-adenine
dinucleotide
phosphate
(
NADP
)
-dependent
11
beta
hydroxysteroid
dehydrogenase
recently
purified
and
cloned
from
rat
liver
.

We
have
named
this
activity
11
beta
HSD2
to
distinguish
it
from
the
NADP-dependent
11
beta
HSD
.

Histological
studies
showed
that
11
beta
HSD2
activity
does
not
correlate
with
the
immunocytochemical
localization
of
the
previously
defined
11
beta
HSD
enzyme
,
but
rather
the
11
beta
HSD2
activity
is
localized
in
the
distal

of
the
rat
kidney
.

In
this
respect
11
beta
HSD2
colocalizes
with
the
mineralocorticoid
receptor
.

No
reaction
product
was
obtained
using
cortisol
or
corticosterone
as
substrate
with
either
NAD
or
NADP
as
cofactor
.

Furthermore
incubation
of
tissue
sections
with
11
beta
androstenedione
in
the
presence
of
deoxycorticosterone
completely
inhibited
cytochemical
staining
.

We
interpret
these
results
as
evidence
of
20
reductase
activity
which
uses
the
reduced
cofactor
at
the
expense
of
the
color
reaction
.

These
results
support
the
crucial
role
played
by
an
11
beta
hydroxysteroid
dehydrogenase
in
the
local
protection
of
type
I
receptors
in
mineralocorticoid
selective
tissues
.
A
combined
pharmacological
and
genetic
approach
was
undertaken
to
investigate
the
contribution
of
endogenous
dopamine
to
the
motor
actions
of
nociceptin
/
orphanin
FQ
(
N
/
OFQ
)
receptor
(
NOP
receptor
)
ligands
.

Motor
activity
was
evaluated
by
a
battery
of
behavioural
tests
in
mice
.

The
involvement
of
the
various
DA
receptor
subtypes
in
the
motor
effects
of
N
/
OFQ
and
NOP
receptor
antagonists
was
evaluated
pharmacologically
,
using
D1
/
D5
(
SCH23390
)
,
D2
/
D3
(
raclopride
,
amisulpride
)
and
D3
(
S33084
)
receptor
antagonists
,
and
by
using
D2
receptor
knockout
mice
.

Low
doses
of
N
/
OFQ
and
NOP
receptor
antagonists
promoted
movement
whereas
higher
doses
inhibited
it
.

Motor
facilitation
was
selectively
prevented
by
raclopride
while
motor
inhibition
was
prevented
by
amisulpride
.

Amisulpride
also
attenuated
the
hypolocomotion
induced
by
the
D2
/
D3
receptor
agonist
pramipexole
and
dopamine
precursor
L-3
,
4-dihydroxyphenylalanine
,
whereas
raclopride
(
and
S33084
)
worsened
it
.

To
dissect
out
the
contribution
of
pre-
and
postsynaptic
D2
receptors
,
mice
lacking
the
D2
receptor
(
D2R
(
-
/
-
)
)
or
its
long
isoform
(
D2L
(
-
/
-
)
)
were
used
.

Motor
facilitation
induced
by
N
/
OFQ
and
NOP
receptor
antagonists
was
lost
in
D2R
(
-
/
-
)
and
D2L
(
-
/
-
)
mice
whereas
motor
inhibition
induced
by
NOP
receptor
antagonists
(
and
pramipexole
)
was
lost
in
D2R
(
-
/
-
)
but
preserved
in
D2L
(
-
/
-
)
mice
.

N
/
OFQ-induced
hypolocomotion
was
observed
in
both
genotypes
.

We
demonstrate
that
motor
actions
of
NOP
receptor
ligands
rely
on
the
modulation
of
endogenous
dopamine
.

Motor
facilitation
induced
by
NOP
receptor
antagonists
as
well
as
low
dose
N
/
OFQ
is
mediated
through
D2L
postsynaptic
receptors
whereas
motor
inhibition
observed
with
higher
doses
of
N
/
OFQ
occurs
by
direct
inhibition
of
mesencephalic
DA
neurons
.

Motor
inhibition
seen
with
high
doses
of
NOP
receptor
antagonists
appears
to
be
mediated
through
the
D2
presynaptic
autoreceptors
.

These
data
confirm
that
endogenous
N
/
OFQ
is
a
powerful
modulator
of
dopamine
transmission
in
vivo
and
that
the
effects
of
NOP
receptor
antagonists
on
motor
function
reflect
the
blockade
of
this
endogenous
N
/
OFQ
tone
.
While
non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory
drugs
(
NSAIDs
)
are
the
mainstay
of
therapy
for
the
management
of
acute
pain
and
rheumatoid
arthritis
,
toxicity
associated
with
chronic
administration
limits
their
benefit-to-risk
relationship
in
many
patients
.

A
series
of
studies
is
reviewed
that
assesses
the
relationship
between
cytokines
released
at
the
site
of
tissue
injury
and
NSAID
analgesia
,
and
the
in
vivo
selectivity
of
a
selective
cyclooxygenase
(
COX
)
-2
inhibitor
(
celecoxib
)
in
comparison
to
a
dual
COX-1
/
COX-2
inhibitor
(
ketorolac
)
.

Three
replicate
studies
in
the
oral
surgery
model
of
acute
pain
used
submucosal
microdialysis
sample
collection
for
the
measurement
of
prostaglandin
E2
(
PGE2;
a
product
of
both
COX-1
and
COX-2
)
and
thromboxane
B2
(
as
a
biomarker
for
COX-1
activity
)
with
parallel
assessments
of
pain
.

The
time
course
of
PGE2
production
was
consistent
with
early
release
due
to
COX-1
activity
followed
by
increased
production
2-3
hours
after
surgery
,
consistent
with
COX-2
expression
.

Ketorolac
30
mg
at
pain
onset
suppressed
both
pain
and
peripheral
PGE2
levels
.

Ketorolac
1
mg
either
at
the
site
of
injury
or
intramuscularly
also
produced
analgesia
but
without
any
effect
on
peripheral
PGE2
levels
.

Celecoxib
selectively
suppressed
PGE2
but
not
TxB2
at
time
points
consistent
with
COX-2
activity
,
while
producing
analgesia
.

These
studies
demonstrate
the
ability
to
assess
the
time
course
and
selective
effects
of
COX-2
inhibitors
in
vivo
and
suggest
that
suppression
of
COX-2
mediated
PGE2
is
temporally
related
to
NSAID
analgesia
.

The
phytochemical
investigation
of
the
ethylacetate-soluble
fraction
of
Caryopteris
odorata
(
Ham
.

ex
Roxb
.

)
led
to
the
isolation
of
four
new
iridoid
glucosides
(
1-4
)
:
8-O-trans-cinnamoyl
caryoptoside
(
1
)
,
8-O-trans-cinnamoyl
shanzhiside
methylester
(
2
)
,
8-O-trans-cinnamoyl
mussaenoside
(
3
)
and
8-O-cafeoyl
massenoside
(
4
)
.

The
structures
of
these
compounds
were
determined
by
FAB-MS
,
IR
,
1D
and
2D-NMR
spectroscopy
and
by
comparing
with
the
published
data
of
the
closely
related
compounds
.

The
antioxidant
potential
of
the
isolated
iridoids
(
1-4
)
was
evaluated
relative
to
conventionally
used
standards
and
these
molecules
exhibited
good
antioxidant
potential
.

Moreover
,
their
inhibitory
potential
was
also
screened
against
three
enzymes
,
namely
acetyl
cholinesterase
,
butyrylcholinesterase
and
lipoxygenase
.

These
iridoid
glucosides
were
found
to
be
inactive
against
acetyl
and
butyrylcholinesterases
but
active
against
lipoxygenase
.
The
combinations
of
the
endothelin-1
receptor
antagonists
bosentan
or
ambrisentan
with
the
phosphodiesterase
5
inhibitors
sildenafil
or
tadalafil
are
current
standard
therapies
of
advanced
pulmonary
arterial
hypertension
.

However
,
these
drugs
have
a
number
of
drug
interactions
.

Changes
of
bosentan
pharmacokinetics
by
sildenafil
are
attributed
to
reduced
hepatic
uptake
as
a
consequence
of
inhibition
of
organic
anion
transporting
polypeptides
.

We
therefore
tested
in
vitro
the
hypothesis
that
sildenafil
and
tadalafil
reduce
the
enzyme-
and
transporter-inducing
effects
of
bosentan
or
ambrisentan
by
preventing
cellular
access
.

Although
intracellular
concentrations
of
bosentan
and
ambrisentan
(
measured
by
high
pressure
liquid
chromatography
coupled
with
tandem
mass-spectrometry
)
after
four
days
of
incubation
of
LS180
cells
were
lower
when
sildenafil
or
tadalafil
were
present
,
quantification
of
mRNA
expression
in
these
cells
by
real-time
reverse
transcription
polymerase
chain
reaction
revealed
that
bosentan
and
ambrisentan-mediated
induction
was
stable
or
even
increased
in
combination
with
sildenafil
or
tadalafil
.

For
the
drug
transporter
P-glycoprotein
this
was
confirmed
at
the
protein
and
functional
level
with
highly
significant
correlations
between
P-gp
mRNA
,
protein
,
and
function
.

Moreover
,
using
a
reporter
gene
assay
in
LS180
cells
,
our
study
demonstrates
for
the
first
time
that
tadalafil
is
a
potent
,
ambrisentan
a
weak
,
and
sildenafil
no
activator
of
pregnane
X
receptor
.

In
conclusion
,
our
study
demonstrates
that
although
sildenafil
and
tadalafil
indeed
reduce
intracellular
concentrations
of
bosentan
and
ambrisentan
in
LS180
cells
,
they
do
not
mitigate
the
inducing
effects
of
these
endothelin-1
receptor
antagonists
.

There
is
considerable
evidence
that
pregnancy
changes
the
disposition
of
drugs
in
an
enzyme-
and
gestational
stage-specific
manner
.

On
the
basis
of
probe
drug
studies
,
the
activity
of
CYP3A4
and
CYP2D6
increases
and
CYP1A2
decreases
during
human
pregnancy
.

However
,
no
studies
of
CYP2B6
activity
during
human
pregnancy
have
been
conducted
.

In
rodent
models
and
in
HepG2
cells
,
CYP2B
enzymes
have
been
shown
to
be
regulated
by
estradiol
.

Because
estradiol
concentrations
increase
by
∼50-fold
during
human
pregnancy
,
it
was
hypothesized
that
the
increasing
estradiol
concentrations
during
human
pregnancy
would
result
in
induction
of
CYP2B6
activity
.

Hepatocytes
from
three
female
donors
were
treated
with
estradiol
,
and
the
EC
(
50
)
and
E
(
max
)
were
measured
for
CYP2B6
mRNA
and
bupropion
hydroxylation
activity
.

The
measured
values
were
used
to
predict
the
magnitude
of
CYP2B6
induction
during
human
pregnancy
.

At
100
nM
total
estradiol
,
a
concentration
achievable
during
the
third
trimester
of
pregnancy
,
CYP2B6
activity
was
predicted
to
increase
by
1
.
5-3-fold
,
based
on
increased
CYP2B6
activity
and
mRNA
.

When
the
E
(
max
)
and
EC
(
50
)
values
were
compared
with
those
for
carbamazepine
and
rifampin
,
estradiol
was
found
to
be
as
potent
an
inducer
of
CYP2B6
as
rifampin
and
carbamazepine
.

These
data
suggest
that
,
during
human
pregnancy
,
the
increasing
estradiol
concentrations
will
result
in
increased
clearance
of
drugs
that
have
CYP2B6-mediated
clearance
pathways
.

This
could
in
part
explain
the
observed
increase
in
methadone
clearance
during
pregnancy
.
Prostate
cancer
(
PCa
)
is
the
most
commonly
diagnosed
cancer
in
men
.

The
progression
and
invasion
of
PCa
are
normally
mediated
by
the
overexpression
of
chemokine
receptors
(
CKRs
)
and
the
interaction
between
CKRs
and
their
cognate
ligands
.

We
recently
demonstrated
that
venom
extracted
from
Walterinnesia
aegyptia
(
WEV
)
either
alone
or
in
combination
with
silica
nanoparticles
(
WEV
+
NP
)
mediated
the
growth
arrest
and
apoptosis
of
breast
cancer
cells
.

In
the
present
study
,
we
evaluated
the
impact
of
WEV
alone
and
WEV
+
NP
on
the
migration
,
invasion
,
proliferation
and
apoptosis
of
prostate
cancer
cells
.

We
found
that
WEV
alone
and
WEV
+
NP
decreased
the
viability
of
all
cell
types
tested
(
PCa
cells
isolated
from
patient
samples
,
PC3
cells
and
LNCaP
cells
)
using
an
MTT
assay
.

The
IC
(
50
)
values
were
determined
to
be
10
and
5
μg
/
mL
for
WEV
alone
and
WEV
+
NP
,
respectively
.

WEV
+
NP
decreased
the
surface
expression
of
the
CKRs
CXCR3
,
CXCR4
,
CXCR5
and
CXCR6
to
a
greater
extent
than
WEV
alone
and
subsequently
reduced
migration
and
the
invasion
response
of
the
cells
to
the
cognate
ligands
of
the
CKRs
(
CXCL10
,
CXCL12
,
CXCL13
and
CXCL16
,
respectively
)
.

Using
a
CFSE
proliferation
assay
,
we
found
that
WEV
+
NP
strongly
inhibited
epidermal
growth
factor-mediated
PCa
cell
proliferation
.

Furthermore
,
analysis
of
the
cell
cycle
indicated
that
WEV
+
NP
strongly
altered
the
cell
cycle
of
PCa
cells
and
enhanced
the
induction
of
apoptosis
.

Finally
,
we
demonstrated
that
WEV
+
NP
robustly
decreased
the
expression
of
anti-apoptotic
effectors
,
such
as
B
cell
Lymphoma-2
(
Bcl-2
)
,
B
cell
Lymphoma-extra
large
(
Bcl-
(
XL
)
)
and
myeloid
cell
leukemia
sequence-1
(
Mcl-1
)
,
and
increased
the
expression
of
pro-apoptotic
effectors
,
such
as
Bcl-2
homologous
antagonist
/
killer
(
Bak
)
,
Bcl-2-associated
X
protein
(
Bax
)
and
Bcl-2-interacting
mediator
of
cell
death
(
Bim
)
.

WEV
+
NP
also
altered
the
membrane
potential
of
mitochondria
in
the
PCa
cells
.

increase
of

was
observed
after

administration
alone
.

PSM
pre-treatment
decreased
serum

MDA
levels
and
increased
the
levels
of

were
also
assessed
in
both

.

In
the
CCl4

,
pre-treatment

significantly
increased

Proliferative
diabetic

the
most
severe

complication
of

To
investigated
genetic
association
between
TCF7L2
and
PDR
in
Caucasian
type
2
diabetes
mellitus
(
T2DM
)
and
its
functional
consequences
,
383
T2DM
patients
with
PDR
(
T2DM-PDR
)
and
756
T2DM
patients
without
diabetic
retinopathy
(
T2DM-no
DR
)
were
genotyped
with
rs7903146
in
TCF7L2
.

We
found
that
risk

(
T

frequency
of
rs7903146
was
significantly
higher
in
T2DM-PDR
patients
(
allelic

.

In
lymphoblastoid
cells
induced
to
undergo

treatment
of

,
higher
fold
change

levels
were
observed
in

)
,
suggesting
ER
stress
plays
a
role
in
PDR
pathogenesis
.

Silencing
TCF7L2
resulted
in
decreased
mRNA
levels
of
both
TCF7L2
and
VEGFA
(

)
.

Retinas

Ovarian
epithelial
tumors

showed
an
apparent

.

Mucinous
carcinomas
were
closest
to
the
normal

,
whereas
serous
carcinomas
were
located
furthest
from
the
normal
group
.

All
mucinous
tumors
with
aggressive
histology
were
separated
from
the
low

(
LMP
)
group
.

The
benign-looking

adjacent
to
the
intraepithelial

(

)
showed
an
expression
pattern
identical
to
that
of
the
IEC
area
.

The
extent
of
change
on
the
lineages
leading
to
the
mucinous

was

98-fold
different
.

The
overall
gene
expression
profiles
of
serous
or
endometrioid
carcinomas
appeared
to
be
less
affected
by
grade
or
stage
than
by
histologic
type
.

The
potential
candidate
biomarkers
screened
in
ovarian

and
found
to
be
significantly
up-regulated
in
comparison
to
normal

were
as
follows
:
NM23
,
annexin-1

protein
phosphatase-1
,
ferritin

,
proteasome

,
and

In

,
ovarian

are
distinct
from
other

Overall
,
our
results
suggest
that
inhibition
or
absence
of
AChE
increases
evoked
quantal
release
by
involving
muscarinic
receptors
(
mAChRs
)
,
while
BChE
inhibition
decreases
release
through
direct
or
indirect
mechanisms
not
involving
mAChRs
.

BChE
apparently
is
not
implicated
in
limiting
the
duration
of
acetylcholine
action
on
postsynaptic
receptors
,
but
is
involved
in
a
presynaptic
modulatory
step
of
the
release
process
.

The
dopamine
D3
receptor
(
DRD3
)
in
the
ventral
striatum
is
thought
to
influence
motivation
and
motor
functions
.

Although
the
expression
of
DRD3
in
the
ventral
striatum
has
been
shown
to
exhibit
24-hour
variations
,
the
mechanisms
underlying
the
variation
remain
obscure
.

Here
,
we
demonstrated
that
molecular
components
of
the
circadian
clock
act
as
regulators
that
control
the
24-hour
variation
in
the
expression
of
DRD3
.

The
transcription
of
DRD3
was
enhanced
by
the
retinoic
acid-related
orphan
receptor
α
(
RORα
)
,
and
its
activation
was
inhibited
by
the
orphan
receptor
REV-ERBα
,
an
endogenous
antagonist
of
RORα
.

The
serum
or
dexamethasone-induced
oscillation
in
the
expression
of
DRD3
in
cells
was
abrogated
by
the
downregulation
or
overexpression
of
REV-ERBα
,
suggesting
that
REV-ERBα
functions
as
a
regulator
of
DRD3
oscillations
in
the
cellular
autonomous
clock
.

Chromatin
immunoprecipitation
assays
of
the
DRD3
promoter
indicated
that
the
binding
of
the
REV-ERBα
protein
to
the
DRD3
promoter
increased
in
the
early
dark
phase
.

DRD3
protein
expression
varied
with
higher
levels
during
the
dark
phase
.

Moreover
,
the
effects
of
the
DRD3
agonist
7-hydroxy-N
,
N-dipropyl-2-aminotetralin
(
7-OH-DPAT
)
-induced
locomotor
hypoactivity
were
significantly
increased
when
DRD3
proteins
were
abundant
.

These
results
suggest
that
RORα
and
REV-ERBα
consist
of
a
reciprocating
mechanism
wherein
RORα
upregulates
the
expression
of
DRD3
,
whereas
REV-ERBα
periodically
suppresses
the
expression
at
the
time
of
day
when
REV-ERBα
is
abundant
.

Our
present
findings
revealed
that
a
molecular
link
between
the
circadian
clock
and
the
function
of
DRD3
in
the
ventral
striatum
acts
as
a
modulator
of
the
pharmacological
actions
of
DRD3
agonists
/
antagonists
.

PURPOSE
:
The
effect
of
gemfibrozil
is
mediated
by
the
activation
of
peroxisome
proliferator-activated
receptor
alpha
(
PPAR
alpha
)
.

The
objective
of
this
study
was
to
determine
whether
the
lipid
response
to
gemfibrozil
therapy
is
influenced
by
the
PPAR
alpha-L162V
polymorphism
.

METHODS
:
Sixty-three
abdominally
obese
men
were
randomly
assigned
to
a
6-month-intervention
program
with
either
receiving
a
placebo
(
N
=
31
)
or
gemfibrozil
(
N
=
32
)
.

RESULTS
:
In
response
to
gemfibrozil
therapy
,
L162-homozygotes
exhibited
a
5
.
5%
increase
in
high-density

0%
increase
among
carriers
of
the
V162
allele
(

)
.

CONCLUSION
:
These
results
suggest
that
the
HDL
(
2
)
-C
response
to
gemfibrozil
is
modulated
by
the
PPAR
alpha-L162V
polymorphism
.

Glycine
and
gamma-aminobutyric
acid
(
GABA
)
are
the
major
inhibitory
neurotransmitters
in
the
retina
.

Approximately
half
of
the
amacrine
cells
release
glycine
at
their
synapses
with
bipolar
,
other
amacrine
,
and
ganglion
cells
.

Whereas
the
retinal
distributions
of
glycine
receptor
(
GlyR
)
subunits
alpha1
,
alpha2
,
and
alpha3
have
been
mapped
,
the
role
of
the
alpha4
subunit
in
retinal
circuitry
remains
unclear
.

A
rabbit
polyclonal
antiserum
was
raised
against
a
peptide
that
comprises
the
C-terminal
14
amino
acids
of
the
mouse
GlyR
alpha4
subunit
.

Using
immunocytochemistry
,
we
localized
the
alpha4
subunit
in
the
inner
plexiform
layer
(
IPL
)
in
brightly
fluorescent
puncta
,
which
represent
postsynaptically
clustered
GlyRs
.

This
was
shown
by
double-labeling
sections
for
GlyR
alpha4
and
synaptic
markers
(
bassoon
,
gephyrin
)
.

Double-labeling
sections
for
GlyR
alpha4
and
the
other
GlyR
alpha
subunits
shows
that
they
are
mostly
clustered
at
different
synapses;
however
,
approximately
30%
of
the
alpha4-containing
synapses
also
express
the
alpha2
subunit
.

We
also
studied
the
pre-
and
postsynaptic
partners
at
GlyR
alpha4-containing
synapses
and
found
that
displaced
(
ON-
)
cholinergic
amacrine
cells
prominently
expressed
the
alpha4
subunit
.

The
density
of
GlyR
alpha4-expressing
synapses
in
wildtype
,
Glra1
(
ot
/
ot
)
,
and
Glra3
(
-
/
-
)
mouse
retinas
did
not
differ
significantly
.

Thus
,
there
is
no
apparent
compensation
of
the
loss
of
alpha1
or
alpha3
subunits
by
an
upregulation
of
alpha4
subunit
gene
expression;
however
,
the
alpha2
subunit
is
moderately
upregulated
.

Poor
aqueous
solubility
of
an
active
pharmaceutical
ingredient
(
API
)
is
one
of
the
most
pressing
problems
in
pharmaceutical
research
and
development
because
up
to
90%
of
new
API
candidates
under
development
are
poorly
water
soluble
.

These
drugs
usually
have
a
low
and
variable
oral
bioavailability
,
and
therefore
an
unsatisfactory
therapeutic
effect
.

One
of
the
most
promising
approaches
to
increase
dissolution
rate
and
solubility
of
these
drugs
is
the
conversion
of
a
crystalline
form
of
the
drug
into
its
respective
amorphous
form
,
usually
by
incorporation
into
hydrophilic
polymers
,
forming
glass
solutions
.

However
,
this
strategy
only
led
to
a
small
number
of
marketed
products
usually
because
of
inadequate
physical
stability
of
the
drug
(
crystallization
)
.

In
this
study
,
we
investigated
a
fundamentally
different
approach
to
stabilize
the
amorphous
form
of
drugs
,
namely
the
use
of
amino
acids
as
small
molecular
weight
excipients
that
form
specific
molecular
interactions
with
the
drug
resulting
in
co-amorphous
forms
.

The
two
poorly
water
soluble
drugs
carbamazepine
and
indomethacin
were
combined
with
amino
acids
from
the
binding
sites
of
the
biological
receptors
of
these
drugs
.

Mixtures
of
drug
and
the
amino
acids
arginine
,
phenylalanine
,
tryptophan
and
tyrosine
were
prepared
by
vibrational
ball
milling
.

Solid-state
characterization
with
X-ray
powder
diffraction
(
XRPD
)
and
differential
scanning
calorimetry
(
DSC
)
revealed
that
the
various
blends
could
be
prepared
as
homogeneous
,
single
phase
co-amorphous
formulations
indicated
by
the
appearance
of
an
amorphous
halo
in
the
XRPD
diffractograms
and
a
single
glass
transition
temperature
(
Tg
)
in
the
DSC
measurements
.

In
addition
,
the
Tgs
of
the
co-amorphous
mixtures
were
significantly
increased
over
those
of
the
individual
drugs
.

The
drugs
remained
chemically
stable
during
the
milling
process
and
the
co-amorphous
formulations
were
generally
physically
stable
over
at
least
6months
at
40°C
under
dry
conditions
.

The
dissolution
rate
of
all
co-amorphous
drug-amino
acid
mixtures
was
significantly
increased
over
that
of
the
respective
crystalline
and
amorphous
pure
drugs
.

Amino
acids
thus
appear
as
promising
excipients
to
solve
challenges
connected
with
the
stability
and
dissolution
of
amorphous
drugs
.
The
antiplatelet
drug
,
ticlopidine
(
TIC
)
,
reportedly
causes
cholestatic
liver
injuries
.

The
present
study
analyzed
the
effect
of
TIC
on
bile
formation
,
revealing
that
the
biliary
secretion
of
phospholipids
was
significantly
decreased
in
TIC-administered
Sprague
Dawley
(
SD
)
rats
.

However
,
the
effect
of
TIC
on
biliary
phospholipids
was
not
observed
in
SD
rats
pretreated
with
diethylaminoethyl
diphenylpropylacetate
that
inhibits
cytochrome
P450s
(
P450
)
,
or
in
Eisai
hyperbilirubinemic
rats
(
EHBR
)
lacking
functional
multidrug
resistance-associated
protein
2
(
MRP2
/
ABCC2
)
.

These
results
suggest
that
glutathione-conjugated
TIC
metabolites
(
TIC-SGs
)
,
which
were
formed
in
the
liver
after
P450s-mediated
metabolism
and
were
excreted
extensively
into
bile
by
MRP2
,
mediated
the
observed
alterations
of
the
bile
composition
.

Administration
of
TIC
caused
significant
liver
injuries
in
SD
rats
,
with
decreased
biliary
phospholipids
,
but
not
in
EHBR
,
consistent
with
the
in
vitro
observation
that
phospholipid-bile
acid-mixed
micelles
moderated
the
cytotoxic
effects
of
bile
acids
.

Further
analyses
revealed
that
TIC-SGs
did
not
directly
inhibit
multidrug
resistance
3
P-glycoprotein
(
MDR3
/
ABCB4
)
-mediated
phosphatidylcholine
efflux
in
vitro
.

Because
the
diminished
biliary
secretion
of
phospholipids
with
TIC
administration
was
restored
by
taurocholate
infusion
in
SD
rats
,
the
decreased
biliary
concentration
of
bile
acids
,
due
to
the
stimulation
of
bile
acid-independent
bile
flow
driven
by
TIC-SGs
,
might
have
indirectly
attenuated
phospholipid
secretion
.

In
conclusion
,
extensive
biliary
excretion
of
TIC-SGs
decreased
the
biliary
secretion
of
phospholipids
,
which
might
have
increased
the
risk
of
TIC-induced
cholestatic
liver
injury
.
BACKGROUND
:
Glutathione
transferases
(
GST
)
detoxify
environmental
and
endogenous
compounds
and
levels
of
two
polymorphic
GST
proteins
,
GSTM3
and
GSTP1
,
are
high
in
the
brain
.

Previous
studies
of
GSTM3
and
GSTP1
polymorphisms
and
adult
brain
tumor
risk
have
produced
inconsistent
results
,
whereas
the
GSTM3
-63
variant
is
newly
identified
and
,
therefore
,
has
not
yet
been
studied
in
this
context
.

We
therefore
examined
associations
between
GSTM3
-63
,
GSTM3
*A
/
*B
,
GSTP1
105
,
and
GSTP1
114
variants
and
adult

and
the

of
the

of
these

polymorphisms
with

.

In
addition
,
the
enzymes
NQO1
and
CYP1A1
alter
susceptibility
to
oxidative

damage
.

Because
there
is
less
previous
evidence
for
a
role
of
NQO1
,
CYP1A1
,
GSTM1
,
and
GSTT1
variants
,
we
restricted
analysis
of
these
variants
to
a
small
preliminary
study
.

METHODS

Phenotypic
characterisation
of
the
human

pUL54
DNA
polymerase
is
a
useful
tool
for
testing
for
mutations
in
the
UL54
gene
thought
to
render
HCMV
resistant
to
foscarnet
.

In
this
study
,
an
in-house
non-isotopic
method
for
assessing
polymerase
enzymatic
activity
in
the
presence
and
absence
of
foscarnet
was
developed
and
its
utility
for
HCMV
polymerase
phenotyping
evaluated
.

Polymerase
activity
was
assessed
by
monitoring
the
incorporation
of
digoxigenin-labelled
nucleotides
into
the
growing
DNA
chain
and
foscarnet
concentrations
inhibiting
enzymatic
activity
by
50%
were
determined
.

HCMV
DNA
polymerases
were
synthesised
in
vitro
by
expression
of
UL54
under
the
control
of
the
T7
promoter
.

Mutations
of
interest
were
introduced
into
the
wild-type
UL54
gene
by
site-directed
mutagenesis
.

Mutated
polymerases
and
polymerases
from
HCMV
reference
strains
were
studied
.

The
activity
of
polymerases
containing
mutations
known
to
confer
resistance
to
foscarnet
(
V715M
,
T700A
and
N495K
)
was
inhibited
by
concentrations
of
foscarnet
eight
to
14
times
higher
than
those
required
to
inhibit
wild-type
polymerases
.

Our
in-house
non-radioactive
phenotypic
assay
was
sensitive
and
reproducible
.

It
is
also
easy
to
perform
and
could
provide
a
convenient
method
for
characterising
mutations
conferring
resistance
to
foscarnet
in
HCMV

which
is

.

This

.

Alprenolol

also
caused

RATIONALE
:
Selective

,
in
addition
to
being
able
to
enhance
serotonergic
neurotransmission
,
are
able
to
modulate
other
brain
systems
involved
in
depression
.

OBJECTIVES
:
This
study
evaluates
the
neurochemical
effect
of
the
SSRI
citalopram
on
brain
noradrenergic
activity
and
the
serotonin
receptor
involved
in
this
effect
.

METHODS
:
Dual-probe
microdialysis
in
the
locus
coeruleus
(
LC
)
and
prefrontal
cortex
(

)
was
performed
in
freely

rats
.

RESULTS
:
Systemic
citalopram
(

)
increased
noradrenaline
(
NA
)
in

LC
(
E

%
)
and
simultaneously
decreased
NA
in
the
PFC
(
Emax

%
)
.

In
the
local
presence
into
the
LC
of
the
α2-adrenoceptor
antagonist
RS79948
(
1
μM
)
,
systemic
citalopram
increased
NA
in
the
LC
(
Emax
=
157
±
25
%
)
and
PFC
(
Emax
=
175
±
24
%
)
.

Local
citalopram
(

)
into
the
LC
induced
NA
increase
in
the
LC
(
Emax
=
210
±
25
%
)
and
decrease
in
the
PFC
(
Emax
=
-38
±
9
%
)
.

Local
LC
citalopram
effect
was
abolished
by
LC
presence
of
the
5-HT3

MDL72222
(
1
μM
)
but
not
the
5-HT1

receptor
antagonist
methiothepin
(
1
μM
)
.

Systemic
citalopram
in
the
LC
presence
of
MDL72222
did
not
modify
NA
in
the
LC
but
increased
NA
in
the
PFC
(
Emax
=
158
±
26
%
)
.

Local
citalopram
into
the
PFC
enhanced
NA
(
Emax
=
376
±
18
%
)
in
the
area
,
which
was
prevented
by
MDL72222
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
The
SSRI
citalopram
modulates
central
noradrenergic
neurotransmission
by
activation
,
through
endogenous
serotonin
,
of
5-HT3
receptors
expressed
in
the
somatodendritic
(
LC
)
and
terminal
(
PFC
)
areas
,
which
subsequently
promote
an
enhancement
of
local
NA
.

Therefore
,
5-HT3
receptors
and
somatodendritic
α2-adrenoceptors
in
the
LC
play
an
important
role
in
the
global
effect
of
SSRIs

BACKGROUND
:
Voltage-gated

is
important
for
hyperexcitability
leading
to
pain

.

Sodium
channel
blockers
currently
used

Getting

We

propose
a

already
marketed
as
anticonvulsant

METHODS

CONCLUSIONS
:
At
doses
alleviating

amitriptyline
showed
alteration
of
behavioral
response
possibly
related
to
either
alteration
of
basal

effect
or
both
.

Side-effects
and
drug
tolerance

compliance
are
major
problems
with
drugs
such
as
amitriptyline
.

Rufinamide
seems
to
have
a
better
tolerability

could
be
a
new
alternative
to
explore
for
the
treatment
of

Natriuretic
peptides
,
beside
their
endocrine
actions
,
have
paracrine
functions
which
include
regulating
glucose
uptake
and
metabolism
.

Atrial
natriuretic
peptide
(
ANP
)
actions
are
mediated
by
cGMP
which
is
implicated
in
the
metabolic
adaptation
of
glucose
metabolism
to
oxygen
deprivation
in
the
heart
.

Although
,
it
has
been
reported
that
ANP
increases
glucose
uptake
,
cGMP
decreases
it
.

The
aim
of
the
present
paper
was
to
evaluate
the
role
of
the
glucose
transporters
1
and
4
(
GLUTS
)
,
in
glucose
uptake
produced
by
ANP
in
fatty
acid-dependent
adult
cardiomyocytes
and
glucose-dependent
neonatal
cardiomyocytes
under
oxygenation
and
hypoxia
,
which
reverts
adult
metabolism
to
glucose-dependent
.

We
also
explored
if
the
calcium-calmodulin
complex
participates
in
ANP-induced
increase
in
glucose
uptake
.

Neonatal
cells
had
a
higher
glucose
uptake
than
adult
cells
and
GLUT
1
participated
in
basal
uptake
in
both
cell
types
.

Hypoxia
increased
glucose
uptake
in
adult
cardiomyocytes
but
not
in
neonatal
cells
and
this
increase
in
glucose
uptake
was
mediated
by
GLUT4
.

ANP
increased
glucose
uptake
in
both
adult
and
neonatal
myocytes
,
under
oxygenation
and
hypoxia
,
and
GLUT4
favored
this
increase
.

Neonatal
cells
were
less
sensitive
to
ANP
.

Trifluoperazine
,
a
calcium-calmodulin
blocker
,
inhibited
the
ANP-induced
increase
in
glucose
uptake
.

This
suggests
that
ANP
promotes
GLUT
4
calcium-mediated
recruitment
to
the
cell
membrane
.

In
conclusion
,
glucose
uptake
regulation
is
one
of
the
paracrine
metabolic
effects
of
ANP
in
adult
and
neonatal
cardiomyocytes
under
oxygenation
and
hypoxia
.

This
effect
of
this
peptide
could
explain
the
beneficial
effects
found
in
the
internal
medicine
and
surgical
fields
.

widely
accepted
by
consumers
all
over
the
world
.

In
this
work
,
phytochemical
investigation
of
litchi
pericarp
methanol
extracts
led
to
the
isolation
of
a
novel
phenolic
,
2-
(
2-hydroxyl-5-
(
methoxycarbonyl
)
phenoxy
)
benzoic
acid
,
together
with
kaempferol
,
isolariciresinol
,
stigmasterol
,
butylated
hydroxytoluene
,
3
,
4-dihydroxyl
benzoate
,
methyl
shikimate
and
ethyl
shikimate
.

Most
were
found
in
litchi
pericarp
for
the
first
time
.

Their
structures
were
mainly
elucidated
by
NMR
and
MS
evidences
.

Antioxidant
activities
of
the
eight
compounds
were
determined
by
a
DPPH
radical
scavenging
assay
and
the
results
showed
that
2-
(
2-hydroxy-5-
(
methoxycarbonyl
)
phenoxy
)
benzoic
acid
,
kaempferol
,
isolariciresinol
,
butylated
hydroxytoluene
and
3
,
4-dihydroxy
benzoate
exhibited
good
antioxidant
activities
.

An
interesting
finding
was
that
butylated
hydroxytoluene
was
detected
as
a
natural
antioxidant
in
this
work
,
which
was
usually
taken
as
a
synthesized
antioxidant
.

Furthermore
,
the
novel
compound
exhibited
no
inhibitory
effects
against
tyrosinase
and
α-glucosidase
activities
.
Peptides
designed
from
osteoprotegerin
(
OPG
)
have
previously
been
shown
to
inhibit
receptor
activator
of
NF-κB
ligand
(
RANKL
)
and
prevent
bone
loss
without
significantly
inhibiting
inflammation
.

The
objective
of
this
study
was
to
develop
a
novel
peptide
with
dual
inhibitory
activity
against
bone
loss
and
inflammation
using
site-directed
mutagenesis
.

Out
of
the
three
putative
sites
(
i
.

e
.

,
Tyr70-Asp78
,
Tyr82-Glu96
,
and
Leu113-Arg122
)
available
on
OPG
for
RANKL
binding
,
Leu113-Arg122
was
used
as
a
template
for
peptide
synthesis
.

Peptide
mutants
of
the
template
sequence
(
112YLEIEFCLKHR122
)
were
synthesized
and
initially
screened
for
their
inhibitory
effect
on
RANK-RANKL
binding
by
competitive
ELISA
.

The
most
active
peptide
was
further
evaluated
in
vitro
for
RANKL
induced
osteoclastogenesis
in
mouse
macrophage
cells
,
and
in
vivo
for
Freund's
complete
adjuvant
induced
arthritis
(
AIA
)
in
Lewis
rats
.

The
efficacy
of
the
candidate
peptide
was
compared
with
that
of
the
standard
drug
celecoxib
.

The
peptide
YR-11
(
YLEIEFSLKHR
)
,
obtained
by
direct
substitution
of
cysteine
with
a
serine
residue
in
the
template
sequence
,
significantly
(
p<0
.
05
)
inhibited
RANK-RANKL
binding
,
and
RANKL
induced
TRAP
activity
and
formation
of
multinucleated
osteoclasts
without
any
cytotoxicity
.

Administration
of
YR-11
peptide
at
the
dose
of
30mg
/
kg
(
i
.

p
.

)
ameliorated
both
bone
loss
and
inflammation
in
AIA
rats
.

To
elucidate
the
mechanism
for
inhibition
of
inflammation
in
arthritic
rats
,
serum
and
tissue
cytokines
(
TNF-α
,
IL-1β
,
and
IL-6
)
were
analyzed
by
ELISA
and
RT-PCR
methods
.

Results
confirmed
that
YR-11
peptide
inhibited
pro-inflammatory
cytokines
in
the
sera
and
hind
paw
tissues
of
AIA
rats
through
its
suppressive
effect
on
RANKL
induced
nuclear
translocation
of
NF-κB
.

The
results
obtained
in
this
study
substantiate
the
therapeutic
benefit
of
this
novel
peptide
in
the
prevention
of
bone
loss
and
inflammation
in
rheumatoid
arthritis
with
reduced
side
effects

cDNA
encoding
a
novel
phosphodiesterase
(
PDE
)
was
isolated
from
a
human
fetal
lung
cDNA
library
and
designated
PDE10A
.

The
deduced
amino
acid
sequence
contains
779
amino
acids
,
including
a
putative
cGMP
binding
sequence
in
the
amino-terminal
portion
of
the
molecule
and
a
catalytic
domain
that
is
16-47%
identical
in
amino
acid
sequence
to
those
of
other
PDE
families
.

Recombinant
PDE10A
transfected
and
expressed
in

,
respectively
,
and
Vmax
with

was
almost
twice
that
with
cAMP
.

Of
the
PDE

tested
,
dipyridamole
was
most
effective
,
with
IC50
values
of
1
.
2
and
0

45
microM
for
inhibition
of
cAMP
and
cGMP

,
respectively
.

cGMP
inhibited
hydrolysis
of
cAMP
,
and
cAMP
inhibited
cGMP
hydrolysis
with
IC50
values
of
14
and
0
.
39
microM
,
respectively
.

Thus
,
PDE10A
exhibited
properties
of
a
cAMP
PDE
and
a
cAMP-inhibited
cGMP
PDE
.

PDE10A
transcripts
were
particularly
abundant
in
the
putamen
and
caudate
nucleus
regions
of
brain
and
in
thyroid
and
testis
,
and
in
much
lower
amounts
in
other
tissues
.

The
PDE10A
gene
was
located
on

To
overcome
the
limitations
of
in

exposure
of
submerged
lung
cells
to
nanoparticles
(
NPs
)
,
we
validated
an
integrated
low
flow
system
capable
of
generating
and
depositing
airborne
NPs
directly
onto
cells
at
an
air-liquid
interface
(

The

to
provide

efficiency
to

This
system
delivered
a

airborne
exposure
of

cells
without
loss
of
cell
viability
in
repeated
4h
exposure
periods
.

We
sequentially
exposed
cells
to
air-delivered
copper
(
Cu
)
NPs
in

to
compare
toxicity
results
to
our
prior
in

studies
.

The
evaluation
of
cellular

indicated
that
a
large
amount
of
Cu
was
taken
up
,
dissolved
and
released
into
the
basolateral
medium
(
62%
of
total
mass
)
.

Exposure
to
Cu
NPs
decreased
cell

Our
results
show
that
this

is
useful
for
screening
of

a
manner
that
represents

Six

Neuronal
nicotinic
receptors
are
ligand-gated
ion
channels
of
the
central
and
peripheral
central
nervous
system
that
regulate
synaptic
activity
from
both
pre-
and
postsynaptic
sites
.

The
present
study
establishes
the
acute
interaction
of
bupropion
,
an
antidepressant
agent
that
is
also
effective
in
nicotine
dependence
,
with
nicotine
and
nicotinic
receptors
using
different
in
vivo
and
in
vitro
tests
.

Bupropion
was
found
to
block
nicotine's
antinociception
(
in
two
tests
)
,
motor
effects
,
hypothermia
,
and
convulsive
effects
with
different
potencies
in
the
present
investigation
,
suggesting
that
bupropion
possesses
some
selectivity
for
neuronal
nicotinic
receptors
underlying
these
various
nicotinic
effects
.

In
addition
,
bupropion
blocks
nicotine
activation
of
alpha
(
3
)
beta
(
2
)
,
alpha
(
4

,
and
alpha
(
7
)
neuronal
acetylcholine
nicotinic
receptors
(
nAChRs
)
with
some
degree
of
selectivity
.

It
was
approximately
50
and
12
times
more
effective
in
blocking
alpha
(
3
)
beta
(
2
)
and
alpha
(
4
)
beta
(
2
)
than
alpha
(
7
.

)
This
functional
blockade
was
noncompetitive
,
because
it
was
insurmountable
by
increasing
concentration
of
ACh
in
the
nAChRs
subtypes
tested
.

Furthermore
,
bupropion
at
high
concentration
failed
to
displace
brain
[
(

)
H
]
nicotine
binding
sites
,
a
site
largely
composed
of
alpha
(
4
)
beta
(
2
)
subunit
combination
.

Given
the
observation
that
bupropion
inhibition
of
alpha
(
3
)
beta
(
2
)
and
alpha
(
4
)
beta
(
2
)
receptors
exhibits
voltage-independence
properties
,
bupropion
may
not
be
acting
as
an
open
channel
blocker
.

These
effects
may
explain
in
part
bupropion's
efficacy
in
nicotine
dependence
.

Our
present
findings
suggest
that
functional
blockade
of
neuronal
nAChRs
are
useful
in
nicotine

3-Methylcholanthrene
(
MC
)
is
a
readily
metabolized
aryl

agonist
.

MC
disrupts

of
mouse
hepatic
growth

a
male-specific
gene
controlled
by
pulsatile
GH
via
signal
transducer
and
activator
of
transcription
5b
(
STAT5b
)
.

To
determine
if
these
effects
of
MC
depend
on
hepatic
microsomal
P450-mediated
activity
,
we
examined
biologic
responses
to
MC
treatment
in

Cpr-null
(
LCN
)
mice
with
hepatocyte-specific
conditional
deletion
of

)
.

MC
caused
mild
induction
of
Por
and
a
hepatic
inflammatory
marker
in
wild-type
mice
,
whereas
MC
caused
strong
induction
of
AHR
target
genes
,
Cyp1a1
,
Cyp1a2
,
and
Cyp1b1
in
wild-type
and

mice
.

Two
mouse
hepatic
STAT5b
target
genes
,
Cyp2d9
and
major
urinary
protein
2
(
Mup2
)
,
were
suppressed
by
MC
in
wild-type
mice
,
and
the
CYP2D9
mRNA
response
was
maintained
in
LCN
mice
.

In
wild-type
mice
only
,
MC
decreased
hepatic
GH
receptor
(
GHR
)
mRNA
but
increased
GHR
protein
levels
.

There
was
an
apparent
impairment
of
STAT5
phosphorylation
by
MC
in
wild-type
and
LCN
mice
,
but
large
interanimal
variation
prevented
achievement
of
statistical
significance
.

In
vehicle-treated
mice
,
basal
levels

MUP2
mRNA
,
GHR
mRNA
,
GHR
protein
,
and
the
activation
status
of
extracellular
signal-regulated
kinase
2
and
Akt
were
influenced
by
hepatic
Por
genetic
status
.

These
results
indicate
that
the
effects
of
MC
on
hepatic
GH
signaling
components
and
target
genes
are
complex
,
involving
aspects
that
are
both
dependent

of
25-hydroxyvitamin
D
as
well
as
CRP
were
compared
with
4β-hydroxycholesterol
levels
.

In
addition
,
all
participants
were
genotyped
for
two
polymorphisms
(
Taq1
and
Foq1
)
in
the
vitamin
D
receptor
gene
.

There
was
no
significant
correlation
between
individual
serum
levels
of
25-hydroxyvitamin
D
and
4β-hydroxycholesterol
.

However
,
a
moderate
,
but
statistically
significant
,
negative
correlation
between
CRP
and
4β-hydroxycholesterol
levels
was
observed
.

This
study
in
patients
with
highly
variable
serum
levels
of
25-hydroxyvitamin
D
could
not
reveal
any
relationship
between
vitamin
D
and
4β-hydroxycholesterol
,
an
endogenous
biomarker
of
CYP3A
activity
.

However
,
the
negative
correlation
between
CRP
and
4β-hydroxycholesterol
supports
earlier
experimental
results
that
inflammation
may
suppress
hepatic
CYP3A
activity
,
a
finding
of
potentially
high
clinical
relevance
that
warrants
further
exploration
.
The
feasibility
of
administering
a
relatively
high
dose
of
the
gonadotrophin-releasing
hormone
(
GnRH
)
antagonist
ganirelix
by
means
of
a
needle-free
injection
device
,
which
could
be
useful
in
the
long-term
treatment
of
sex-steroid-dependent
disorders
,
was
evaluated
in
a
randomized
,
crossover
study
in
16
healthy
females
.

Local
tolerance
and
pharmacokinetics
of
ganirelix
administered
by
MediJector
versus
conventional
needle
injections
were
compared
.

Additionally
,
the
pharmacodynamic
effect
was
evaluated
.

Two
milligrams
of
ganirelix
was
administered
s
.

c
.

once
daily
for
7
days
by
Medi-Jector
or
conventional
needle
in
a
randomized
sequence
,
without
a
washout
period
.

No
apparent
differences
in
local
tolerance
were
observed
.

Most
injections
(
87
.
5%
)
gave
either
no
or
only
a
mild
reaction
.

Of
the
moderate
reactions
,
swelling
and
redness
were
reported
most
frequently
(
overall
4
.
9
and
8
.
5%
per
injection
,
respectively
)
.

Administration
by
Medi-Jector
was
bioequivalent
to
conventional
needle
injection
with
respect
to
the
peak
concentration
and
area
under
the
curve
.

A
profound
suppression
of
luteinizing
hormone
and
follicle
stimulating
hormone
was
observed
.

Serum
oestradiol
and
progesterone
concentrations
were
relatively
low
prior
to
treatment
and
remained
low
during
the
entire
study
period
.

In
conclusion
,
administration
of
a
relatively
high
dose
of
ganirelix
by
Medi-Jector
might
be
useful
for
long-term
treatment
of
sex-steroid
dependent
disorders
.

BACKGROUND
&
AIMS
:
It
has
been
variably
suggested
that
nonselective
NSAIDs
and
cyclooxygenase
(
COX
)
-2
selective
inhibitors
aggravate
or
ameliorate
clinical
disease
activity
in
patients
with
inflammatory
bowel
disease
.

We
assessed
the
effect
of
these
drugs
in
patients
with
inflammatory
bowel
disease
(
n
=
209
)
and
the
possible
mechanisms
.

METHODS
:
First
,
patients
with
quiescent
Crohn's
disease
and
ulcerative
colitis
received
the
non-NSAID
analgesic
acetaminophen
(
n
=
26
)
and
the
conventional
NSAIDs
naproxen
(
n
=
32
)
,
diclofenac
(
n
=
29
)
,
and
indomethacin
(
n
=
22
)
for
4
weeks
.

The
Harvey-Bradshaw
index
was
used
to
define
relapse
.

Second
,
to
assess
the
mechanism
of
relapse
,
intestinal
inflammation
was
quantitated
(
fecal
calprotectin
)
before
and
during
treatment
(
20
patients
/
group
)
with
acetaminophen
,
naproxen
(
topical
effect
,
COX-1
and
-2
inhibitor
)
,
nabumetone
(
COX-1
and
-2
inhibitor
)
,
nimesulide
(
selective
COX-2
inhibitor
)
,
and
low-dose
aspirin
(
selective
COX-1
inhibition
)
.

RESULTS
:
Nonselective
NSAIDs
were
associated
with
a
17%-28%
relapse
rate
within
9
days
of
ingestion
.

No
patient
had
an
early
relapse
on
acetaminophen
,
nimesulide
,
or
aspirin
,
whereas
those
on
naproxen
and
nabumetone
(
20%
)
experienced
relapse
.

These
clinical
relapses
were
associated
with
escalating
intestinal
inflammatory
activity
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
NSAID
ingestion
is
associated
with
frequent
and
early
clinical
relapse
of
quiescent
inflammatory
bowel
disease
,
and
the
mechanism
appears
to
be
due
to
dual
inhibition
of
the
COX
enzymes
.

Selective
COX-2
inhibition
with
nimesulide
and
COX-1
inhibition
with
low-dose
aspirin
appear
to
be
well-tolerated
in
the
short-term
.

Several
receptors
which
bind
the
hormone
AMY
(
amylin
)
with
high
affinity
have
now
been
identified
.

The
minimum
binding
unit
is
composed
of
the
CT
(
calcitonin
)
receptor
at
its
core
,
plus
a
RAMP
(
receptor
activity
modifying
protein
)
.

The
receptors
have
been
named
AMY
(
1
(
a
)
)
,
AMY
(
2
(
a
)
)
and
AMY
(

)
in

with
the
association
of
the
CT
receptor
(
CT
(
(
a
)
)
)
with
RAMP1
,
RAMP2
and
RAMP3
respectively
.

The
challenge
is
now
to
determine
the
localization
and
pharmacological
nature
of
each
of
these
receptors
.

Recent
attempts
to
achieve
these
aims
will
be
briefly
discussed
.
The
Neurospora
crassa
arg-2
and
the
Saccharomyces
cerevisiae
ortholog
CPA1
encode
the
arginine-specific
carbamoyl-phosphate
synthetase
(
CPS-A
)
small
subunit
.

Arginine
decreases
synthesis
of
this
subunit
through
the
action
of
a
5'
upstream
open
reading
frame
in
the
mRNA
that
encodes
a
cis-regulatory
element
,
the
arginine
attenuator
peptide
(
AAP
)
,
which
stalls
ribosomes
in
response
to
arginine
.

We
performed
a
comparative
analysis
of
the
genomic
structure
and
predicted
peptide
sequence
of
the
AAP
and
CPS-A
small
subunit
across
many
fungi
.

Differences
at
the
genomic
level
included
variation
in
intron
number
and
position
within
the
AAP
and
CPS-A
coding
regions
and
differences
in
known
regulatory
motifs
.

Although
differences
exist
in
AAP
sequence
,
there
were
three
absolutely
conserved
amino
acid
residues
in
the
predicted
peptide
,
including
an
aspartic
acid
crucial
for
arginine-dependent
regulation
of
arg-2
and
CPA1
.

A
diverged
Basidiomycete
AAP
was
shown
to
retain
function
as
an
Arg-specific
negative
regulator
of
translation
.

ViRexx
Medical
Corp
is
developing
the
murine
monoclonal
antibody
oregovomab
[
OvaRex
,
MAb
B43
.
13
]
for
the
treatment
of
ovarian
cancer
.

Oregovomab
targets
the
circulating
tumour-associated
antigen
CA
125
,
which
is
shed
from
the
surface
of
human
ovarian
cancer
cells;
the
antibodies
induce
broad
cellular
and
humoral
immune
responses
against
CA
125
via
complex
formation
.

Unlike
free
CA
125
,
CA
125-oregovomab
complexes
can
prime
dendritic
cells
,
leading
to
downstream
activation
of
T
cells
.

The
antibody
is
undergoing
advanced
clinical
development
.

AltaRex
,
the
originator
of
oregovomab
,
was
acquired
by
,
and
merged
into
,
ViRexx
Medical
Corp
in
December
2004
.

AltaRex
(
now
ViRexx
Medical
Corp
)
has
established
several
strategic
corporate
alliances
for
the
development
and
/
or
commercialisation
of
oregovomab
.

Unither
Pharmaceuticals
,
a
subsidiary
of
United
Therapeutics
Corporation
,
entered
into
a
licensing
agreement
with
ViRexx
in
April
2002
.

The
agreement
covers
most
territories
worldwide
,
except
Europe
and
the
Middle
East
,
which
are
covered
by
other
agreements
(
see
below
)
;
ViRexx
did
retain
the
rights
to
most
member
nations
of
the
EU
and
certain
other
countries
.

In
August
2003
,
the
agreement
was
extended
,
granting
United
Therapeutics
Corporation
development
rights
for
Germany
.

AltaRex
and
Dompe
entered
into
a
distribution
agreement
for
oregovomab
in
July
2004
.

Territories
included
in
the
agreement
are
Italy
,
Spain
,
Portugal
,
Hungary
,
Poland
,
Czech
Republic
,
Switzerland
,
Austria
and
certain
other
Eastern
European
countries
.

Under
the
terms
of
the
agreement
,
ViRexx
retains
responsibility
for
product
development
and
registration
of
the
antibody
,
upon
commercialisation
in
the
agreed
territory
.

The
two
companies
will
work
closely
to
achieve
product
registration
throughout
Europe
.

In
June
2001
,
Dompe
entered
into
a
sublicensing
agreement
with
FAES
for
the
commercialisation
of
oregovomab
in
Spain
and
Portugal
.

ViRexx
is
also
seeking
collaboration
partners
for
Northern
European
markets
.

Medison
Pharma
and
AltaRex
entered
into
an
agreement
in
April
2002
.

Under
the
terms
of
the
agreement
,
the
two
companies
will
establish
a
joint
venture
to
market
oregovomab
in
Israel
and
the
Middle
East
.

ViRexx
also
has
an
agreement
with
Genesis
Pharma
covering
the
commercialisation
of
the
antibody
in
Greece
,
Turkey
,
Cyprus
and
the
Balkans
.

Unither
Pharmaceuticals
has
completed
trial
enrollment
for
its
two
pivotal
phase
III
trials
investigating
oregovomab
for
the
treatment
of
advanced
ovarian
cancer
.

In
June
2006
,
Unither
reached
its
enrollment
goal
of
177
patients
for
the
IMPACT
II
study
,
the
second
of
two
identical
double-blind
,
placebo-controlled
trials
.

The
IMPACT
I
study
achieved
its
enrollment
target
in
December
2005
.

Both
IMPACT
studies
are
designed
to
assess
the
effect
of
oregovomab
on
time
to
disease
relapse
in
patients
with
advanced
ovarian
cancer
(
stage
III
/
IV
)
who
have
achieved
an
optimal
response
with
front-line
chemotherapy
,
and
are
being
conducted
at
over
60
sites
across
the
US
.

Data
from
the
studies
are
intended
to
support
registration
of
the
antibody
in
the
US
.

ViRexx
also
plans
to
utilise
results
from
the
IMPACT
studies
to
support
regulatory
filings
in
Europe
and
in
other
countries
.

In
addition
,
a
phase
II
trial
is
being
conducted
to
evaluate
two
dosing
regimens
of
adjunctive
oregovomab
plus
platinum-based
first-line
chemotherapy
in
patients
with
advanced
ovarian
cancer
.

The
enrollment
target
of
40
patients
has
been
achieved;
primary
study
analysis
is
anticipated
to
be
completed
by
the
end
of
2006
.

Several
phase
II
trials
with
oregovomab
as
monotherapy
or
in
combination
with
other
chemotherapeutics
have
been
completed
across
the
US
and
Canada
.

Clinical
trials
have
also
been
conducted
in
the
EU
,
but
ViRexx
has
suspended
such
EU
studies
on
the
basis
of
commercial
considerations
.

Oregovomab
has
orphan
drug
status
for
the
treatment
of
ovarian
cancer;
designation
was
granted
by
the
US
and
the
EU
in
1996
and
2002
,
respectively
.

In
addition
,
the
US
FDA
granted
fast-track
status
to
the
antibody
in
1998
.

AltaRex
(
now
ViRexx
Medical
Corp
)
has
been
awarded
the
US
patent
covering
the
company's
technology
for
administering
a
low
dose
of
foreign
antibody
to
patients
expressing
the
CA
125
antigen
.

A
second
US
patent
has
also
been
issued
for
oregovomab
covering
the
technique
of
photoactivation
using
ultraviolet
light
to
modify
antibodies
and
enhance
specific
beneficial
immune
responses
.

Furthermore
,
AltaRex
was
granted
a
'multi-epitopic'
patent
application
covering
oregovomab
by
the
European
Patent
Office
(
EPO
)
in
October
2003
.

The
patent
covers
the
company's
technology
of
IV
administration
of
a
low-dose
foreign
antibody
,
such
as
oregovomab
,
to
patients
expressing
the
target
tumour-associated
antigen
CA
125
.

The
EPO's
grant
of
the
patent
for
the
European
Union
enables
intellectual
property
protection
of
oregovomab
in
the
great
majority
of
worldwide

Estrogens
influence
cardiovascular
function
through
direct
and
indirect
effects
and
via
genomic
and
nongenomic
mechanisms
.

The
pathways
underlying
the
nongenomic
mechanisms
are
not
completely
understood
.

Estrogen-induced
responses
in
vascular
cells
have
been
shown
to
influence
prostaglandins
and
cyclooxygenase
(
COX
)
,
a
key
enzyme
in
the
production
of
prostaglandins
,
with
two
isoforms
,
COX-1
and
COX-2
.

We
investigated
the
effects
of
prostaglandins
on
the
acute
potentiation
by
17beta-estradiol
(
E
)
of
acetylcholine
(
ACh
)
-mediated
vasodilation
in
the
cutaneous
vasculature
.

Using
a
double-blind
placebo-controlled
design
,
we
assessed
skin
blood
flow
in
32
healthy
,
postmenopausal
women
by
laser
Doppler
velocimetry
with
direct
current
iontophoresis
of
ACh
and
sodium
nitroprusside
before
and
after
6-wk
treatment
periods
with
aspirin
(
a
nonspecific
COX-1
and
COX-2
inhibitor
)
,
diclofenac
(
predominantly
a
COX-2
inhibitor
,
which
also
inhibits
COX-1
)
,
celecoxib
(
a
specific
COX-2
inhibitor
)
,
given
at
anti-inflammatory
doses
,
or
placebo
.

Blood
flux
values
before
iontophoresis
of
ACh
did
not
differ
between
the
treatment
groups
or
after
E
administration
,
excluding
a
direct
cutaneous
vasodilator
effect
of
the
treatments
or
of
E
.

Acute
E
administration
enhanced
the
response
to
ACh
after
aspirin
,
diclofenac
,
and
placebo;
however
,
this
effect
was
completely
abolished
with
celecoxib
treatment
(
P
<
0
.
05
)
.

E
had
no
effect
on
sodium
nitroprusside-mediated
vasodilation
after
any
of
the
treatments
.

We
conclude
that
the
COX-2
pathway
plays
a
specific
role
in
the
rapid
E-induced
potentiation
of
cholinergic
vasodilation
in
postmenopausal
women

RATIONALE
:
Phasic
dopamine
(
DA
)
signaling
underlies
reward
learning
.

Cholinergic
and
glutamatergic
inputs
into
the
ventral
tegmental
area
(
VTA
)
are
crucial
for
modulating
burst
firing
activity
and
subsequent
phasic
DA
release
in
the
nucleus
accumbens
(
NAc
)
,
but
the
specific
VTA
nicotinic
receptor
subtypes
that
regulate
phasic
DA
release
have
not
been
identified
.

OBJECTIVE
:
The
goal
was
to
determine
the
role
of
VTA
N-methyl-D-aspartate
receptors
(
NMDARs
)
and
specific
subtypes
of
nicotinic
acetylcholine
receptors
(
nAChRs
)
in
regulating
phasic
DA
release
in
the
NAc
core
.

METHODS
:
Fast-scan
cyclic
voltammetry
in
anesthetized
rats
was
combined
with
intra-VTA
micro-infusion
to
evaluate
the
ability
of
glutamatergic
and
cholinergic
drugs
to
modulate
stimulated
phasic
DA
release
in
the
NAc
core
.

RESULTS
:
VTA
NMDAR
blockade
with
AP-5
decreased
,
while
VTA
NMDAR
activation
with
NMDA
increased
NAc
peak
phasic
DA
release
.

Intra-VTA
administration
of
the
nonspecific
nAChR
antagonist
mecamylamine
produced
a
persistent
decrease
in
phasic
DA
release
.

Infusion
of
the
α6-selective
antagonist
α-conotoxin
MII
(
α-ctx
MII
)
produced
a
robust
,
but
transient
decrease
in
phasic
DA
,
whereas
infusion
of
selective
doses
of
either
the
α4β2-selective
antagonist
,
dihydro-beta-erythroidine
,
or
the
α7
antagonist
,
methyllycaconitine
,
had
no
effect
.

Co-infusion
of
AP-5
and
α-ctx
MII
produced
a
similar
phasic
DA
decrease
as
either
drug
alone
,
with
no
additive
effect
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
The
results
suggest
that
VTA
α6β2
nAChRs
,
but
not
α4β2
or
α7
nAChRs
,
regulate
phasic
DA
release
in
the
NAc
core
and
that
VTA
α6β2
nAChRs
and
NMDA
receptors
act
at
a
common
site
or
target
to
regulate
NAc
phasic
DA
signaling

Ferredoxin

(
FDX1;
adrenodoxin
)
is
an
iron-sulfur
protein
that
is
involved
in
various
metabolic
processes
,
including
steroid
hormone
synthesis
in
mammalian
tissues
.

We
investigated
the
transcriptional
regulation
of
FDX1
in
ovarian
granulosa
cells
.

Previously
,
we
reported
that
the
NR5A
family
,
including
steroidogenic
factor-1
(
SF-1
)
and
liver
receptor
homolog-1
could
induce
differentiation
of
human
mesenchymal
stem
cells
(
hMSCs
)
into
steroidogenic
cells
.

A
ChIP
assay
showed
that
SF-1
could
bind
to
the
FDX1
promoter
in
differentiated
hMSCs
.

Luciferase
reporter
assays
showed
that
transcription
of
FDX1
was
synergistically
activated
by
the
NR5A
family
and
8Br-cAMP
treatment
through
two
SF-1
binding
sites
and
a

These
results
indicate
transcription

is
regulated
by
the
NR5A

and
cAMP

,
and
participates
in
steroid

Hepatic

activity
and
MAT1A
expression
are
compromised
under
pathological
conditions
such
as
alcoholic
liver
disease
and
hepatic
cirrhosis
,
and
this
gene
is
silenced
upon
neoplastic
transformation
of
the
liver
.

In
the
present
work
,
we
evaluated
whether
MAT1A
expression
could
be
targeted
by
the
polycyclic
arylhydrocarbon
(
PAH
)
3-methylcholanthrene
(
3-MC
)
in
rat
liver
and
cultured
hepatocytes
.

MAT1A
mRNA
levels
were
reduced
by
50%
following
in
vivo
administration
of
3-MC
to
adult
male
rats
(
100
mg
/
kg
,
p
.

o
.

,
4
days'

)
.

This
effect
was
reproduced
in
a
time-
and
dose-dependent
fashion
in
cultured
rat
hepatocytes
,
and
was
accompanied
by
the
induction
of
cytochrome
P450
1A1
gene
expression
.

This
action
of
3-MC
was
mimicked
by
other
PAHs
such
as
benzo
[
a
]
pyrene
and
benzo
[
e
]
pyrene
,
but
not
by
the
model
arylhydrocarbon
receptor
(
AhR
)
activator
2
,
3
,
7
,
8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin
.

3-MC
inhibited
transcription
driven
by
a
MAT1A
promoter-reporter
construct
transfected
into
rat
hepatocytes
,
but
MAT1A
mRNA
stability
was
not
affected
.

We
recently
showed
that
liver
MAT1A
expression
is
induced
by
AdoMet
in
cultured
hepatocytes
.

Here
,
we
observed
that
exogenously
added
AdoMet
prevented
the
negative
effects
of
3-MC
on
MAT1A
expression
.

Taken
together
,
our
data
demonstrate
that
liver
MAT1A
gene
expression
is
targeted
by
PAHs
,
independently
of
AhR
activation
.

The
effect
of
AdoMet
may
be
part
of
the
protective
action
of
this
molecule
in
liver
damage

BACKGROUND
:
There
have
been
many
studies
of
the
effect
of
high-dose
supplementation
of
vitamin
B6
on
children
and
adults
with
autism
,
with
all
but
one
reporting
benefits
.

OBJECTIVE
:
The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
investigate
the
biochemical
basis
for
vitamin
B6
therapy
by
measuring
the
level
of
total
vitamin
B6
in
the
plasma
of
unsupplemented
children
with
autism
spectrum
disorder
compared
to
unsupplemented
control
subjects
.

PARTICIPANTS
:
Children
with
autism
spectrum
disorders
(
n
=
35
,
age
3-9
years
)
and
unrelated
typical
children
(
n
=
11
,
age
6-9
years
)
,
all
from
Arizona
,
were
studied
.

(
This
includes
the
data
from
24
children
with
autism
from
our
previous
study
.

)
METHODOLOGY
:
A
microbiologic
assay
was
used
to
measure
the
level
of
total
vitamin
B6
(
including
phosphorylated
and
unphosphorylated
forms
)
,
in
a
blinded
fashion
.

RESULTS
:
Children
with
autism
had
a
75%
higher
level
of
total
vitamin
B6
than
the
controls
(
medians
of
56
versus
32
ng
/
mL
,
respectively
,
p
=
0
.
00002
)
.

Most
of
the
autistic
children
(
77%
)
had
levels
that
were
more
than
2
standard
deviations
above
the
median
value
of
the
controls
.

The
autistic
girls
(
n
=
5
)
also
had
elevated
levels
(
mean
of
54
.
6
ng
/
mL
,
median
of
60
ng
/
mL
)
.

DISCUSSION
:
These
results
are
consistent
with
previous
studies
that
found
that
:
(
1
)
pyridoxal
kinase
had
a
very
low
activity
in
children
with
autism
and
(
2
)
pyridoxal
5
phosphate
(
PLP
)
levels
are
unusually
low
in
children
with
autism
.

Thus
,
it
appears
that
the
low
conversion
of
pyridoxal
and
pyridoxine
to
PLP
results
in
low
levels
of
PLP
,
which
is
the
active
cofactor
for
113
known
enzymatic
reactions
,
including
the
formation
of
many
key
neurotransmitters
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
Total
vitamin
B6
is
abnormally
high
in
autism
,
consistent
with
previous
reports
of
an
impaired
pyridoxal
kinase
for
the
conversion
of
pyridoxine
and
pyridoxal
to
PLP
.

This
may
explain
the
many
published
studies
of
benefits
of
high-dose
vitamin
B6
supplementation
in
some
children
and
adults
with
autism
.
Due
to
the
lack
of
tissue
available
for
islet
transplantation
,
new
sources
of
β-cells
have
been
sought
for
the
treatment
of
type
1
diabetes
.

The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
determine
whether
the
human
exocrid
fraction
from
the
islet
isolation
procedure
could
be
reprogrammed
to
provide
additional
islet
tissue
for
transplantation
.

The
exocrine
enriched
cells
rapidly
dedifferentiated
in
culture
and
grew
as
a
mesenchymal
monolayer
.

Genetic
lineage
tracing
confirmed
that
these
mesenchymal
cells
arose
in
part
through
a
process
of
epithelial
to
mesenchymal
transitioning
(
EMT
)
.

A
protocol
was
developed
whereby
transduction
of
these
mesenchymal
cells
with
adenoviruses
containing
Pdx1
,
Ngn3
,
MafA
and
Pax4
generated
a
population
of
cells
that
were
enriched
in
glucagon-secreting
α-like
cells
.

Transdifferentiation
or
reprogramming
towards
insulin
secreting
β-cells
was
enhanced
,
however
,
when
using
unpassaged
cells
in
combination
with
inhibition
of
EMT
by
inclusion
of
ROCK
and
TGF-β1
inhibitors
.

Resultant
cells
were
able
to
secrete
insulin
in
response
to
glucose
and
on
transplantation
,
to
normalise
blood
glucose
levels
in
streptozotocin
diabetic
NOD
/
Scid
mice
.

In
conclusion
,
reprogramming
of
human
exocrine
enriched
tissue
can
best
be
achieved
using
fresh
material
under
conditions
whereby
EMT
is
inhibited
.

Maternal

is
usually

benign
condition
for
the
mother
but
induces
profound

may

The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
investigate
the
protective
effects
in
rat
maternal
and
fetal
livers
as
also
the
placenta
of
melatonin
or
silymarin
against
the
oxidative
stress

induced
by
maternal
obstructive
cholestasis
during

of

)
reduced
OCP-induced
lipid
peroxidation
,
and
prevented
decreases
in
total
glutathione
levels
.

However
,
the
protective
effect
on
OCP-induced
impairment
in
the
GSH
/
GSSG
ratio
was
mild
in
the
placenta
and
fetal
liver
,
while
absent
in
maternal
liver
.

Melatonin
or
silymarin
also
reduced
OCP-induced
signs
of
apoptosis
(
increased
caspase-3
activity
and
Bax-alpha
upregulation
)
in
all
the
organs
assayed
.

Moreover
,
melatonin
(
but
not
silymarin
)
upregulated
several
proteins
involved
in
the
cellular
protection
against
the
oxidative
stress
in
rats
with
OCP
.

These
included
,
biliverdin-IX
alpha
reductase
and
the
sodium-dependent
vitamin
C
transport
proteins
SVCT1
and
SVCT2
,
whose
expression
levels
were
enhanced
in
maternal
and
fetal
liver
by
melatonin
treatment
.

In
contrast
,
in
placenta
only
biliverdin-IX
alpha
reductase
and
SVCT2
were
upregulated
.

These
results
indicate
that
whereas
the
treatment
of
cholestatic
pregnant
rats
with
melatonin
or
silymarin
affords
a
direct
protective
antioxidant
activity
,
only
melatonin
has
dual
beneficial
effects
against
OCP-induced
oxidative
challenge
in
that
it
stimulates
the
expression
of
some
components
of
the
endogenous
cellular
antioxidant

.

One
strategy
to
regain
reactivability
is
to
alkylate
the
phosphylic
adduct
.

Specific
alkylating
molecules
were
synthesized
and
the
crystal
structures
of
the
complexes
they
form
with
soman-aged

butyrylcholinesterase
were
solved
.

Although
the

bind

,
the
orientation
of
the
alkylating
function
appears
to
be
unsuitable
for
efficient
alkylation
of
the
phosphylic
adduct
.

However
,
these
crystal

provide
key
information
to
design
efficient
alkylators

These
properties
suggest
that
creosol-derived
cyanate
esters
may
be
useful
for
a
wide
variety
of
military
and
commercial
applications
.

The
cure
chemistry
of
the
cyanate
esters
has
been
studied
with
FTIR
spectroscopy
and
differential
scanning
calorimetry
.

The
results
show
that
cyanate
esters
with
more
sterically
demanding
bridging
groups
cure
more
slowly
,
but
also
more
completely
than
those
with
a
bridging
methylene
group
.

In
addition
to
the
structural
differences
,
the
purity
of
the
cyanate
esters
has
a
significant
effect
on
both
the
cure
chemistry
and
final
Tg
of
the
materials
.

In
some
cases
,
post-cure
of
the
resins
at
350
°C
resulted
in
significant
decomposition
and
off-gassing
,
but
cure
protocols
that
terminated
at
250-300
°C
generated
void-free
resin
pucks
without
degradation
.

Thermogravimetric
analysis
revealed
that
cured
resins
were
stable
up
to
400
°C
and
then
rapidly
degraded
.

TGA
/
FTIR
and
mass
spectrometry
results
showed
that
the
resins
decomposed
to
phenols
,
isocyanic
acid
,
and
secondary
decomposition
products
,
including
CO2
.

Char
yields
of
cured
resins
under
N2
ranged
from
27
to
35%
,
while
char
yields
in
air
ranged
from
8
to
11%
.

These
data
suggest
that
resins
of
this
type
may
potentially
be
recycled
to
parent
phenols
,
creosol
,
and
other
alkylated
creosols

The
Na
(
+
)
/
Ca
(
2
+
)
exchanger
(
NCX
)
is
a
bidirectional
transporter
that
normally
extrudes
Ca
(
2
+
)
from
the
cell
(
forward
mode
)
,
but
also
brings
Ca
(
2
+
)
into
the
cell
(
reverse
mode
)
under
special
conditions
such
as
intracellular
Na
(
+
)
(
Na
(
+
)
(

)
)
accumulation
or
membrane
depolarization
.

There
are
three
mammalian
NCX
isoforms
:
NCX1
is
widely
expressed
in
the
heart
,
kidney
,
brain
,
blood
vessels
,
and
so
on;
whereas
the
expression
of
NCX2
and
NCX3
is
limited
mainly
to
the
brain
and
skeletal
muscle
.

The
pharmacology
of
NCX
inhibitors
has
been
studied
extensively
since
the
development
of
KB-R7943
,
a
prototype
benzyloxyphenyl
NCX
inhibitor
,
in
1996
.

Currently
,
experiments
are
actively
progressing
with
more
selective
inhibitors
:
SEA0400
,
SN-6
,
and
YM-244769
.

Intriguingly
,
the
inhibitory
potency
of
benzyloxyphenyl
NCX
inhibitors
is
directly
coupled
to
the
rate
of
Na
(
+
)
(
i
)
-dependent
inactivation
.

Therefore
,
the
benzyloxyphenyl
inhibitors
are
apparently
dormant
during
the
forward
mode
under
normal
conditions
(
low
Na
(
+
)
(

)
,
but
become
effective
during
the
reverse
mode
under
pathological
conditions
(
high
Na
(
+
)
(
i
)
)
.

This
should
be
an
ideal
profile
for
calcium
regulators
against
Na

diseases

such
as

,
bepridil
,
aprindine
,
and

,
have
been
found
to
have
an
NCX
inhibitory
action
.

It
is
possible
that
this
property
is
partly
responsible
for
their
antiarrhythmic
and
cardioprotective
effects
.

The

Roles
played
by

function-associated

in
the
regulation
of
lymphocytic
cholinergic
activity
.
GluN2B-containing
NMDA
receptors
are
involved
in
many
important
physiological
functions
and
play
a
pivotal
role
in
mediating
pain
as
well
as
in
several
neurodegenerative
disorders
.

We
aimed
to
develop
fluorescent
probes
to
target
the
GluN2B
subunit
selectively
in
order
to
allow
better
understanding
of
the
relationships
between
receptor
localisation
and
physiological
importance
.

Ifenprodil
,
known
as
the
GluNR2B
antagonist
of
reference
,
was
chosen
as
the
template
for
the
elaboration
of
probes
.

We
had
previously
reported
a
fluorescein
conjugate
that
was
shown
(
by
confocal
microscopy
imaging
of
DS-red-labelled
cortical
neurons
)
to
bind
specifically
to
GluN2B
.

To
elaborate
this
probe
,
we
explored
the
influence
of
both
the
nature
and
the
attachment
point
of
the
spacer
between
the
fluorophore
and
the
parent
compound
,
ifenprodil
.

We
performed
chemical
modifications
of
ifenprodil
at
the
benzylic
position
and
on
the
phenol
ring
by
introducing
secondary
amine
or
amide
functions
and
evaluated
alkyl
chains
from
two
to
20
bonds
either
including
or
not
including
secondary
amide
functions
as
spacers
.

The
previously
developed
probe
was
found
to
display
the
greatest
activity
in
the
inhibition
of
NMDA-induced
Ca
(
2
+
)
influx
by
calcium
imaging
experiments
on
HEK293
cells
transfected
with
the
cDNA
encoding
for
GluN1-1A
and
GluN2B
.

Further
investigations
revealed
that
this
probe
had
a
neuroprotective
effect
equivalent
to
that
of
ifenprodil
in
a
standard
test
for
neurotoxicity
.

Despite
effects
of
lesser
amplitude
with
these
probes
relative
to
ifenprodil
,
we
demonstrated
that
they
displaced
[

ifenprodil
in
mouse
brain
slices
in
a
similar
manner

The
intercalation
pathway
of
lithium
iron
phosphate
(
LFP
)
in
the
positive
electrode
of
a
lithium-ion
battery
was
probed
at
the
∼40
nm
length
scale
using
oxidation-state-sensitive
X-ray
microscopy
.

Combined
with
morphological
observations
of
the
same
exact
locations
using
transmission
electron
microscopy
,
we
quantified
the
local
state-of-charge
of
approximately
450
individual
LFP
particles
over
nearly
the
entire
thickness
of
the
porous
electrode
.

With
the
electrode
charged
to
50%
state-of-charge
in
0
.
5
h
,
we
observed
that
the
overwhelming
majority
of
particles
were
either
almost
completely
delithiated
or
lithiated
.

Specifically
,
only
∼2%
of
individual
particles
were
at
an
intermediate
state-of-charge
.

From
this
small
fraction
of
particles
that
were
actively
undergoing
delithiation
,
we
conclude
that
the
time
needed
to
charge
a
particle
is
∼1
/
50
the
time
needed
to
charge
the
entire
particle
ensemble
.

Surprisingly
,
we
observed
a
very
weak
correlation
between
the
sequence
of
delithiation
and
the
particle
size
,
contrary
to
the
common
expectation
that
smaller
particles
delithiate
before
larger
ones
.

Our
quantitative
results
unambiguously
confirm
the
mosaic
(
particle-by-particle
)
pathway
of
intercalation
and
suggest
that
the
rate-limiting
process
of
charging
is
initiating
the
phase
transformation
by
,
for
example
,
a
nucleation-like
event
.

Therefore
,
strategies
for
further
enhancing
the
performance
of
LFP
electrodes
should
not
focus
on
increasing
the
phase-boundary
velocity
but
on
the
rate
of
phase-transformation
initiation
.

Rheumatoid
arthritis
(
RA
)
and
other
chronic
inflammatory
diseases
are
always
the
major
therapeutic
challenges
.

Recent
research
efforts
provided
new
insights
into
the
molecular
basis
of
these
diseases
and
new
opportunities
for
developing
improved
anti-inflammatory
drugs
.

The
p38
mitogen-activated
protein
(
MAP
)
kinase
plays
a
central
role
in
the
regulation
of
the
biosynthesis
and
release
of
several
proinflammatory
cytokines
including
tumor
necrosis
factor
alpha
(
TNF-α
)
and
interleukin-1
beta
(
IL-1β
)
.

Hence
,
inhibition
of
the
p38
MAP
kinase
is
regarded
as
a
promising
therapeutic
strategy
for
controlling
inflammatory
diseases
.

A
diverse
range
of
p38α
MAP
kinase
inhibitors
have
been
developed
as
potential
anti-inflammatory
agents
,
and
some
of
them
have
entered
the
phase
II
clinical
trials
.

The
imidazole
derivatives
are
known
as
competitive
inhibitors
at
the
ATP
binding
site
of
the
p38α
MAP
kinase
.

Modifications
on
the
imidazole
scaffold
have
led
to
a
large
amount
of
potent
p38α
MAP
kinase
inhibitors
.

This
review
will
summarize
the
developments
of
small
molecule
p38α
MAP
kinase
inhibitors
based
on
the
imidazole
core
scaffolds
in

years
.

positions

introduced
,
and

was
reduced
upon

by
95%

In

showed
that
in
tumors
from

that

Cumulatively
,
our

INTRODUCTION
:
Recent
progress
in
identifying
distinct
subsets
of
lung
cancer
,
based
on
critical
driver
mutations
,
has
led
to
increasingly
focused
efforts
in
the
development
of
selectively
targeted
therapies
.

The
fusion
oncogene
,
echinoderm
microtubule-associated
protein-like
4
-
anaplastic
lymphoma
kinase
(
EML4-ALK
)
,
is
present
in
approximately
5%
of
non-small-cell
lung
cancer
(
NSCLC
)
tumors
.

Crizotinib
is
an
oral
tyrosine
kinase
inhibitor
(
TKI
)
,
which
silences
the
protein
product
of
the
ALK
fusion
gene
and
has
recently
been
approved
for
the
treatment
of
NSCLC
aberrantly
expressing
ALK
.

Emerging
data
suggest
that
crizotinib
may
also
have
activity
in
other
subsets
of
lung
cancer
,
including
tumors
demonstrating
amplification
or
mutation
of
the
MET
oncogene
,
or
translocation
of
the
ROS1
oncogene
.

AREAS
COVERED
:
This
paper
gives
an
overview
of
the
molecular
pathogenesis
of
ALK-associated
NSCLC
.

It
also
reviews
the
pharmacokinetic
and
pharmacodynamic
data
on
crizotinib
and
outlines
the
preclinical
and
clinical
studies
leading
to
the
approval
of
crizotinib
.

In
addition
,
it
discusses
its
role
in
the
treatment
of
NSCLC
expressing
ALK
.

EXPERT
OPINION
:
Crizotinib
represents
the
newest
example
of
a
focused
strategy
for
drug
development
in
lung
cancer
,
based
on
identification
and
targeted
inhibition
of
critical
tumor-specific
driver
mutations
.

Crizotinib
has
demonstrated
efficacy
against
ALK-rearranged
NSCLC
,
and
has
potential
for
broader
application
in
select
subsets
of
lung
cancer
.
Inhibition
of
NF-kappa
B
by
sodium
salicylate
and
aspirin
.
High
expression
of
Cyr61
,
an
extracellular
cysteine-rich
heparin-binding
protein
,
has
been
associated
with
a
malignant
cell
phenotype
and
poor
outcome
in
prostate
cancers
.

Although
Cyr61
was
found
by
us
to
be
overproduced
in
androgen-independent
PC-3
cells
treated
with
N-acetylcysteine
(
NAC
)
,
its
significance
is
still
unclear
.

We
therefore
aimed
to
determine
how
and
why
Cyr61
protein
is
overexpressed
in
NAC-treated
cells
.

Here
,
we
found
that
Cyr61
protein
level
markedly
increased
in
cells
treated
with
NAC
at
high
cell
seeding
density
.

Silencing
of
Cyr61
by
siRNA
induced
enhanced
activity
of
caspase-3
/

,
upregulation
of
the
proapototic
Bok
,
BimL
and
BimS
,
cleavage
of
apoptosis
hallmarkers
such
as
Bax
,
PARP
and
caspase-3
,
and
downregulation
of
antiapoptotic
Bcl2
,
Bcl-xL
and
Mcl-1
proteins
.

NAC
treatment
caused
a
reduction
of
extracellular
medium
pH
to
acidic
and
an
increase
in
Akt
phosphorylation
,
after
which
the
replacement
with
NAC-free
medium
returned
them
to
control
levels
within
24h
.

Acid
stimulation
increased
the
levels
of
Cyr61
and
p-Akt
proteins
,
whereas
it
suppressed
the
induction
of
proapoptotic
and
antiapoptotic
proteins
.

Overall
,
our
data
indicate
that
PC-3
cells
overproduce
Cyr61
protein
via
activation
of
the
PI3K
/
Akt
signaling
as
a
part
of
the
survival
mechanisms
under
the
conditions
causing
extracellular
acidity
and
further
cytotoxicity
.
Phospholipase
D
(
PLD
)
catalyzes
the
hydrolysis
of
the
phosphodiester
bond
of
glycerophospholipid
phosphatidylcholine
to
generate
phosphatidic
acid
(
PA
)
and
choline
.

Phosphatidic
acid
is
widely
considered
to
be
the
intracellular
lipid
mediator
of
many
biological
functions
.

PA
is
a
precursor
of
many
other
bioactive
lipids
,
including
diacylglycerol
(
DAG
)
and
lysophosphatidic
acid
(
LPA
)
.

Phospholipase
D
activities
have
been
described
in
multiple
organisms
,
including
bacteria
,
yeast
,
plants
,
and
mammals
.

In
mammalian
cells
,
PLD
(
PLD1
and
PLD2
isoenzymes
)
has
been
implicated
in
intracellular
signal
transduction
,
vesicle
transport
,
endocytosis
,
exocytosis
,
cell
migration
,
mitosis
,
and
cytoskeletal
reorganization
.

Mammalian
phospholipase
D
is
regulated
by
many
factors
,
including
phosphatidylinositol-4
,
5-bisphosphate
(
PIP2
)
,
protein
kinase
C
(
PKC
)
,
and
small
G-proteins
of
the
Rho
,
Ral
,
and
ARF
families
.

In
this
review
we
discuss
the
relationships
of
PLD1
and
PLD2
,
their
structure
,
biological
function
,
and
implications
in
pathological
states

In
1992
we
described
a
new
syndrome
consisting
of
syncopal
episodes
and
/
or
sudden
death
in
patients
with
a
structurally
normal
heart
and
a
characteristic
electrocardiogram
displaying
a
pattern
resembling
right
bundle
branch
block
with
an
ST
segment
elevation
in
leads
V1
to
V3
.

In
1998
it
was
described
that
the
disease
is
genetically
determined
with
an
autosomal
dominant
pattern
of
transmission
.

Three
different
mutations
have
been
identified
.

All
three
mutations
affect
the
structure
and
the
function
of
the
sodium
channel
SCN5A
.

Two
mutations
result
in
total
loss
of
function
of
the
sodium
channel
.

The
other
mutation
results
in
acceleration
of
the
recovery
of
the
sodium
channel
from
inactivation
.

The
disease
causes
4
to
10
sudden
deaths
per
10
,
000
inhabitants
per
year
in
areas
like
Thailand
and
Laos
.

Up
to
50%
of
the
yearly
sudden
deaths
in
patients
with
a
normal
heart
might
be
caused
by
this
syndrome
.

The
diagnosis
is
easily
made
by
means
of
the
electrocardiogram
(
ECG
)
.

The
presence
of
concealed
and
intermittent
forms
,
however
,
makes
the
diagnosis
difficult
in
some
patients
.

The
ECG
can
be
modulated
by
changes
in
autonomic
balance
and
the
administration
of
antiarrhythmic
drugs
.

Beta-adrenergic
stimulation
normalises

or

accentuate
the
ST

elevation
and
are
capable
of
unmasking

forms
of
the
disease
.

The
prognosis
is
poor
for
patients
who
do
not
receive
an
implantable
cardioverter-defibrillator
.

Entecavir
and

(

exhibit
the
antihepatitis
activities
and
it
is
possible
for
the
two
drugs
to
be
coadministered
in
the
treatment
of
hepatitis
.

We
aimed
to
elucidate
whether
entecavir
was
a
substrate
of
OAT1
,
OAT3
,
OCT
,
and
PEPT1
and
to
investigate
the
targets
of
drug-drug
interactions
between
entecavir
and

.

Plasma
and

concentrations
of
entecavir
following
intravenous
and
oral
administration
in

,
uptake
of
entecavir
in
kidney
slices
and
transfected
cells
in

,
were
determined
by
LC-MS

.

Following

.

However
,
following
oral
co-administration
,
the
entecavir
Tmax
and
Cmax
were
not
affected;
the
degree
of
change
in
other
pharmacokinetic
parameters
(
AUC
,
t1

2β
,
CLP
,
and
accumulated
urinary
excretion
)
was
similar
to
that
of
intravenous
administration
.

The
uptake
of
entecavir
was
nearly
identical
in
hPEPT1-
as
in
vector-HELA
cells
.

In
rat
kidney
slices
,
uptake
of
entecavir
was
markedly
inhibited
by
p-aminohippurate
,
benzylpenicillin
,
JBP485
,
and
tetraethyl
ammonium
.

In
hOAT1-
and
hOAT3-HEK293
cells
,
uptake
of
entecavir
was
significantly
higher
compared
to
vector-HEK293
cells
and
was
markedly
inhibited
by
p-aminohippurate
,

The
enzyme
glutathione
peroxidase
1
(
GPx1
)
is
involved
in
the
cellular
detoxification
of
peroxides
.

To
test
for
the
consequences
of
GPx
deficiency
in
astrocytes
,
astrocyte-rich
primary
cultures
from
wild-type
and
GPx1-deficient
[
GPx1
(
-
/
-
)
]
mice
were
exposed
to
H
(
2
)
O
(
2
)
.

In
GPx1
(
-
/
-
)
astrocytes
,
the
clearance
rate
of
H
(
2
)
O
(
2
)
was
slower
than
in
wild-type
cells
.

In
contrast
to
GPx1-deficient
astrocytes
,
wild-type
cells
exhibited
,
within
2
min
of
H
(
2
)
O
(
2
)
application
,
a
rapid
and
transient
accumulation
of
cellular
glutathione
disulfide
that
amounted
to
60%
of
total
glutathione
.

The
peroxide
treatment
did
not
affect
the
viability
of
wild-type
astrocytes
,
whereas
45%
of
the
GPx1
(
-
/
-
)
cells
died
within
8
hr
.

However
,
the
viability
of
both
types
of
astrocytes
was
strongly
compromised
by
lowering
cellular
glutathione
content
before
peroxide
application
.

In
contrast
,
inactivation
of
catalase
caused
substantial
cell
death
only
in
GPx1
(
-
/
-
)
cells
but
not
in
wild-type
astrocytes
.

The
cell
death
observed
was
prevented
by
the
iron
chelators
deferoxamine
,
1
,
10-phenathroline
,
or
2
,
2'-dipyridyl
,
whereas
preincubation
with
ferric
ammonium
citrate
increased
the
toxicity
of
peroxide
treatments
.

These
results
demonstrate
that
GPx1
contributes
to
the
rapid
clearance
of
H
(
2
)
O
(
2
)
by
mouse
astrocytes
and
that
both
GPx1
and
a
high
concentration
of
glutathione
are
required
to
protect
these
cells
from
iron-dependent
peroxide
damage

The
neuropeptide
oxytocin
has
emerged
as
an
important
anorexigen
in
the
regulation
of
energy
balance
.

Its
effects
on
food
intake
have
largely
been
attributed
to
limiting
meal
size
through
interactions
in
key
regulatory
brain
regions
such
as
the
hypothalamus
and
hindbrain
.

Pharmacologic
and
pair-feeding
studies
indicate
that
its
ability
to
reduce
body
mass
extends
beyond
that
of
food
intake
,
affecting
multiple
factors
that
determine
energy
balance
such
as
energy
expenditure
,
lipolysis
,
and
glucose
regulation
.

Systemic
administration
of
oxytocin
recapitulates
many
of
its
effects
when
administered
centrally
,
raising
the
questions
of
whether
and
to
what
extent
circulating
oxytocin
contributes
to
energy
regulation
.

Its
therapeutic
potential
to
treat
metabolic
conditions
remains
to
be
determined
,
but
data
from
diet-induced
and
genetically
obese
rodent
models
as
well
as
application
of
oxytocin
in
humans
in
other
areas
of
research
have
revealed
promising
results
thus
far
.
Regulation
of
sexual
reproduction
by
estradiol
involves
the
activation
of
estrogen
receptors
(
ERs
)
in
the
hypothalamus
.

Of
the
two
classical
ERs
involved
in
reproduction
,
ERα
appears
to
be
the
critical
isoform
.

The
role
of
ERα
in
reproduction
has
been
found
to
involve
a
nuclear
ERα
that
induces
a
genomic
mechanism
of
action
.

More
recently
,
a
plasma
membrane
ERα
has
been
shown
to
trigger
signaling
pathways
involved
in
reproduction
.

Mechanisms
underlying
membrane-initiated
estradiol
signaling
are
emerging
,
including
evidence
that
activation
of
plasma
membrane
ERα
involves
receptor
trafficking
.

The
present
study
examined
the
insertion
of
ERα
into
the
plasma
membrane
of
N-38
neurons
,
an
immortalized
murine
hypothalamic
cell
line
.

We
identified
,
using
western
blotting
and
PCR
that
N-38
neurons
express
full-length
66kDa
ERα
and
a
52kDa
ERα
spliced
variant
missing
the
fourth
exon
-
ERαΔ4
.

Using
surface
biotinylation
,
we
observed
that
treatment
of
N-38
neurons
with
estradiol
or
with
a
membrane
impermeant
estradiol
elevated
plasma
membrane
ERα
protein
levels
,
indicating
that
membrane
signaling
increased
receptor
insertion
into
the
cell
membrane
.

Insertion
of
ERα
was
blocked
by
the
ER
antagonist
ICI
182
,
780
or
with
the
protein
kinase
C
(
PKC
)
pathway
inhibitor
bisindolylmaleimide
(
BIS
)
.

Downstream
membrane-initiated
signaling
was
confirmed
by
estradiol
activation
of
PKC-theta
(
PKCθ
)
and
the
release
of
intracellular
calcium
.

These
results
indicate
that
membrane
ERα
levels
in
N-38
neurons
are
dynamically
autoregulated
by
estradiol
.
OBJECTIVE
:
To

the
pharmacology
,
pharmacokinetics
,
safety
,
and
efficacy
of
albiglutide
,
a
glucagon-like
peptide-1
receptor
agonist
(

)
in

(

)
.

DATA
SOURCES
:
A
MEDLINE
search
(
1950-June
2014
)
was
conducted
using
the
keyword
albiglutide
.

References
were
reviewed
to
identify
additional
sources
.

STUDY
SELECTION
AND
DATA
EXTRACTION
:
Articles
evaluating
pharmacokinetics
,
pharmacodynamics
,
safety
,
or
efficacy
of
albiglutide
were
included
.

DATA
SYNTHESIS
:
Albiglutide
is
a
long-acting
GLP-1
RA
that
lowers
glycosylated
hemoglobin
(
A1C
)
and
reduces
weight
by
stimulating
glucose-dependent
insulin
secretion
,
suppressing
glucagon
secretion
,
delaying
gastric
emptying
,
and
promoting
satiety
.

Albiglutide
has
a
long
half-life
as
a
result
of
resistance
to
degradation
by
dipeptidyl
peptidase-4
and
fusion
to
albumin
,
thus
allowing
once-weekly
dosing
.

Albiglutide
has
been
studied
as
monotherapy
and
add-on
therapy
to
metformin
,
sulfonylureas
,
thiazolidinediones
,
insulin
glargine
,
and
varying
combinations
of
these
agents
.

Clinical
studies
have
shown
albiglutide
to
be
superior
to
placebo
,
sitagliptin
,

Sulfasalazine
is
widely
used
in
rheumatoid
arthritis
and
inflammatory
bowel
diseases
.

The
mechanisms
of
its
activity
have
not
been
elucidated
.

In
leukocytes
,
sulfasalazine
and
its
analogue
,
CL
42A
,
inhibited
the
formation
of
leukotrienes
and
possibly
of
the
second
messenger
compounds
at
the
level
of
phospholipase
C
.

Partial
inhibition
of
interleukin-lbeta
(
IL-1beta
)
,
IL-6
and
tumor
necrosis
factor-alpha
(
TNF-alpha
)
was
also
found
.

Since
the
synthesis
of
eicosanoids
is
induced
by
phospholipase
A2
and
since
secretory
phospholipase
A2
(
sPLA2
)
is
proinflammatory
,
we
investigated
the
impact
of
sulfasalazine
and
related
compounds
on
mRNA
,
protein
synthesis
,
and
release
of
sPLA2
from
osteoblasts
.

Sulfasalazine
and
CL
42A
markedly
inhibited
extracellular
release
of
sPLA2
.

The
impact
of
sulfasalazine
was
evident
at
50
microM
(
P
<
0
.
001
)
and
maximal
at
400
microM
,
and
that
of
CL
42A
at
10
microM
(
P
<
0
.
001
)
and
200
microM
,
respectively
.

Split
products
of
sulfasalazine
,
5-aminosalicylic
acid
(
400
microM
)
and
sulfapyridine
(
400
microM
)
,
had
no
impact
.

The
effect
of
sulfasalazine
and
CL
42A
was
evident
regardless
of
whether
the
cells
were
stimulated
with
IL-1beta
/
TNF-alpha
,
lipopolysaccharide
/
forskolin
,
or
dibutyryl-cAMP
.

Sulfasalazine
and
CL
42A
did
not
alter
the
level
of
sPLA2
mRNA
.

Exposure
of
stimulated
fetal
rat
calvaria
osteoblasts
(
FRCO
)
to
sulfasalazine
did
not
show
accumulation
of
the
intracellular
sPLA2
protein
as
tested
by
western
blot;
however
,
enzymatic
activity
of
PLA2
in
disrupted
cells
was
definitely
increased
.

Thus
,
the
impact
is
on
the
post-transcriptional
release
of
sPLA2
rather
than
on
the
synthesis
.

There
was
also
an
increase
in
the
extracellular
release
of
prostaglandin
E2
from
FRCO
exposed
to
sulfasalazine
or
to
CL
42A
.

In
contrast
,
sulfasalazine
had
no
effect
on
the
extracellular
release
of
gelatinase
from
the
cells
or
on
mRNA
of
cytosolic
PLA2
or
cyclooxygenase
2
.

We
conclude
that
the
anti-inflammatory
activity
of
sulfasalazine
may
be
related
,
in
part
,
to
the
selective
inhibition
of
the
extracellular
release
of
proinflammatory
sPLA2
.

to
the
control

In
the

,
we
investigated
the
regulation

intercellular

(
GJIC
)
during
the
AhR-dependent
disruption

in

.

The
contact
inhibition
of
cell
proliferation
is
a
process
restricting
the
cell
division
of
confluent
non-transformed
cells
,
which
is
frequently
abolished
in

however
,
the
mechanisms
contributing
to
its
disruption
are
still
only
partially
understood
.

possibly
via

,
significantly
decreased
the
amount
of

and
downregulated
GJIC
,
in
an
AhR-dependent
manner
.

Although
both
intracellular
and
membrane
Cx43
pools
were
markedly
reduced
in
cells
released
from
contact
inhibition
by
TCDD
,
siRNA-mediated
Cx43
knock-down
was
not
sufficient
to
stimulate
proliferation
in
contact-inhibited
cells
.

Our
data
suggest
that
downregulation
of
Cx43
/
GJIC
in
non-transformed
epithelial
cells
is
an
inherent
part
of
disruption
of
contact
inhibition
,
which
occurs
at
the
post-transcriptional
level
.

This
process
runs
in
parallel
with
alterations
of
other
forms
of

thus
suggesting
that
toxic
AhR
agonists
may
simultaneously
abrogate

RATIONALE
:
Both
the
acute
and
chronic
consumption
of
ethanol
have
been
reported
to
modify
several
molecular
events
in
the
central
nervous
system
,
and
the
endogenous
μ-opioid
receptor
system
is
involved
in
the
reinforcing
/
rewarding
effects
of
ethanol
.

OBJECTIVES
:
The
present
study
was
designed
to
clarify
the
effects
of
chronic
ethanol
treatment
on
cellular
processes
involving
μ-opioid
receptor
and
the
development
of
morphine-induced
rewarding
effects
.

METHODS
:
Male
C57BL

6J
mice
were
continuously
treated
with
a
liquid
diet
containing
3
.
0
w
/
v
ethanol
.

The
direct
involvement
of
μ-opioid
receptor
functions
in
the
activation
of
G-proteins
and
changes
in
protein
levels
in
the
lower
midbrain
of
mice
after
chronic
treatment
with
ethanol
were
investigated
by
a
[
(
35
)
S
]
GTPγS
binding
assay
and
Western
blotting
,
respectively
.

The
rewarding
effects
of
morphine
(
5
mg
/
kg
)
under
treatment
with
ethanol
were
measured
by
the
conditioned
place
preference
paradigm
.

RESULTS
:
The
function
of
μ-opioid
receptor
was
increased
by
treatment
with
ethanol
in
the
lower
midbrain
using
[
(
35
)
S
]
GTPγS
binding
assay
.

Furthermore
,
the
GRK2
protein
level
was
significantly
increased
by
treatment
with
ethanol
.

Chronic
treatment
with
ethanol
enhanced
the
rewarding
effects
of
morphine
.

On
the
other
hand
,
this
enhancement
of
the
rewarding
effects
of
morphine
by
ethanol
treatment
was
significantly
inhibited
by
the
GRK2
inhibitor

.

CONCLUSIONS
:
The
present
study
demonstrated
that
chronic
treatment
with
ethanol
enhanced
the
rewarding
effects
of
morphine
by
up-regulating
functional
changes
in
μ-opioid

are
observed

.

To
determine
the
possible
interaction
between
these
changes
,
we
investigated
the
effect
of
NCX
overexpression
on
responses
to
isoproterenol
in
adult
rat
ventricular
myocytes
.

Responses
to
isoproterenol
were
largely
mediated
through
the
beta1AR
in
control
myocytes
.

Adenovirally-mediated
overexpression
of
NCX
,
at
levels
,
which
did
not
alter
basal
contraction
of
myocytes
,
markedly
depressed
the
isoproterenol
concentration-response
curve
.

Responses
to
isoproterenol
could
be
restored
to
normal
by
beta2AR
blockade
,
suggesting
a
beta2AR-mediated
inhibition
of
beta1AR
signalling
.

Pertussis
toxin
normalised
isoproterenol
responses
in
NCX
cells
,
indicating
that
beta2AR
effects
were
mediated
by
Gi
.

,
551
,
previously
shown
to
be
due
to
beta2AR-Gi
coupling
,
were
increased
in
NCX
cells
.

We
conclude
that
NCX
upregulation
can
markedly
alter
the
consequences
of
betaAR
stimulation
and
that
this
may
contribute
to
the
alterations
in
betaAR
response
seen
in
failing
human
heart
.
We
investigated
whether
selective
beta
(
1
)
-adrenoceptor
stimulation
causes
hypertrophic
growth
on
isolated
ventricular
cardiomyocytes
from
adult
rat
.

As
parameters
for
the
induction
of
hypertrophic
growth
,
the
increases
of
[
(
14
)
C
]
phenylalanine
incorporation
,
protein
and
RNA
mass
,
and
cell
size
were
determined
.

Isoproterenol
(
Iso
,
10
microM
)
alone
had
no
growth
effect
.

In
the
presence
of
the
beta
(
2
)
-adrenoceptor
antagonist
ICI-118551
(
ICI
,
10
microM
)
,
Iso
caused
an
increase
in
[
(
14
)
C
]
phenylalanine
incorporation
,
protein
and
RNA
mass
,
cell
volume
,
and
cross-sectional
area
.

We
showed
for
phenylalanine
incorporation
that
the
growth
effect
of
Iso
+
ICI
could
be
antagonized
by
beta
(
1
)
-adrenoceptor
blockade
with
atenolol
(
10
microM
)
or
metoprolol
(
10
microM
)
,
indicating
that
it
was
caused
by
selective
beta
(
1
)
-adrenoceptor
stimulation
.

The
growth
response
to
Iso
+
ICI
was
accompanied
by
an
increase
in
ornithine
decarboxylase
(
ODC
)
activity
and
expression
.

Inhibition
of
ODC
by
the
ODC
antagonist
difluoromethylornithine
(
1
mM
)
attenuated
this
hypertrophic
response
,
indicating
that
ODC
induction
is
causally
involved
.

The
growth
response
to
Iso
+
ICI
was
found
to
be
cAMP
independent
but
was
sensitive
to
genistein
(
100
microM
)
or
rapamycin
(
0

1
microM
)
.

The
reaction
was
enhanced
in
the
presence
of
pertussis
toxin
(
10
microM
)
.

We
conclude
that
selective
beta
(
1
)
-adrenoceptor
stimulation
causes
hypertrophic
growth
of
ventricular
cardiomyocytes
by
a
mechanism
that
is
independent
of
cAMP
but
dependent
on
a
tyrosine
kinase
and
ODC
.

In
the
present

,
8-hydroxycalamenene
was
isolated
from
the
hexane
fraction
of
Reynoutria
elliptica
.

We
showed
that
8-hydroxycalamenene
attenuated
the
cell
death
of
transformed
RGC-5
cells
.

This
compound
also
produced
a

)

Moreover
,
the
addition
of
8-hydroxycalamenene
to

cultures
restored
the
reduced

potential
resulting
from

.

The

affected
the
thickness
of

and
increased
the
number
of
TUNEL-positive

.

However
,
8-hydroxycalamenene
protected
against
thinning
of
the
IPL
and
reduced
TUNEL-positive

in
the
ganglion

layer
.

Increasing

Hyperphenylalaninemia
,
which
can
cause
neurological
disorders
and
mental
retardation
,
results
from
a
mutation
in
phenylalanine
hydroxylase
or
an
enzyme
required
for
biosynthesis
or
regeneration
of
its
cofactor
,
tetrahydrobiopterin
.

The
hyperphenylalaninemia
variant
primapterinuria
is
characterized
by
the
excretion
of
7-biopterin
(
primapterin
)
.

This
disorder
is
thought
to
be
due
to
a
deficiency
of
4a-hydroxy-tetrahydrobiopterin
dehydratase
(
pterin-4a-carbinolamine
dehydratase
)
,
but
a
lack
of
tissue
activity
has
not
been
directly
demonstrated
.

The
five
mutations
so
far
recognized
in
patients
with
primapterinuria
are
associated
with
either
a
single
amino
acid
change
or
a
premature
stop
codon
.

Only
C81R
has
been
successfully
expressed
in
soluble
form
,
and
was
found
to
have
40%
of
normal
activity
.

Tissues
which
could
be
obtained
by
minimally
invasive
procedures
were
analyzed
for
dehydratase
activity
.

None
was
detected
in
normal
human
white
cells
or
fibroblasts
.

However
,
activity
was
found
in
intestine
of
rat
,
dog
,
pig
,
and
particularly
humans
where
it
was
only
eight
times
lower
than
in
liver
.

Distribution
along
the
length
and
across
the
wall
of
small
intestine
was
relatively
uniform
.

Moreover
,
the
dehydratases
from
human
liver
and
intestinal
mucosa
have
identical
kinetic
properties
.

A
biopsy
of
duodenal
mucosa
from
a
patient
with
homozygous
E96K
dehydratase
had
activity
of
55
nmol
.

min

mucosa
compared
to

nmol
.

min
(
-1
)
g
(
-1
)
tissue
in
controls
(
n
=
12
)
.

The
sixfold
lower
tissue
activity
of
the
E96K
mutant
alone
may
not
be
sufficient
to
account
for
the
biochemical
symptoms
of
primapterinuria
in
this
patient
.

However
,
accumulation
of
a
4a-hydroxy-tetrahydrobiopterin
degradation
product
(
a
side-chain
cyclic
adduct
)
,
which
has
been
observed
in
vitro
and
appears
to
be
a
dehydratase
inhibitor
,
may
further
exacerbate
the
problem
.
Apomorphine
,
the
catechol-derived
dopamine
D1
/
D2
receptor
agonist
,
is
currently
in
use
as
an
antiparkinsonian
drug
.

It
has
previously
been
reported
that
apomorphine
was
able
to
elicit
expression
of
the
enzyme
tyrosine
hydroxylase
,
a
marker
for
DA
neurons
,
in
the
fetal
rat
cerebrocortical
cultures
whilst
in
the
presence
of
brain-derived
neurotrophic
factor
.

The
present
study
demonstrated
that
treatment
of
fetal
rat
ventral
mesencephalic
cultures
with
apomorphine
caused
a
marked
increase
in
the
number
of
dopaminergic
neurons
.

The
action
of
apomorphine
can
be
mimicked
by
dopamine
receptor
(
D1
and
D2
)
agonists
or
blocked
by
preincubation
with
D1
/
D2
receptor
antagonists
.

Incubation
of
recipient
mesencephalic
cultures
with
the
conditioned
medium
derived
from
apomorphine-stimulated
donor
mesencephalic
cultures
elicited
a
3
.
72-fold
increase
in
the
number
of
TH-positive
neurons
.

Increased
mRNA
expression
levels
of
brain-derived
neurotrophic
factor
and
glial
cell
line-derived
neurotrophic
factor
were
also
found
in
the
apomorphine-treated
mesencephalic
cells
along
with
concomitant
protein
expression
increases
in
the
conditioned
medium
.

Moreover
,
the
trophic
activity
observed
could
be
partially
neutralized
by
antibodies
against
either
brain-derived
neurotrophic
factor
or
glial
cell
line-derived
neurotrophic
factor
.

Cultured
fetal
striatal
cells
,
but
not
hippocampal
cells
,
also
responded
to
apomorphine
treatment
.

The
membrane
filtration
studies
revealed
that
both
<30
kDa
and
>50
kDa
fractions
contained
trophic
activities
.

The
latter
characterization
distinguishes
them
from
most
known
neurotrophic
factors
.

These
results
suggest
that
the
apomorphine-modulated
development
of
dopaminergic
neurons
may
be
mediated
by
activation
of
the
dopamine
receptor
subtypes
D1
and
D2
thereby
increasing
the
production
of
multiple

Aim
:
A
number
of
studies
have
demonstrated
that
ABCB1
and
BCRP
(
ABCG2
)
actively
transport
Aβ
.

We
aimed
to
investigate
the
association
of
genetic
variants
of
selected
multidrug
transporters
with
Alzheimer's
disease
(
AD
)
in
histopathologically
confirmed
AD
cases
and
controls
.

Materials
&
methods
:

was

,
ABCB1
,
ABCC2
and
ABCG2
.

In
addition
,
the
APOE4
status
was
analyzed
.

Results
:
The
novel
ABCA7
SNP
,
rs3752246
,
tended
to
be
associated
with
AD
in
our
study
.

Variants
in
ABCB1
were
significantly
less
frequent
in
AD
cases
older
than
65
years
of
age
and
among
females
.

This
association
of
ABCB1
2677G>T
(
rs2032582
)
was
more
pronounced
in
APOE4-negative
cases
(
p
=
0
.
005
)
.

However
,
only
ABCC2
3972C>T
(
rs3740066
)
was
significantly
associated
with
AD
risk
after
logistic
regression
analysis
including
all
variants
.

Other
transporters
showed
a
lack
of
association
.

Conclusion
:
Our
results
support
the
hypothesis
that
ABCB1
and
possibly
other
ABC-transporters
are
involved
in
the
process
of
Aβ
accumulation
in
the
aging
brain
and
may
modulate
the
risk
for
AD
in
an
allele-specific
manner
,
and
thus
might
represent
a
new
target
for
prevention
and
treatment
of
AD
.

Androgen
insensitivity
syndrome
(
AIS
)
is
a
disorder
caused
by
a
mutation
of
the
gene
encoding
the
androgen
receptor
(
AR;
Xq11-q12
)
.

The
prevalence
of
AIS
has
been
estimated
to
be
one
case
in
every
20
,
000
to
64
,
000
newborn
males
for
the
complete
syndrome
(
CAIS
)
,
and
the
prevalence
is
unknown
for
the
partial
syndrome
(
PAIS
)
.

The
symptoms
range
from
phenotypically
normal
males
with
impaired
spermatogenesis
to
phenotypically
normal
women
with
primary
amenorrhea
.

Various
forms
of
ambiguous
genitalia
have
been
observed
at
birth
.

The
diagnosis
is
confirmed
by
determining
the
exact
mutation
in
the
AR
gene
.

PAIS
individuals
require
precise
diagnosis
as
early
as
possible
so
that
the
sex
can
be
assigned
,
treatment
can
be
recommended
,
and
they
can
receive
proper
genetic
counseling
.

After
birth
,
differential
diagnosis
should
be
performed
using
other
forms
of
abnormal
sexual
differentiation
of
primary
amenorrhea
.

The
treatment
of
AIS
is
based
on
reinforcement
sexual
identity
,
gonadectomy
planning
,
and
hormone
replacement
therapy
.

The
prognosis
for
CAIS
is
good
if
the
testicular
tissue
is
removed
at
the
appropriate
time
.

For
PAIS
,
the
prognosis
depends
on
the
ambiguity
of
the
genitalia
and
physical
and
psychosocial
adjustment
to
the
assigned
sex
.
Primary
carnitine
deficiency
is
an
autosomal
recessive
disorder
of
fatty
acid
oxidation
characterized
by
hypoketotic
hypoglycemia
and
skeletal
and
cardiac
myopathy
.

It
is
caused
by
mutations
in
the
Na
+
-dependent
organic
cation
transporter
,
OCTN2
.

To
define
the
domains
involved
in
carnitine
recognition
,
we
evaluated
chimeric
transporters
created
by
swapping
homologous
domains
between
OCTN1
,
which
does
not
transport
carnitine
,
and
OCTN2
.

Substitution
of
the
C
terminus
of
OCTN2
(
amino
acid
residues
342-557
)
with
the
corresponding
residues
of
OCTN1
completely
abolished
carnitine
transport
.

The
progressive
substitution
of
the
N
terminus
of
OCTN2
with
OCTN1
resulted
in
a
decrease
in
carnitine
transport
associated
with
a
progressive
increase
in
the
Km
toward
carnitine
from
3
.
9
+
/
-
0
.
5
to
141
+
/
-

microM
.

The
largest
drop
in
carnitine
transport
(
and
increase
in
Km
toward
carnitine
)
was
observed
with
the
substitution
of
residues
341-454
of
OCTN2
.

An
additional
chimeric
transporter
(
CHIM-9
)
in
which
only
residues
341-454
of
OCTN2
were
substituted
by
OCTN1
had
markedly
reduced
carnitine
transport
,
with
an
elevated
Km
toward
carnitine
(
63
+
/
-
5
microM
)
.

Site-directed
mutagenesis
and
introduction
of
residues
nonconserved
between
OCTN1
and
OCTN2
in
the
OCTN2
cDNA
indicated
that
the
R341A
,
L409W
,
L424Y
,
and
T429I
substitutions
significantly
decreased
carnitine
transport
.

Single
substitutions
did
not
increase
the
Km
toward
carnitine
.

By
contrast
,
the
combination
of
three
of
these
substitutions
(
R341W
+
L409W
+
T429I
)
greatly
decreased
carnitine
transport
and
increased
the
Km
toward
carnitine
(
20
.
2
+
/
-
4
.
5
microm
)
.

The
Arg-341
,
Leu-409
,
and
Thr-429
residues
are
all
located
in
predicted
transmembrane
domains
.

Involvement
of
these
residues
in
carnitine
transport
was
further
supported
by
the
partial
restoration
of
carnitine
transport
by
the
introduction
of
these
OCTN2
residues
in
the
OCTN1
portion
of
CHIM-9
.

These
studies
indicate
that
multiple
domains
of
the
OCTN2
transporter
are
required
for
carnitine
transport
and
identify
transmembrane
residues
important
for
carnitine
recognition
.
The
neuronal
vesicular
monoamine
transporter
(
VMAT2
)
is
the
target
molecule
of
action
of
some
psychostimulants
,
such
as
methamphetamine
and
3
,
4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine
(
MDMA
)
.

The
present
study
examined
the
effect
of
antidepressants
,
such
as
selective
serotonin
reuptake
inhibitors
(
SSRIs
)
,
on
VMAT2
activity
by
measuring
adenosine
triphosphate-dependent
[
(
3
)
H
]
dopamine
uptake
into
synaptic
vesicles
prepared
from
rat
striatum
.

SSRIs
,
fluoxetine
,
paroxetine
,
and
fluvoxamine
,
inhibited
vesicular
[
(
3
)
H
]
dopamine
uptake
in
vitro
.

The
rank
order
of
potency
was
reserpine>>fluoxetine
,
paroxetine>fluvoxamine
,
methamphetamine>MDMA
.

Moreover
,
kinetic
analysis
revealed
that
inhibition
by
reserpine
,
a
typical
VMAT2
inhibitor
,
was
uncompetitive
,
decreasing
maximum
velocity
and
affinity
for
dopamine
.

Inhibition
by
fluoxetine
was
noncompetitive
,
only
decreasing
maximum
velocity
for
dopamine
.

These
results
suggest
that
fluoxetine
inhibited
the
activity
of
VMAT2
by
a
mechanism
different
from
that
of
reserpine
and
did
not
directly
interact
with
the
active
site
of
VMAT2
.

Although
it
is
chemically
a
classical
tricyclic
antidepressant
agent
,
trimipramine
shows
atypical
pharmacological
properties
.

Its
well-documented
antidepressant
action
cannot
be
explained
by
noradrenaline
or
serotonin
reuptake
inhibition
or
by
a
down-regulation
of
beta-adrenoceptors
.

Furthermore
,
its
receptor
affinity
profile
resembles
more
that
of
clozapine
,
a
neuroleptic
drug
,
than
that
of
tricyclic
antidepressants
.

Trimipramine
does
not
reduce
,
but
rather
increases
,
rapid
eye
movement
sleep
.

It
stimulates
nocturnal
prolactin
secretion
and
inhibits
nocturnal
cortisol
secretion
and
may
act
at
the
level
of
the
hypothalamus
on
corticotropin-releasing
hormone
secretion
.

Trimipramine
is
of
particular
value
in
depressed
patients
with
insomnia
,
and
it
has
been
shown
to
be
effective
in
the
therapy
of
primary
insomnia
.

As
the
pharmacological
profile
indicates
,
and
an
open
clinical
study
has
shown
,
trimipramine
might
also
be
active
as
an
antipsychotic
.

The
drug
is
both
a
tool
for
increasing
our
understanding
of
depression
and
a
potential
therapy
for
several
psychiatric
disorders
.

BACKGROUND
:
Endothelial
dysfunction
because
of
reduced
nitric
oxide
bioavailability
is
a
key
feature
of
essential
hypertension
.

We
have
found
that
normotensive
siblings
of
subjects
with
essential
hypertension
have
impaired
endothelial
function
accompanied
by
altered
arginine
metabolism
.

METHODS
AND
RESULTS
:
We
have
identified
a
novel

polymorphism
in
the
3'UTR
of
the

)
.

The
minor
T
allele
significantly
attenuates
reporter

expression
(

)
and
is
impaired
in
its
capacity
to
form
DNA-protein
complexes
(
P<0

)
.

In

hypertensive
subjects
the
frequency
of
the

was

3%
compared
with
7

6%
in
498
normotensive

Moreover
,
the
overall
genotype

observed
in
hypertensives
differed
significantly
from
that
in
normotensives
(

.

To
complement
these
studies
,

CONCLUSIONS
:
The
present
study
identifies
a
key
,
functionally
active
polymorphism
in
the
3'UTR
of
SLC7A1
.

As
such
,
this
polymorphism
may
account
for
the
apparent
link
between
altered
endothelial
function
,
L-arginine
,
and
nitric
oxide
metabolism
and
predisposition
to
essential
hypertension
.
A
potential
adverse
effect
of
cyclo-oxygenase
(
COX
)
inhibitors
(
nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory
drugs
[
NSAIDs
]
)
in
horses
is
colitis
.

In
addition
,
we
have
previously
shown
an
important
role
for
COX-produced
prostanoids
in
recovery
of
ischaemic-injured
equine
jejunum
.

It
was
hypothesised
that
the
nonselective
COX
inhibitor
flunixin
would
retard
repair
of
bile-injured
colon
by
preventing
production
of
reparative
prostaglandins
,
whereas
the
selective
COX-2
inhibitor
,
etodolac
would
not
inhibit
repair
as
a
result
of
continued
COX-1
activity
.

Segments
of
the
pelvic
flexure
were
exposed
to
1
.
5
mmol
/
l
deoxycholate
for
30
min
,
after
which
they
were
recovered
for
4
h
in
Ussing
chambers
.

Contrary
to
the
proposed
hypothesis
,
recovery
of
bile-injured
colonic
mucosa
was
not
affected
by
flunixin
or
etodolac
,
despite
significantly
depressed
prostanoid
production
.

However
,
treatment
of
control
tissue
with
flunixin
led
to
increases
in
mucosal
permeability
,
whereas
treatment
with
etodolac
had
no
significant
effect
.

Therefore
,
although
recovery
from
bile-induced
colonic
injury
maybe
independent
of
COX-elaborated
prostanoids
,
treatment
of
control
tissues
with
nonselective
COX
inhibitors
may
lead
to
marked
increases
in
permeability
.

Alternatively
,
selective
inhibition
of
COX-2
may
reduce
the
incidence
of
adverse
effects
in
horses
requiring
NSAID
therapy
.

Escitalopram
oxalate
(
S-citalopram
,
Lexapro
)
,
a
selective
serotonin
re-uptake
inhibitor
antidepressant
which
is
the
S-enantiomer
of
citalopram
,
is
in
clinical
development
worldwide
for
the
treatment
of
depression
and
anxiety
disorders
.

Preclinical
studies
demonstrate
that
the
therapeutic
activity
of
citalopram
resides
in
the
S-isomer
and
that
escitalopram
binds
with
high
affinity
to
the
human
serotonin
transporter
.

Conversely
,
R-citalopram
is
approximately
30-fold
less
potent
than
escitalopram
at
this
transporter
.

Escitalopram
has
linear
pharmacokinetics
,
so
that
plasma
levels
increase
proportionately
and
predictably
with
increased
doses
and
its
half-life
of
27
-
32
h
is
consistent
with
once-daily
dosing
.

In
addition
,
escitalopram
has
negligible
effects
on
cytochrome
P450
drug-metabolising
enzymes
in
vitro
,
suggesting
a
low
potential
for
drug-drug
interactions
.

The
efficacy
of
escitalopram
in
patients
with
major
depressive
disorder
has
been
demonstrated
in
multiple
short-term
,
placebo-controlled
clinical
trials
,
three
of
which
included
citalopram
as
an
active
control
,
as
well
as
in
a
36-week
study
evaluating
efficacy
in
the
prevention
of
depression
relapse
.

In
these
studies
,
escitalopram
was
shown
to
have
robust
efficacy
in
the
treatment
of
depression
and
associated
symptoms
of
anxiety
relative
to
placebo
.

Efficacy
has
also
been
shown
in
treating
generalised
anxiety
disorder
,
panic
disorder
and
social
anxiety
disorder
.

Results
also
suggest
that
,
at
comparable
doses
,
escitalopram
demonstrates
clinically
relevant
and
statistically
significant
superiority
to
placebo
treatment
earlier
than
citalopram
.

Analysis
of
the
safety
database
shows
a
low
rate
of
discontinuation
due
to
adverse
events
,
and
there
was
no
statistically
significant
difference
between
escitalopram
10
mg
/
day
and
placebo
in
the
proportion
of
patients
who
discontinued
treatment
early
because
of
adverse
events
.

The
most
common
adverse
events
associated
with
escitalopram
which
occurred
at
a
rate
greater
than
placebo
include
nausea
,
insomnia
,
ejaculation
disorder
,
diarrhoea
,
dry
mouth
and
somnolence
.

Only
nausea
occurred
in
>
10%
of
escitalopram-treated
patients
.
Due
to
the
increased
prevalence
of
bacterial
strains
that
are
resistant
to
existing
antibiotics
,
there
is
an
urgent
need
for
new
antibacterial
strategies
.

Bacterial
glycans
are
an
attractive
target
for
new
treatments
,
as
they
are
frequently
linked
to
pathogenesis
and
contain
distinctive
structures
that
are
absent
in
humans
.

We
set
out
to
develop
a
novel
targeting
strategy
based
on
surface
glycans
present
on
the
gastric
pathogen
Helicobacter
pylori
(
Hp
)
.

In
this
study
,
metabolic
labeling
of
bacterial
glycans
with
an
azide-containing
sugar
allowed
selective
delivery
of
immune
stimulants
to
azide-covered
Hp
.

We
established
that
Hp's
surface
glycans
are
labeled
by
treatment
with
the
metabolic
substrate
peracetylated
N-azidoacetylglucosamine
(
Ac4
GlcNAz
)
.

By
contrast
,
mammalian
cells
treated
with
Ac4
GlcNAz
exhibited
no
incorporation
of
the
chemical
label
within
extracellular
glycans
.

We
further
demonstrated
that
the
Staudinger
ligation
between
azides
and
phosphines
proceeds
under
acidic
conditions
with
only
a
small
loss
of
efficiency
.

We
then
targeted
azide-covered
Hp
with
phosphines
conjugated
to
the
immune
stimulant
2
,
4-dinitrophenyl
(
DNP
)
,
a
compound
capable
of
directing
a
host
immune
response
against
these
cells
.

Finally
,
we
report
that
immune
effector
cells
catalyze
selective
damage
in
vitro
to
DNP-covered
Hp
in
the
presence
of
anti-DNP
antibodies
.

The
technology
reported
herein
represents
a
novel
strategy
to
target
Hp
based
on
its
glycans
.
Under
the
assumption
that
field
potentials
recorded
from
particular
brain
areas
reflect
the
net
balance
of
neurotransmitter
activities
,
the
dose-
and
time-dependent
responses
induced
by
intraperitoneal
application
of
different
neuroleptic
drugs
are
quantified
by
spectral
analysis
of
the
electroencephalogram
recorded
from
frontal
cortex
,
hippocampus
,
striatum
and
reticular
formation
.

The
actions
of
haloperidol
,
chlorpromazine
,
clozapine
,
prothipendyl
and
thioridazine
in
general
were
characterized
by
increases
of
the
spectral
power
in
the
alpha
1
and
beta
range
,
at
higher
dosages
also
in
the
theta
range
.

This
observed
pattern
of
changes
is
in
line
with
the
neuroleptic
induced
spectral
changes
reported
in
the
literature
for
other
animals
and
man
.

In
the
light
of
the
already
known
effects
of
other
psychoactive
drugs
on
the
frequency
content
of
field
potentials
in
the
rat
,
it
should
now
be
possible
to
classify
different
drugs
in
terms
of
their
clinical
indication
.

With
respect
to
the
type
of
neurotransmitter
control
underlying
the
changes
produced
by
various
neuroleptics
,
it
is
quite
obvious
from
the
comparisons
with
the
respective
drug
effects
that
dopamine-D1-receptor
controlled
transmission
is
not
responsible
for
this
action
.

On
the
basis
of
earlier
findings
a
possible
interaction
between
dopamine-D2
receptor
or
glutamatergic
transmitter
control
is
discussed
.

Abstract
1
.

Metabolism
of
ABT-107
was
investigated
in
in
vitro
hepatic
systems
,
in
rat
and
monkey
receiving
[
(
14
)
C
]
ABT-107
,
and
in
vivo
plasma
in
rat
,
dog
,
monkey
and
human
.

2
.

In
in
vitro
hepatic
systems
,
ABT-107
was
primarily
cleared
via
oxidative
metabolism
,
and
proceeded
via
two
parallel
pathways
.

Pathway
1
,
ABT-107
was
oxidized
at
the
nitrogen
of
quinuclidine
moiety
to
form
M1
.

Pathway
2
,
oxidation
occurred
at
indole-containing
moiety
to
form
M2
.

Metabolism
via
N-oxidation
was
predominant
in
dog
and
rat
,
while
in
monkey
and
human
,
metabolism
proceeded
primarily
via
oxidation
of
indole-containing
moiety
.

3
.

ABT-107
was
extensively
metabolized
in
vivo
in
rat
and
monkey
.

M1
was
primarily
found
in
rat
urine
and
bile;
whereas
,
M2
was
the
major
metabolite
in
monkey
urine
and
feces
.

M1
was
the
predominant
circulating
metabolite
in
dog
and
rat
.

M2
was
the
primary
circulating
metabolite
in
monkey
and
human
.

4
.

Enzymatic
studies
suggested
M1
formation
was
primarily
mediated
by
renal
FMO1
.

CYP3A4
,
1A2
,
2J2
and
2D6
were
primary
enzymes
catalyzing
M2
formation
.

Biotransformation
of
ABT-107
in
human
and
monkey
is
markedly
different
from
that
in
dog
and
rat
,
suggesting
that
monkey
is
an
appropriate
model
for
predicting
human
biotransformation
and
toxicology
of
ABT-107
.

Human
paraoxonase-1
(
HuPON1
)
has
been
proposed
as
a
catalytic
bioscavenger
of
organophosphorus
(
OP
)
pesticides
and
nerve
agents
.

We
assessed
the
potential
of
this
enzyme
to
protect
against
OP
poisoning
using
two
different
paradigms
.

First
,
recombinant
HuPON1
purified
from
cabbage
loopers
(
iPON1;
Trichoplusia
ni
)
was
administered
to
guinea
pigs
,
followed
by
exposure
to
at
least
2times
the
median
lethal
dose
(
LD50
)
of
the
OP
nerve
agents
tabun
(
GA
)
,
sarin
(
GB
)
,
soman
(
GD
)
,
and
cyclosarin
(
GF
)
,
or
chlorpyrifos
oxon
,
the
toxic
metabolite
of
the
OP
pesticide
chlorpyrifos
.

In
the
second
model
,
mice
were
infected
with
an
adenovirus
that
induced
expression
of
HuPON1
and
then
exposed
to
sequential
doses
of
GD
,
VX
,
or
(
as
reported
previously
)
diazoxon
,
the
toxic
metabolite
of
the
OP
pesticide
diazinon
.

In
both
animal
models
,
the
exogenously
added
HuPON1
protected
animals
against
otherwise
lethal
doses
of
the
OP
pesticides
but
not
against
the
nerve
agents
.

Together
,
the
results
support
prior
modeling
and
in
vitro
activity
data
which
suggest
that
wild-type
HuPON1
does
not
have
sufficient
catalytic
activity
to
provide
in
vivo
protection
against
nerve
agents
.
Many
members
of
the
nudix
hydrolase
family
exhibit
considerable
substrate
multispecificity
and
ambiguity
,
which
raises
significant
issues
when
assessing
their
functions
in
vivo
and
gives
rise
to
errors
in
database
annotation
.

Several
display
low
antimutator
activity
when
expressed
in
bacterial
tester
strains
as
well
as
some
degree
of
activity
in
vitro
towards
mutagenic
,
oxidized
nucleotides
such
as
8-oxo-dGTP
.

However
,
many
of
these
show
greater
activity
towards
other
nucleotides
such
as
ADP-ribose
or
diadenosine
tetraphosphate
(
Ap
(
4
)
A
)
.

The
antimutator
activities
have
tended
to
gain
prominence
in
the
literature
,
whereas
they
may
in
fact
represent
the
residual
activity
of
an
ancestral
antimutator
enzyme
that
has
become
secondary
to
the
more
recently
evolved
major
activity
after
gene
duplication
.

Whether
any
meaningful
antimutagenic
function
has
also
been
retained
in
vivo
requires
very
careful
assessment
.

Then
again
,
other
examples
of
substrate
ambiguity
may
indicate
as
yet
unexplored
regulatory
systems
.

For
example
,
bacterial
Ap
(
4
)
A
hydrolases
also
efficiently
remove
pyrophosphate
from
the
5'
termini
of
mRNAs
,
suggesting
a
potential
role
for
Ap
(
4
)
A
in
the
control
of
bacterial
mRNA
turnover
,
while
the
ability
of
some
eukaryotic
mRNA
decapping
enzymes
to
degrade
IDP
and
dIDP
or
diphosphoinositol
polyphosphates
(
DIPs
)
may
also
be
indicative
of
new
regulatory
networks
in
RNA
metabolism
.

DIP
phosphohydrolases
also
degrade
diadenosine
polyphosphates
and
inorganic
polyphosphates
,
suggesting
further
avenues
for
investigation
.

This
article
uses
these
and
other
examples
to
highlight
the
need
for
a
greater
awareness
of
the
possible
significance
of
substrate
ambiguity
among
the
nudix
hydrolases
as
well
as
the
need
to
exert
caution
when
interpreting
incomplete
analyses
.
The
goal
of
the
present
study
was
to
compare
the
effects
of
three
potent
reference
renin
inhibitors
(
remikiren
,
CGP
38560A
,
and
enalkiren
)
in
sodium-depleted
normotensive
squirrel
monkeys
.

In
these
monkeys
,
arterial
pressure
was
measured
in
the
conscious
state
with
a
telemetry
system
.

Oral
and
intravenous
maximal
effective
doses
of
the
three
renin
inhibitors
were
compared
in
parallel
groups
of
monkeys
.

In
additional
experiments
,
remikiren
was
given
on
top
of
either
CGP
38560A
or
enalkiren
in
the
same
animals
.

Finally
,
the
three
drugs
were
compared
with
the
angiotensin
converting
enzyme
inhibitor
cilazapril
.

The
effects
of
the
three
drugs
on
the
plasma
components
of
the
renin-angiotensin
system
(
plasma
renin
activity
,
immunoreactive
renin
,
and
immunoreactive
angiotensin
II
concentrations
)
were
also
measured
.

Our
results
show
that
remikiren
was
as
effective
as
cilazapril
and
markedly
more
effective
than
CGP
38560A
or
enalkiren
in
reducing
arterial
pressure
in
our
monkey
model
.

Interestingly
,
these
differences
in
arterial
pressure
could
not
be
explained
by
differences
of
in
vitro
potency
or
different
biochemical
changes
of
the
plasma
components
of
the
renin-angiotensin
system
,
because
the
inhibitors
all
reduced
immunoreactive
angiotensin
II
to
similarly
low
levels
.

One
possible
explanation
is
that
,
in
our
model
,
remikiren
in
contrast
to
CGP
38560A
and
enalkiren
is
able
to
inhibit
renin
in
a
functionally
important
extraplasmatic
compartment
.

Enalkiren
(
A-64662
)
,
a
potent
,
dipeptide
renin
inhibitor
,
mimics
the
transition
state
of
the
human
renin
substrate
,
angiotensinogen
.

Enalkiren
has
been
shown
to
produce
dose-related
suppression
of
plasma
renin
activity
(
PRA
)
and
angiotensin
II
when
administered
intravenously
.

Doses
of
enalkiren
of
less
than
0
.
1
mg
/
kg
induced
little
hemodynamic
response
in
normotensive
and
hypertensive
volunteers
despite
marked
suppression
of
PRA
.

However
,
at
doses
of
0
.
3
and
1
.
2
mg
/
kg
,
enalkiren
produced
significant
,
dose-related
decreases
in
systolic
and
diastolic
blood
pressure
(
BP
)
in
hypertensive
patients
,
and
the
BP
response
was
enhanced
by
pretreatment
with
hydrochlorothiazide
.

The
effects
of
enalkiren
on
PRA
and
BP
are
prolonged
despite
its
relatively
short
elimination
phase
plasma
half-life
(
1
.
6
h
)
.

Persistent
pharmacologic
activity
without
evidence
of
tachyphylaxis
was
demonstrated
during
1
week
of
treatment
in
hypertensive
patients
.

The
observed
dissociation
between
suppression
of
PRA
and
BP
response
and
the
recruitment
of
dose-related
BP
decrements
,
despite
complete
suppression
of
PRA
,
are
unexplained
phenomena
.

The
results
of
clinical
trials
with
enalkiren
are
encouraging
,
and
suggest
that
renin
inhibitors
may
be
safe
,
useful
therapeutic
agents
in
the
management
of
hypertension
.
Hyperhomocyst
(
e
)
inemia
is
a
metabolic
derangement
that
is
linked
to
the
distribution
of
folate
pools
,
which
provide
one-carbon
units
for
biosynthesis
of
purines
and
thymidylate
and
for
remethylation
of
homocysteine
to
form
methionine
.

In
humans
,
methionine
synthase
deficiency
results
in
the
accumulation
of
methyltetrahydrofolate
at
the
expense
of
folate
derivatives
required
for
purine
and
thymidylate
biosynthesis
.

Complete
ablation
of
methionine
synthase
activity
in
mice
results
in
embryonic
lethality
.

Other
mouse
models
for
hyperhomocyst
(
e
)
inemia
have
normal
or
reduced
levels
of
methyltetrahydrofolate
and
are
not
embryonic
lethal
,
although
they
have
decreased
ratios
of
AdoMet
/
AdoHcy
and
impaired
methylation
.

We
have
constructed
a
mouse
model
with
a
gene
trap
insertion
in
the
Mtrr
gene
specifying
methionine
synthase
reductase
,
an
enzyme
essential
for
the
activity
of
methionine
synthase
.

This
model
is
a
hypomorph
,
with
reduced
methionine
synthase
reductase
activity
,
thus
avoiding
the
lethality
associated
with
the
absence
of
methionine
synthase
activity
.

Mtrr
(
gt
/
gt
)
mice
have
increased
plasma
homocyst
(
e
)
ine
,
decreased
plasma
methionine
,
and
increased
tissue
methyltetrahydrofolate
.

Unexpectedly
,
Mtrr
(
gt
/
gt
)
mice
do
not
show
decreases
in
the
AdoMet
/
AdoHcy
ratio
in
most
tissues
.

The
different
metabolite
profiles
in
the
various
genetic
mouse
models
for
hyperhomocyst
(
e
)
inemia
may
be
useful
in
understanding
biological
effects
of
elevated
homocyst

Low
levels
of
serotonin
may
reduce
the
density
of
the
serotonin
transporter
(
SERT
)
by
either
increasing
trafficking
or
reducing
synthesis;
a
"neuroadaptive
response"
.

To
determine
whether
3
,
4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine
(
MDMA
)
-induced
reductions
in
SERT
density
could
be
related
to
such
a
mechanism
,
p-chlorophenylalanine
or
MDMA
was
administered
to
rats
,
and
brain
serotonin
and
SERT
density
were
measured
.

As
expected
,
both
treatments
led
to
serotonin
depletion
1
,
7
and
14
days
later
.

However
,
only
MDMA
reduced
SERT
density
.

This
observation
suggests
that
MDMA-induced
reductions
in
SERT
density
do
not
represent
neuroadaptive
responses
to
decreased
levels
of
brain
serotonin
,
but
may
occur
in
response
to
some
other
stimulus
or
to
the
neurotoxic
effects
of
MDMA
.

,
we
showed
that
the
sphingosine
kinase

sphingosine
1-phosphate
(

pathway
couples
TNF
receptor
to

In
this
study
,
the
requirement
for
acid
sphingomyelinase
and
sphingomyelin
metabolites
in
the
TNFalpha
/
prostaglandin
E
(
2
)
(
PGE
(

)
)
pathway
was
investigated
.

The
amphiphilic
compound
desipramine
,
a
frequently
employed
inhibitor
of
acid
sphingomyelinase
(
ASMase
)
,
blocked
PGE
(
2
)
production
.

However
,
the
action
of
desipramine
was
independent
of
its
action
on
ASMase
,
since
neither
genetic
loss
of
ASMase
(
Niemann-Pick
fibroblasts
)
nor
knockdown
of
ASMase
using
RNA
interference
affected
TNFalpha-induced
PGE
(
2
)
synthesis
.

Further
investigations
revealed
that
desipramine
down-regulated
acid
ceramidase
(
AC
)
,
but
not
sphingosine
kinase
,
at
the
protein
level
.

This
resulted
in
a
time-dependent
drop
in
sphingosine
and
S1P
levels
.

Moreover
,
exogenous
administration
of
either
sphingosine
or
S1P
rescued
PGE
(
2
)
biosynthesis
after
desipramine
treatment
.

Interestingly
,
knockdown
of
endogenous
AC
by
RNA
interference
attenuated
cyclooxygenase
2
induction
by
TNFalpha
and
subsequent
PGE
(
2
)
biosynthesis
.

Taken
together
,
these
results
define
a
novel
role
for
AC
in
the
TNFalpha
/
PGE
(
2
)
pathway
.

In
addition
,
the
results
of
this
study
warrant
careful
reconsideration
of
desipramine
as
a
specific
inhibitor
for
ASMase
.
INTRODUCTION
:
Janus
kinases
(
JAKs
)
comprise
a
family
of
four
enzymes
,
JAK1
,
JAK2
,
JAK3
and
tyrosine
kinase
2
(
TYK2
)
,
centrally
implicated
in
cell
signaling
processes
important
in
cancer
and
immune-inflammatory
diseases
.

Progression
in
the
field
has
taken
a
recent
step
forward
with
the
approval
of
ruxolitinib
(
Jakafi
)
,
a
selective
inhibitor
of
JAK1
/
2
and
very
recently
tofacitinib
(
Xeljanz
)
,
a
pan-JAK
inhibitor
.

There
are
many
new
JAK
family
enzyme
inhibitors
in
the
clinic
now
with
a
range
of
selectivity
profiles
.

More
selective
JAK2
or
JAK3
compounds
are
now
coming
through
in
considerable
numbers
and
this
review
attempts
to
provide
an
update
of
the
recent
patent
literature
of
those
new
compounds
.

An
overview
is
given
on
the
diversity
of
core
structures
employed
for
inhibitor
design
showing
that
the
vast
majority
of
compounds
are
based
on
classic
ATP-competitive
kinase
inhibitor
heterocycles
.

AREAS
COVERED
:
This
review
updates
new
patents
claiming
JAK2
and
/
or
JAK3
inhibitors
published
from
2010
to
2012
.

Pre-2010
patents
have
been
extensively
covered
in
previous
reviews
.

Comments
on
the
context
of
each
chemical
series
are
given
where
applicable
to
orientate
the
readers
on
the
bewildering
array
of
molecular
designs
now
available
.

This
review
does
not
cover
JAK1
or
TYK2
inhibitors
but
mention
is
made
of
these
where
they
occur
within
series
of
JAK2
/
3
inhibitors
.

Given
the
overlap
between
many
pharmacophores
,
it
was
not
possible
to
completely
separate
inhibitors
of
JAK2
from
JAK3
,
hence
the
material
is
organized
by
JAK2
,
JAK3
and
JAK2
/
3
and
within
each
section
by
alphabetical
order
of
the
patent
assignee
,
some
companies
having
published
five
or
more
patents
,
such
as
Ambit
(
10
)
,
Incyte
(

)
,
Galapagos
(

)
,

EXPERT
OPINION
:
JAK
inhibitor
therapy
is
entering
a
significant
new
era
with
the
advent
on
the
market
of
the
JAK1
/
2
inhibitor
ruxolitinib
and
the
pan-JAK
inhibitor
tofacitinib
,
with
unprecedented
speed
of
development
.

Selectivity
against
the
four
individual
JAK
family
enzymes
,
JAK1
,
2
,
3
and
TYK2
,
is
now
a
key
goal
since
they
each
play
subtly
different
roles
in
cytokine-induced
cell
signaling
.

The
future
looks
bright
for
patients
as
many
new
drugs
are
being
developed
and
now
combinations
of
JAK
inhibitors
with
other
targeted
agents
are
being
studied
in
the
clinic
.

These
advances
are
expected
to
lead
to
further
significant
progress
improving
patient
outcomes
and
quality
of
life
.
FARP2
is
a
Dbl-family
guanine
nucleotide
exchange
factor
(
GEF
)
that
contains
a
4
.
1
,
ezrin
,
radixin
and
moesin
(
FERM
)
domain
,
a
Dbl-homology
(
DH
)
domain
and
two
pleckstrin
homology
(
PH
)
domains
.

FARP2
activates
Rac1
or
Cdc42
in
response
to
upstream
signals
,
thereby
regulating
processes
such
as
neuronal
axon
guidance
and
bone
homeostasis
.

How
the
GEF
activity
of
FARP2
is
regulated
remained
poorly
understood
.

We
have
determined
the
crystal
structures
of
the
catalytic
DH
domain
and
the
DH-PH-PH
domains
of
FARP2
.

The
structures
reveal
an
auto-inhibited
conformation
in
which
the
GEF
substrate-binding
site
is
blocked
collectively
by
the
last
helix
in
the
DH
domain
and
the
two
PH
domains
.

This
conformation
is
stabilized
by
multiple
interactions
among
the
domains
and
two
well-structured
inter-domain
linkers
.

Our
cell-based
activity
assays
confirm
the
suppression
of
the
FARP2
GEF
activity
by
these
auto-inhibitory
elements

We
report
the
cloning
and
characterization
of
a
novel
serotonin
receptor
,
designated
as
5-HT7
,
which
is
coupled
to
the
stimulation
of
adenylyl
cyclase
.

5-HT7
mRNA
is
expressed
discretely
throughout
the
CNS
,
predominantly
in
the
thalamus
and
hypothalamus
.

5-HT7
has
a
unique
pharmacological
profile
that
redefines
agonist
and
antagonist
classification
of
ligands
previously
thought
to
be
"selective
.

"
The
circadian
phase
of
spontaneous
neuronal
activity
of
the
rat
suprachiasmatic
nucleus
of
the
hypothalamus
advances
in
response
to
serotonin
ligands
with
a
pharmacological
profile
consistent
exclusively
with
that
of
5-HT7
.

These
findings
suggest
a
physiological
role
in
the
regulation
of
circadian
rhythms
for
one
subtype
of
serotonin
receptor
,
5-HT7
,
and
provide
a
pharmacological
test
to
evaluate
its
role
in
other
neuronal
systems

Alimta
is
a
new-generation
antifolate
with
inhibitory
activity
against
multiple
enzymes
,
including
thymidylate
synthase
,
glycinamide
ribonucleotide
formyltransferase
and
dihydrofolate
reductase
.

Alimta
is
undergoing
broad
phase
II
evaluation
as
a
single
agent
,
and
preliminary
results
show
responses
in
several
tumor
types
,
including
breast
carcinoma
.

Doxorubicin
is
often
used
in
combination
chemotherapy
of
breast
cancer
.

Because
the
two
drugs
have
mechanisms
of
action
that
might
be
complementary
,
we
investigated
a
possible
synergism
between
doxorubicin
and
Alimta
on
growth
inhibition
of
ZR-75-1
human
breast
carcinoma
cells
.

Cytostatic
activity
was
evaluated
using
semi-automated
MTT
assays
,
and
drug
interactions
were
determined
using
CalcuSyn
(
Chou
/
Hayball
)
multiple
drug
effect
analyses
.

The
cells
were
exposed
to
Alimta
or
doxorubicin
as
single
agents
and
combinations
for
24
hours
starting
at
the
time
of
plating
or
for
72
hours
starting
24
hours
after
plating
with
a
total
culture
time
of
96
hours
.

Preincubation
with
Alimta
for
24
hours
followed
by
exposure
to
doxorubicin
for
72
hours
resulted
in
highly
synergistic
activity
,
whereas
the
opposite
sequence
or
simultaneous
exposure
produced
mainly
an
additive
response
.

DNA
flow
cytometry
studies
indicated
that
Alimta
causes
a
build-up
of
cells
near
the
G1
/
S
interface
after
24
hours
of
incubation
.

The
data
suggest
that
,
to
obtain
maximal
antitumor
activity
,
Alimta
should
precede
doxorubicin
when
the
drugs
are
given
in
combination
chemotherapy
protocols
.

The
main

include
disorders
which
all
have
defective

Methylenetetrahydrofolate
reductase
deficiency
impairs
methyltetrahydrofolate
synthesis
,
defects
in
cytosolic
reduction
of
hydroxocobalamin
(
CblC
/
D
)
impair
the
synthesis
of
both
methyl-
and
adenosyl
cobalamin
and
deficiencies
of
methionine
synthase
(
CblE
/
G
)
are
associated
with
defective
methyl
cobalamin
synthesis
.

The
clinical
presentation
is
characterized
by
acute
neurological
distress
in
early
infancy
.

In
childhood
,
patients
present
with
progressive
encephalopathy
with
an
end-stage
which
has
many
signs
in
common
with
the
adult
onset
form
.

In
fact
,
both
have
more
or
less
severe
signs
of
subacute
degeneration
of
the
cord
.

Cobalamin
defective
patients
must
be
treated
with
parenteral
supplementation
of
hydroxocobalamin
(
1-2
mg
per
dose
)
.

Some
methylenetetrahydrofolate
patients
could
be
folate
responsive
and
must
have
a
high-dosage
folate
trial
.

In
addition
,
oral
betaine
supplementation
(
2-9
g
per
day
depending
on
age
)
appears
an
effective
means
to
prevent
further
neurological
deterioration
.
The
estrogen-related
receptor
(
ERR
)
gamma
behaves
as
a
constitutive
activator
of
transcription
.

Although
no
natural
ligand
is
known
,
ERRgamma
is
deactivated
by
the
estrogen
receptor
(
ER
)
agonist
diethylstilbestrol
and
the
selective
ER
modulator
4-hydroxytamoxifen
but
does
not
significantly
respond
to
estradiol
or
raloxifene
.

Here
we
report
the
crystal
structures
of
the
ERRgamma
ligand
binding
domain
(
LBD
)
complexed
with
diethylstilbestrol
or
4-hydroxytamoxifen
.

Antagonist
binding
to
ERRgamma
results
in
a
rotation
of
the
side
chain
of
Phe-435
that
partially
fills
the
cavity
of
the
apoLBD
.

The
new
rotamer
of
Phe-435
displaces
the
"activation
helix"
(
helix
12
)
from
the
agonist
position
observed
in
the
absence
of
ligand
.

In
contrast
to
the
complexes
of
the
ERalpha
LBD
with
4-hydroxytamoxifen
or
raloxifene
,
helix
12
of
antagonist-bound
ERRgamma
does
not
occupy
the
coactivator
groove
but
appears
to
be
completely
dissociated
from
the
LBD
body
.

Comparison
of
the
ligand-bound
LBDs
of
ERRgamma
and
ERalpha
reveals
small
but
significant
differences
in
the
architecture
of
the
ligand
binding
pockets
that
result
in
a
slightly
shifted
binding
position
of
diethylstilbestrol
and
a
small
rotation
of
4-hydroxytamoxifen
in
the
cavity
of
ERRgamma
relative
to
ERalpha
.

Our
results
provide
detailed
molecular
insight
into
the
conformational
changes
occurring
upon
binding
of
synthetic
antagonists
to
the
constitutive
orphan
receptor
ERRgamma
and
reveal
structural
differences
with
ERs
that
explain
why
ERRgamma
does
not
bind
estradiol
or
raloxifene
and
will
help
to
design
new
selective
antagonists
.

EGFR
)
is
a
central
regulator
of
tumor
progression
in
human
cancers
.

Cetuximab
is
an
anti-EGFR
antibody
that
has
been
approved
for
use
in
oncology
.

Previously
we
investigated
mechanisms
of
resistance
to
cetuximab
using
a
model
derived
from
the
non-small
cell
lung
cancer
line
NCI-H226
.

We
demonstrated
that
cetuximab-resistant
clones
(
Ctx
(
R
)
)
had
increased
nuclear
localization
of
the
EGFR
.

This
process
was
mediated
by
Src
family
kinases
(
SFKs
)
,
and
nuclear
EGFR
had
a
role
in
resistance
to
cetuximab
.

To
better
understand
SFK-mediated
nuclear
translocation
of
EGFR
,
we
investigated
which
SFK
member
(
s
)
controlled
this
process
as
well
as
the
EGFR
tyrosine
residues
that
are
involved
.

Analyses
of
mRNA
and
protein
expression
indicated
upregulation
of
the
SFK
members
Yes
(
v-Yes-1
yamaguchi
sarcoma
viral
oncogene
)
and
Lyn
(
v-yes-1
Yamaguchi
sarcoma
viral-related
oncogene
homolog
)
in
all
Ctx
(
R
)
clones
.

Further
,
immunoprecipitation
analysis
revealed
that
EGFR
interacts
with
Yes
and
Lyn
in
Ctx
(
R
)
clones
,
but
not
in
cetuximab-sensitive
(
Ctx
(
S
)
)
parental
cells
.

Using
RNAi
interference
,
we
found
that
knockdown
of
either
Yes
or
Lyn
led
to
loss
of
EGFR
translocation
to
the
nucleus
.

Conversely
,
overexpression
of
Yes
or
Lyn
in
low
nuclear
EGFR-expressing
Ctx
(
S
)
parental
cells
led
to
increased
nuclear
EGFR
.

Chromatin
immunoprecipitation
(
ChIP
)
assays
confirmed
nuclear
EGFR
complexes
associated
with
the
promoter
of
the
known
EGFR
target
genes
B-Myb
and
iNOS
.

Further
,
all
Ctx
(
R
)
clones
exhibited
upregulation
of
B-Myb
and
iNOS
at
the
mRNA
and
protein
levels
.

siRNAs
directed
at
Yes
or
Lyn
led
to
decreased
binding
of
EGFR
complexes
to
the
B-Myb
and
iNOS
promoters
based
on
ChIP
analyses
.

SFKs
have
been
shown
to
phosphorylate
EGFR
on
tyrosines
845
and
1101
(
Y845
and
Y1101
)
,
and
mutation
of
Y1101
,
but
not
Y845
,
impaired
nuclear
entry
of
the
EGFR
.

Taken
together
,
our
findings
demonstrate
that
Yes
and
Lyn
phosphorylate
EGFR
at
Y1101
,
which
influences
EGFR
nuclear
translocation
in
this
model
of
cetuximab
resistance
.
Over
the
past
20
years
,
studies
of
transient
receptor
potential
(
TRP
)
channels
have
significantly
extended
our
knowledge
regarding
the
molecular
basis
of
Ca2
+
signals
in
cardiac
myocytes
.

The
functional
significance
of
cardiac
TRP
channels
is
likely
connected
to
the
alteration
of
membrane
potential
or
Ca2
+
entry
into
a
noncontractile
compartment
,
where
gene
expression
responsible
for
various
cardiac
diseases
is
induced
.

This
review
highlights
some
aspects
of
TRP
channels
with
anticipated
roles
in
cardiac
disease
.

Evidence
suggests
that
(
a
)
increased
activities
of
TRPC1
,
TRPC3
,
or
TRPC6
are
involved
in
the
development
of
cardiac
hypertrophy
,
where
these
TRPC
channels
act
as
unique
sensors
for
a
wide
range
of
hypertrophic
stimuli
,
and
(
b
)
mutations
in
TRPM4
are
now
recognized
as
causes
of
human
cardiac
conduction
disorders
.

Ultimately
,
TRP
channels
may
become
novel
pharmacological
targets
in
the
treatment
of
human
cardiac
disease
.
Originally
identified
as
an

cytotoxin
,
nitric
oxide
(
(
·
)
NO
)
formation
in
tumors
can
influence
chemotherapy
and
exacerbate
cancer
progression
.

Here
,
we
examined
the
hypothesis
that
(
·
)
NO
generation
contributes
to
cancer
cell
drug
resistance
toward
the
widely
used
anticancer
drug
Etoposide
(
VP-16
)
.

The
UV-vis
spectrum
of
VP-16
was
not
changed
by
exposure
of
VP-16
to
(
·
)
NO
in
aqueous
buffer
.

In
contrast
,
reddish-orange
compound
(
s
)
characteristic
of
o-quinone-
and
nitroso-VP-16
were
readily
generated
in
a
hydrophobic
medium
(
chloroform
)
in
an
oxygen-dependent
manner
.

Similar
products
were
also
formed
when
the
VP-16
radical
,
generated
from
VP-16
and
horseradish
peroxidase
/
H2O2
,
was
exposed
directly
to
(
·
)
NO
in
chloroform
in
the
presence
of
oxygen
.

Separation
and
spectral
analysis
of
VP-16
reaction
extracts
by
electron
spin
resonance
and
UV-vis
indicated
the
generation
of
the
phenoxy
radical
and
the
o-quinone
of
VP-16
,
as
well
as
putative
nitroxide
,
iminoxyl
,
and
other
nitrogen
oxide
intermediates
.

Nitric
oxide
products
of
VP-16
displayed
significantly
diminished
topoisomerase
II-dependent
cleavage
of
DNA
and
cytotoxicity
to
human
HL-60
leukemia
cells
.

LPS-mediated
induction
of
nitric
oxide
synthase
in
murine
macrophages
resulted
in
VP-16
resistance
compared
to
Raw
cells
.

Furthermore
,
(
·
)
NO
products
derived
from
iNOS
rapidly
reacted
with
VP-16
leading
to
decreased
DNA
damage
and
cytotoxicity
.

Together
,
these
observations
suggest
that
the
formation
of
(
·
)
NO
in
tumors
(
associated
macrophages
)
can
contribute
to
VP-16
resistance
via
the
detoxification
of
VP-16

PURPOSE
:
Previously
,
we
studied
the
effect
of
co-administration
of
paclitaxel
with
the
second
generation
ABCB1
(
p-gp
)
modulator
valspodar
on
the
intracerebral
growth
of
human
U118-MG
glioblastoma
in
nude
mice
.

Valspodar
significantly
increased
the
brain
levels
of
paclitaxel
by
inhibition
of
p-gp
expressed
at
the
blood
brain
barrier
.

Thus
,
the
tumour
burden
was
reduced
by
90%
,
which
was
considered
as
a
proof
of
concept
.

However
,
the
paclitaxel
dose
had
to
be
reduced
because
of
toxic
side
effects
resulting
from
increased
drug
levels
due
to
p-gp
modulation
in
peripheral
tissues
.

Therefore
,
in
the
present
study
we
examined
the
co-application
of
paclitaxel
with
the
third
generation
ABCB1
modulators
elacridar
and
tariquidar
,
which
were
supposed
to
preferentially
modulate
p-gp
in
brain
capillaries
.

METHODS
:
The
inhibitory
activity
of
the
modulators
was
measured
by
a
flow
cytometric
and
a
chemosensitivity
assay
in
vitro
.

To
determine
the
distribution
of
paclitaxel
in
vivo
,
nude
mice
received
50

/
kg
of
valspodar
,
elacridar

of

.

Brain
,
liver
,
kidney
and
plasma
were
collected
and
analyzed
by
RP-HPLC
.

RESULTS
:
Our
in
vitro
experiments
demonstrate
that
the
new
modulators
are
about
80
times
more
effective
in
comparison
to
valspodar
.

Co-administration
of
paclitaxel
with
elacridar
and
tariquidar
led
to
a
long
lasting
fivefold
increase
in
the
concentration
of
the
cytostatic
in
the
brain
.

Although
the
increase
(
2
.
5-
to
7-fold
)
tended
to
be
lower
compared
to
that
induced
by
co-administered
valspodar
(
six-
to
eightfold
)
,
the
brain
/
plasma
ratios
achieved
with
the
new
modulators
were
2-15
times
higher
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
Elacridar
and
tariquidar
seem
to
modulate
p-glycoprotein
preferentially
at
the
blood-brain
barrier
.

Our
results
suggest
that
the
systemic
toxicity
of
cytostatics
combined
with
elacridar
or
tariquidar
should
be
lower
than
in
combination
with
valspodar
.

The

As

,
we

that

modulate

In

and
thickness
were
decreased
by
14%
and
11%
,
respectively
.

Histomorphometric
analysis
demonstrated
that
tartrate-resistant
acid
phosphatase
(
TRAP
)
(
+
)
osteoclast
number
and
area
were
significantly
increased
in
CD74
KO
by
35%
and
43%
,
respectively
compared
to
WT
.

Finally
,
we
examined
the
effect
of
MIF
on
RANKL-induced-signaling
pathways
in
bone
marrow
macrophage
(
BMM
)
cultures
.

MIF
treatment
decreased
RANKL-induced
nuclear
factor
of
activated
T
cells
,
cytoplasmic
1
(
NFATc1
)
and
c-Fos
protein
in
BMM
cultures
by
70%
and
41%
,
respectively
.

Our
data
demonstrate
that
CD74
is
required
for
MIF
to
affect
in
vitro
osteoclastogenesis
.

Further
,
the
bone
phenotype
of
CD74
KO
mice
is
similar
to
that
of
MIF
KO
mice
.

MIF
treatment
of
WT
cultures
suppressed
RANKL-induced
activator
protein
1
(
AP-1
)
expression
,
which
resulted
in
decreased
osteoclast
differentiation
in
vitro
.

We
propose
that
CD74
plays
a
critical
role
in
the
MIF
inhibition
of
osteoclastogenesis
.
Background
:
Historically
,
systemic
therapy
for
radioactive
iodine
(
RAI
)
-refractory
thyroid
cancer
has
been
understudied
.

Available
drugs
have
modest
efficacy
.

Romidepsin
is
a
histone
deacetylase
inhibitor
with
potent
antitumor
effects
both
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
.

In
thyroid
cancer
cell
lines
,
romidepsin
increases
expression
of
both
thyroglobulin
and
the
sodium
iodide
symporter
messenger
RNAs
,
suggesting
the
possibility
of
improved
iodine
concentrating
ability
of
RAI-resistant
tumors
.

Methods
:
This
was
a
single-institution
Simon
2-stage
phase
II
clinical
study
.

Eligible
patients
had
progressive
,
RAI-refractory
,
recurrent

were
required
.

Romidepsin
13
mg

)
was
administered
intravenously
on
days
1
,
8
,
and
15
,
in
cycles
of
28
days
.

The
primary
endpoint
was
the
response
rate
by
RECIST;
change
in
RAI
avidity
was
a
secondary
endpoint
.

The
study
closed
after
the
first
stage
due
to
the
lack
of
response
.

Results
:
Twenty
patients
were

respectively
.

Conclusions
:
We
observed
preliminary
signs
of
in
vivo
reversal
of
RAI
resistance
after
treatment
with
romidepsin
.

However
,
no
major

were
observed
and

Vascular
dysfunction
plays
a
key
role
in
the
pathogenesis
of
diabetic
vascular
disease
.

In
this
study
,
we
aimed
to
investigate
whether
chronic
in
vivo
treatment
of
Crataegus
microphylla
(
CM
)
extract
in
diabetic
rats
induced
with
streptozotocin
(
STZ
,
intraperitoneal
,
65
mg
/
kg
)
preserves
vascular
function
and
to
evaluate
whether
the
reduction
of
inducible
nitric
oxide
synthase
(
iNOS
)
,
proinflammatory
cytokines
,
and
lipid
peroxidation
mediates
its
mechanisms
of
action
.

Starting
at
4
weeks
of
diabetes
,
CM
extract
(
100
mg
/
kg
)
was
administrated
to
diabetic
rats
for
4
weeks
.

In
aortic
rings
,
relaxation
to
acetylcholine
and
vasoreactivity
to
noradrenaline
were
impaired
,
whereas
aortic
iNOS
expression
and
plasma
tumor
necrosis
factor-α
(
TNF-α
)
and
interleukin-6
(
IL-6
)
,
total
nitrite-nitrate
,
and
malondialdehite
levels
were
increased
in
diabetic
rats
compared
with
controls
.

Chronic
CM
treatment
significantly
corrected
all
the
above
abnormalities
in
diabetic
rats
.

In
comparison
,
pretreatment
of
the
aorta
of
diabetic
rats
with
N-
[
3
(
aminomethyl
)
benzyl
]
-acetamidine
,
dihydrochloride
(
10
(
-5
)
M
)
,
a
selective
inhibitor
of
iNOS
,
produced
a
similar
recovery
in
vascular
reactivity
.

These
results
suggest
that
chronic
in
vivo
treatment
of
CM
preserves
endothelium-dependent
relaxation
and
vascular
contraction
in
STZ-induced
diabetes
,
possibly
by
reducing
iNOS
expression
in
the
aorta
and
by
decreasing
plasma
levels
of
TNF-α
and
IL-6
and
by
preventing
lipid
peroxidation
.

Recently
,
the
effect
of
minocycline
on
Alzheimer's
disease
has
been
also
reported
.

Although
its
precise
primary
target
is
not
clear
,
the
action
mechanisms
of
minocycline
for
neuroprotection
reported
so
far
are;
via;
the
inhibition
of
mitochondrial
permeability-transition
mediated
cytochrome

release
from
mitochondria
,
the
inhibition
of
caspase-1
and
-3
expressions
,
and
the
suppression
of
microglial
activation
,
involvement
in
some
signaling
pathways
,
metalloprotease
activity
inhibition
.

Because
of
the
high
tolerance
and
the
excellent
penetration
into
the
brain
,
minocycline
has
been
clinically
tried
for
some
neurodegenerative
diseases
such
as

,

,

summarize
the

action
mechanisms
of
minocycline
on
neurodegenerative

Allopurinol
is
an
inhibitor
of
xanthine
oxidoreductase
(
XOR
)
and
inhibits
the
generation
of
uric
acid
(
UA
)
as
the
final
product
of
purine
catabolism
,
as
well
as
the
resulting
generation
of
superoxide
(
O2
(

)
)
,
in
humans
.

Elevation
of
the
serum
UA
(
SUA
)
level
,
referred
to
as
hyperuricemia
(
HU
)
,
eventually
leads
to
gout
and
allopurinol
has
been
used
for
the
treatment
of
HU
and
gout
.

Studies
have
revealed
the
role
of
elevated
SUA
levels
and
the
associated
oxidative
stress
(
OS
)
in
a
broad
spectrum
of
pathological
conditions
and
it
is
anticipated
that
these
findings
would
also
expand
the
use
of
allopurinol
as
a
therapeutic
drug
.

This
article
presents
a
review
of
reports
,
mainly
of
recent
studies
,
on
the
efficacy
of
allopurinol
in
various

explores
novel

significantly
increased
the

also
blocked

a

Tetracyclines
have
recently
been
shown
to
have
"chondroprotective"
effects
in
inflammatory
arthritides
in
animal
models
.

Since
nitric
oxide
(
NO
)
is
spontaneously
released
from
human
cartilage
affected
by
osteoarthritis
(
OA
)
or
rheumatoid
arthritis
in
quantities
sufficient
to
cause
cartilage
damage
,
we
evaluated
the
effect
of
tetracyclines
on
the
expression
and
function
of
human
OA-affected
nitric
oxide
synthase
(
OA-NOS
)
and
rodent
inducible
NOS
(
iNOS
)
.

Among
the
tetracycline
group
of
compounds
,
doxycycline
>
minocycline
blocked
and
reversed
both
spontaneous
and
interleukin
1
beta-induced
OA-NOS
activity
in
ex
vivo
conditions
.

Similarly
,
minocycline
>
or
=
doxycycline
inhibited
both
lipopolysaccharide-
and
interferon-gamma-stimulated
iNOS
in
RAW
264
.
7
cells
in
vitro
,
as
assessed
by
nitrite
accumulation
.

Although
both
these
enzyme
isoforms
could
be
inhibited
by
doxycycline
and
minocycline
,
their
susceptibility
to
each
of
these
drugs
was
distinct
.

Unlike
acetylating
agents
or
competitive
inhibitors
of
L-arginine
that
directly
inhibit
the
specific
activity
of
NOS
,
doxycycline
or
minocycline
has
no
significant
effect
on
the
specific
activity
of
iNOS
in
cell-free
extracts
.

The
mechanism
of
action
of
these
drugs
on
murine
iNOS
expression
was
found
to
be
,
at
least
in
part
,
at
the
level
of
RNA
expression
and
translation
of
the
enzyme
,
which
would
account
for
the
decreased
iNOS
protein
and
activity
of
the
enzyme
.

Tetracyclines
had
no
significant
effect
on
the
levels
of
mRNA
for
beta-actin
and
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase
nor
on
levels
of
protein
of
beta-actin
and
cyclooxygenase
2
expression
.

These
studies
indicate
that
a
novel
mechanism
of
action
of
tetracyclines
is
to
inhibit
the
expression
of
NOS
.

Since
the
overproduction
of
NO
has
been
implicated
in
the
pathogenesis
of
arthritis
,
as
well
as
other
inflammatory
diseases
,
these
observations
suggest
that
tetracyclines
should
be
evaluated
as
potential
therapeutic
modulators
of
NO
for
various
pathological
conditions

and
the

are
known
to
control
the

implying
that

We
hypothesize
that

in
ligand-inhibited

Nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory
drugs
(
NSAIDs
)
have
been
reported
to
induce
apoptosis
in
a
variety
of
cell
lines
.

In
this
study
,
we
examined
the
effect
of
NSAIDs
on
the
growth
and
apoptosis
of
synovial
cells
from
patients
with
rheumatoid
arthritis
and
analyzed
the
activation
of
peroxisome
proliferator-activated
receptor
gamma
(
PPARgamma
)
as
a
possible
mechanism
of
action
of
NSAIDs
.

Cell
proliferation
and
viability
were
assessed
from
5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine
incorporation
and
by
4-
[
3-
(
4-iodophenyl
)
-2-
(
4-nitrophenyl
)
-2H-5-tetrazolio
]
-1
,
3-benzene
disulfonate
(
WST-1
)
assay
,
respectively
.

The
apoptosis
of
synovial
cells
was
identified
by
DNA
fragmentation
assay
and
terminal
deoxynucleotidyl
transferase-mediated
dUTP
nick-end
labeling
assay
.

Indometacin
,
diclofenac
,
oxaprozin
,
and
zaltoprofen
reduced
cell
proliferation
and
induced
apoptotic
cell
death
in
synovial
cells
,
whereas
ketoprofen
and
acetaminophen
did
not
.

N-
[
2-
(
cyclohexyloxyl
)
-4-nitrophenyl
]
-methanesulfonamide
(
NS-398
)
,
a
selective
cyclooxygenase-2
inhibitor
,
also
inhibited
cell
proliferation
,
whereas
it
did
not
cause
apoptosis
.

Rheumatoid
synovial
cells
expressed
PPARgamma
mRNA
,
and
the
PPARgamma
ligands
15-deoxy-Delta
(
12
,
14
)
-prostaglandin
J
(
2
)
and
troglitazone
reduced
the
proliferation
and
induced
apoptosis
in
synovial
cells
.

Luciferase
reporter
assay
demonstrated
that
not
only
PPARgamma
ligands
but
also
NSAIDs
,
which
could
induce
apoptosis
,
increased
the
activation
of
PPARgamma
in
synovial
cells
.

Furthermore
,
the
ability
of
NSAIDs
and
PPARgamma
ligands
to
stimulate
the
activation
of
PPARgamma
correlated
with
their
ability
to
decrease
cell
viability
(
r
=
0
.
92
,
p
<
0
.
01
)
and
ability
to
induce
DNA
fragmentation
(
r
=
0
.
97
,
p
<
0
.
001
)
in
synovial
cells
.

These
results
suggest
that
PPARgamma
is
an
attractive
target
for
induction
of
apoptosis
in
rheumatoid
synovial
cells
and
that
the
activation
of
the
PPARgamma
pathway
is
associated
with
the
apoptotic
action
of
NSAIDs
.
A
complex
dynamic
ultradian
rhythm
underlies
the
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
(
HPA
)
circadian
rhythm
.

We
have
investigated
in
normal
human
male
subjects
the
importance
,
site
of
action
,
and
receptor-mediated
processes
involved
in
rapid
basal
corticosteroid
feedback
and
its
interaction
with
corticotrophin
releasing
hormone
(
CRH
)
drive
.

Pro-opiomelanocortin
(
POMC
)
,
ACTH
,
and
cortisol
were
measured
every
10
min
from
healthy
males
during
the
awakening
period
or
late
afternoon
using
an
automated
blood
sampling
system
.

Mathematical
modeling
into
discrete
pulses
of
activity
revealed
that
intravenous
infusion
of
the
synthetic
mixed
glucocorticoid
/
mineralocorticoid
agonist
prednisolone
produced
rapid
inhibition
of
ACTH
and
cortisol
pulsatility
within
30
min
in
the
morning
and
afternoon
.

Any
pulse
that
had
commenced
at
the
time
of
injection
was
unaffected
,
and
subsequent
pulsatility
was
inhibited
.

Prednisolone
also
inhibited
ACTH
and
cortisol
secretion
in
response
to
exogenous
CRH
stimulation
,
inferring
rapid
feedback
inhibition
at
the
anterior
pituitary
.

Circulating
POMC
peptide
concentrations
were
unaffected
,
suggesting
that
the
rapid
corticosteroid
inhibitory
effect
specifically
targeted
ACTH
secretion
from
pituitary
corticotrophs
.

Prednisolone
fast
feedback
was
only
reduced
by
glucocorticoid
receptor
antagonist
pretreatment
and
not
by
mineralocorticoid
receptor
antagonism
,
suggesting
a
glucocorticoid
receptor-mediated
pathway
.

The
intravenous
prednisolone
suppression
test
provides
a
powerful
new
tool
to
investigate
HPA
abnormalities
underlying
metabolic
and
psychiatric
disease
states

Atherosclerosis
is

Immunoglobulin

.

The
mechanisms
and
importance
of
the
Fc
portion
of
immunoglobulin
upon
experimental
atherosclerosis
in
apolipoprotein
E-deficient
mice
were
examined
.

Experimental
atherosclerosis
was
induced
in
mice
fed
a
high-fat
diet
containing
0
.
3%
cholesterol
.

Over
8
,
12
,
and
16
wk
,
on
alternate
days
,
mice
were
treated
with
an
intraperitoneal
injection
of

1
g

kg-1
.

day-1
of
human
intact
immunoglobulin
or
F
(
ab'
)
2
fragments
of
human
immunoglobulin
.

Fatty
streak
formation
and
fibrofatty
plaques
were
markedly
suppressed
in
mice
that
received
intact
immunoglobulin
for
8
,
12
,
and
16
wk
.

In
contrast
,
atherosclerotic
lesions
were
not
ameliorated
in
mice
that
received
F
(
ab'
)
2
fragments
.

Immunohistochemical
analysis
revealed
that
macrophage
accumulation
in
the
fatty
streak
lesions
was
suppressed
in
mice
received
intact
immunoglobulin
but
not
in
those
that
received
F
(
ab'
)
2
fragments
.

In
addition
,
the
cytotoxic
activities
of
splenocytes
from
immunoglobulin-treated
mice
,
but
not
from
F
(
ab'
)
2
fragment-treated
mice
,
were
significantly
suppressed
compared
with
those
from
human
serum
albumin-treated
mice
.

Differences
in
lesion
area
did
not
correlate
with
any
significant
alterations
in
serum
lipid
levels
.

Immunoglobulin
therapy
markedly
suppressed
atherosclerosis
due
to
Fc
receptor-mediated
anti-inflammatory
and
immunomodulating
actions
.

The
antiatherosclerotic
effects
of
immunoglobulin
may
be
related
to
the
suppression
of
cytotoxic
activity
of
atherogenic
T
cells
and
the
reduction
of
macrophage
accumulation
in
the
lesions

Prostate
cancer
is
often
slowly
progressive
,
and
it
can
be
difficult
to
treat
with
conventional
cytotoxic
drugs
.

Nonsteroidal
antiinflammatory
drugs
inhibit
the
development
of
prostate
cancer
,
but
the
mechanism
of
chemoprevention
is
unknown
.

Here
,
we
show
that
the
R-enantiomer
of
the
nonsteroidal
antiinflammatory
drug
etodolac
inhibited
tumor
development
and
metastasis
in
the
transgenic
mouse
adenocarcinoma
of
the
prostate
(
TRAMP
)
model
,
by
selective
induction
of
apoptosis
in
the
tumor
cells
.

This
proapoptotic
effect
was
associated
with
loss
of
the
retinoid
X
receptor
(
RXRalpha
)
protein
in
the
adenocarcinoma
cells
,
but
not
in
normal
prostatic
epithelium
.

R-etodolac
specifically
bound
recombinant
RXRalpha
,
inhibited
RXRalpha
transcriptional
activity
,
and
induced
its
degradation
by
a
ubiquitin
and
proteasome-dependent
pathway
.

The
apoptotic
effect
of
R-etodolac
could
be
controlled
by
manipulating
cellular
RXRalpha
levels
.

These
results
document
that
pharmacologic
antagonism
of
RXRalpha
transactivation
is
achievable
and
can
have
profound
inhibitory
effects
in
cancer
development

great
potential

Oxytocin
antagonist
(
OTA
)
,
TT-235
,
was
developed
by
our
group
and
shown
to
inhibit
either
spontaneous
or
oxytocin-induced
uterine
contractions
in
primates
.

The
purpose
of
the
present
study
was
to
confirm
the
duration
of
TT-235
to
block
oxytocin-induced
uterine
contractions
in
estrous
rats
.

In
Experiment
1
,
the
time-response
of
the
three
OTAs
on
uterine
contractility
was
examined
.

The
rats
were
anesthetized
and
cannulas
were
placed
in
the
jugular
vein
for
infusing
vehicle
(
sterile
saline
)
,
Antag
I
,
Antag
II
and
TT-235
.

The
uterine
activity
was
monitored
through
a
water-filled
balloon-tipped
cannula
placed
in
the
uterine
horn
.

The
uterine
contractile
activity
was
determined
as
the
integrated
area
for
10
minutes
.

Each
OTA
was
administered
as
a
single
bolus
injection
of
5
microg
,
followed
by
100
mU
of
oxytocin
5
minutes
later
,
also
done
as
a
single
bolus
.

Oxytocin
injection
of
the
same
dosage
was
repeated
every
hour
for
5
hours
.

Experiment
2
determined
the
effect
of
the
three
OTAs
on
uterine
oxytocin
receptor
number
(
Rn
)
and
binding
affinity
(
Kd
)
.

Rats
treated
with
either
OTA
or
vehicle
were
sacrificed
at
0
.
5
and
4
hours
for
receptor
assay
.

In
Experiment
1
,
Antag
I
,
Antag
II
and
TT-235
inhibited
the
integrated
uterine
response
to
oxytocin
at
5
minutes
by
76%
,
77%
and
80%
,
respectively
,
compared
to
controls
(
p<0
.
05
)
.

Two
hours
after
injecting
Antag
I
,
inhibition
of
uterine
contractility
was
55%
lower
than
controls
(
p<0
.
05
)
.

At
3
hours
,
uterine
contractility
was
no
longer
affected
in
rats
treated
with
Antag
I
compared
with
controls
.

The
suppressive
uterine
activity
with
Antag
II
continued
up
to
3
hours
.

However
,
uterine
contractility
remained
lower
(
53%
)
in
rats
treated
with
TT-235
5
hours
later
.

In
Experiment
2
,
TT-235
induced
a
significant
decrease
(
p<0
.
05
)
in
oxytocin
receptor
number
and
binding
affinity
at
both
0
.
5
and
4
hours
compared
with
controls
.

Antag
I
and
Antag
II
did
not
alter
oxytocin
receptor
number
or
binding
affinity
significantly
at
each
time
point
studied
compared
with
controls
.

In
conclusion
,
TT-235
may
inhibit
the
uterine
response
to
oxytocin
by
decreasing
oxytocin
receptor
numbers
and
oxytocin
binding
affinity
,
which
might
explain
the
prolonged
oxytocin
antagonist
activity
of
TT-235
.

Adopted
orphan
nuclear
receptor
(
NR
)
,
pregnane
X
receptor
(
PXR
)
,
plays
a
central
role
in
the
regulation
of
xeno-
and
endobiotic
metabolism
.

Since
the
discovery
of
the
functional
role
of
PXR
in
1998
,
there
is
evolving
evidence
for
the
role
of
PXR
agonists
in
abrogating
metabolic
pathophysiology
(
e
.

g
.

,
cholestasis
,
hypercholesterolemia
,
and
inflammation
)
.

However
,
more
recently
,
it
is
clear
that
PXR
is
also
an
important
mediator
of
adverse
xeno-
(
e
.

g
.

,
enhances
acetaminophen
toxicity
)
and
endobiotic
(
e
.

g
.

,
hepatic
steatosis
)
metabolic
phenotypes
.

Moreover
,
in
cancer
therapeutics
,
PXR
activation
can
induce
drug
resistance
,
and
there
is
growing
evidence
for
tissue-specific
enhancement
of
the
malignant
phenotype
.

Thus
,
in
these
instances
,
there
may
be
a
role
for
PXR
antagonists
.

However
,
as
opposed
to
the
discovery
efforts
for
PXR
agonists
,
there
are
only
a
few
antagonists
described
.

The
mode
of
action
of
these
antagonists
(
e
.

g
.

,
sulforaphane
)
remains
less
clear
.

Our
laboratory
efforts
have
focused
on
this
question
.

Since
the
original
discovery
of
azoles
analogs
as
PXR
antagonists
,
we
have
preliminarily
defined
an
important
PXR
antagonist
pharmacophore
and
developed
less-toxic
PXR
antagonists
.

In
this
review
,
we
describe
our
published
and
unpublished
findings
on
recent
structure-function
studies
involving
the
azole
chemical
scaffold
.

Further
work
in
the
future
is
needed
to
fully
define
potent
,
more-selective
PXR
antagonists
that
may
be
useful
in
clinical
application

Mammals
detect
temperature
with
specialized
neurons
in
the
peripheral
nervous
system
.

Four
TRPV-class
channels
have
been
implicated
in
sensing
heat
,
and
one
TRPM-class
channel
in
sensing
cold
.

The
combined
range
of
temperatures
that
activate
these
channels
covers
a
majority
of
the
relevant
physiological
spectrum
sensed
by
most
mammals
,
with
a
significant
gap
in
the
noxious
cold
range
.

Here
,
we
describe
the
characterization
of
ANKTM1
,
a
cold-activated
channel
with
a
lower
activation
temperature
compared
to
the
cold
and
menthol
receptor
,
TRPM8
.

ANKTM1
is
a
distant
family
member
of
TRP
channels
with
very
little
amino
acid
similarity
to
TRPM8
.

It
is
found
in
a
subset
of
nociceptive
sensory
neurons
where
it
is
coexpressed
with
TRPV1
/
VR1
(
the
capsaicin
/
heat
receptor
)
but
not
TRPM8
.

Consistent
with
the
expression
of
ANKTM1
,
we
identify
noxious
cold-sensitive
sensory
neurons
that
also
respond
to
capsaicin
but
not
to
menthol
.

Evidence
has
accumulated
that
some
of
the
angiotensin

AT1
receptor
antagonists
have
insulin-sensitizing
property
.

We
thus
examined
the
effect
of
telmisartan
on
insulin
action
using
3T3-L1
adipocytes
.

With
standard
differentiation
inducers
,
a
higher
dose
of
telmisartan
effectively
facilitated
differentiation
of
3T3-L1
preadipocytes
.

Treatment
of
both
differentiating
adipocytes
and
fully
differentiated
adipocytes
with
telmisartan
caused
a
dose-dependent
increase
in
mRNA
levels
for
PPARgamma
target
genes
such
as
aP2
and
adiponectin
.

By
contrast
,

Of
note
,
we
demonstrated
for
the
first
time
that
telmisartan
augmented
GLUT4
protein
expression
and
2-deoxy
glucose
uptake
both
in
basal
and
insulin-stimulated
state
of
adipocytes
,
which
may
contribute
,
at
least
partly
,
to
its
insulin-sensitizing
ability
.
Cancer

previously
demonstrated
that

the
potential
of
Lig
and
RAS
to
restore
Nrf2
gene
expression
through
epigenetic
modification
in
TRAMP
C1
cells
.

Lig
and
RAS
induced
the
mRNA
and
protein
expression
of
endogenous
Nrf2
and
Nrf2
downstream
target
genes
,
such
as
HO-1
,
NQO1
,
and
UGT1A1
.

Bisulfite
genomic
sequencing
revealed
that
Lig
and
RAS
treatment
decreased
the
level
of
methylation
of
the
first
five
CpGs
of
the
Nrf2
promoter
.

A
methylation
DNA
immunoprecipitation
assay
demonstrated
that
Lig
and
RAS
significantly
decreased
the
relative
amount
of
methylated
DNA
in
the
Nrf2
gene
promoter
region
.

Lig
and
RAS
also
inhibited
DNA
methyltransferase
activity
in
vitro
.

Collectively
,
these
results
suggest
that
Lig
and
RAS
are
able
to
demethylate
the
Nrf2
promoter
CpGs
,
resulting
in
the
re-expression
of
Nrf2
and
Nrf2
target
genes
.

Epigenetic
modifications
of
genes
,
including
Nrf2
,
may
therefore
contribute
to
the
overall
health
benefits
of
RAS
,
including
the
anticancer
effect
of
RAS
and
its
bioactive
component
,
Lig
.
In
the
present
study
,
we
have
used
salmon
embryos
whose
continuous
exposure
to
waterborne
PFOA
or
PFOS
at
100
μg
/
L
started
as
freshly
fertilized
eggs
,
and
lasted
for
a
total
of
52
days
.

PFOS
and
PFOA
were
dissolved
in
methanol
(
carrier
vehicle
)
whose
concentration
never
exceeded
0

of

Samples
were
collected
at

21
,
28
,
35
,
52
,
49
and
56
after
the
start
of
the
exposure
.

Note
that
days
49
and
56
represent
end
of
exposure
and
1
week
after
a
recovery
period
,
respectively
.

Tissue

were
determined
by
HPLC
/
MS

MS
,
steroid

,
fatty

(
FAs
)
and
lipids
were
determined
by
GC-MS
,
while
mRNA
expression
levels
of
genes
were
determined
by
qPCR
in
whole
body
homogenate
.

We
observed
that
PFOS
and
PFOA
showed
a
steady
increase
in
whole
body
burden
during
the
exposure
period
,
with
a
slight
decrease
after
the
recovery
period
.

Calculated
somatic
indexes
showed
that
PFOA
produced
increases
in
heart-
,
thymus-
,
liver-
and
kidney
somatic
indexes
(
HSI
,
TSI
,
LSI
and
KSI
)
.

PFOA
and
PFOS
exposure
produced
significant
decreases
in
whole
body
dehydroepiandrosterone
(
DHEA
)
,
estrone
and
testosterone
at
sampling
day
21
and
a
strong
increase
of
cortisol
and
cholesterol
at
the
end
of
recovery
period
(
day
56
)
.

PFOA
and
PFOS
effects
differed
with
DHEA
and
estrone
.

While
PFOS
decreased
DHEA
levels
,
PFOA
produced
an
increase
at
day
49
,
and
while
PFOS
decreased
estrone
,
PFOA
produced
a
slight
increase
at
day
56
.

We
observed
changes
in
FA

that
predominantly
involved
increases
in
FA
methyl
esters
(
FAMEs
)
,
mono-

poly-unsaturated

MUFA
and
PUFA
)
and
a
decrease
in
n-3
/
n-6
PUFA
ratio
by
both
PFOA
and
PFOS
.

,
docosapentaenoic

by
PFOA
and

were
observed
.

These
effects
were
associated
with
changes
in
mRNA

of
FA
elongase
(
FAE
)
,
Δ5-desaturase
(
FAD5
)
and
Δ6-desaturase
(

genes
.

In
summary
,
the
changes
in
hormonal
and

profiles
may
represent
cellular
and

or
physiological
adaptation
to
continuous
PFOS

Considerable
evidence
indicates
that
serotonergic
mechanisms
,
particularly
the
serotonin
transporter
(
5HTT
)
,
may
mediate
central
effects
of
cocaine
and
may
also
be
involved
in
impulsive
and
aggressive
behavior
.

We
investigated
whether
polymorphisms
in
the
5HTT
gene
were
related
to
traits
of
impulsivity
,
sensation
seeking
,
and
aggression
among
cocaine
abusers
.

Standardized
measures
of
these
personality
traits
were
obtained
in
a
sample
of
105
severely
affected
cocaine-dependent
African-American
subjects
and
44
African-American
controls
.

Two
polymorphisms
of
the
5HTT
gene
were
examined
involving
the
5'
promoter
(
5HTTLPR
)
region
and
a
17
base
pair
variable-number-tandem-repeat
(
VNTR
)
marker
among
cocaine
patients
.

No
significant
relationships
were
observed
between
polymorphic
variants
of
the
5HTTLPR
and
VNTR
regions
and
scores
on
any
of
the
trait
measures
.

Similarly
,
demographic
variables
and
measures
of
severity
of
substance
use
and
depression
were
unrelated
to
allele
frequencies
or
genotype
distributions
of
the
variants
among
cocaine
patients
.

As
expected
,
cocaine
patients
scored
significantly
higher
on
total
scores
of
impulsivity
,
aggression
,
and
sensation
seeking
compared
to
controls
.

The
findings
do
not
seem
to
support
an
association
between
these
polymorphisms
in
the
5HTT
gene
and
impulsive-aggressive
traits
among
cocaine-dependent
African-American
individuals
.

The
selenoprotein
phospholipid
hydroperoxide
glutathione
peroxidase
(
PHGPx
)
is
present
in
at
least
three
different
isoforms
in
testis
:
as
a
cytosolic
,
as
a
mitochondrial
,
and
as
a
nuclear
protein
.

We
have
recently
shown
that
a
sperm
nucleus-specific
glutathione
peroxidase
(
snGPx
)
is
identical
to
the
mitochondrial
and
cytosolic
forms
of
PHGPx
apart
from
its
N-terminus
.

This
arginine-rich
N-terminus
of
snGPx
,
reminiscent
of
protamines
,
is
encoded
by
an
alternative
exon
located
in
the
first
intron
of
the
PHGPx
gene
and
is
responsible
for
nuclear
localisation
and
chromatin
binding
of
snGPx

By
using
a
combination
of
techniques
including
selective
cloning
of
mRNA
5'-ends
,
RT-PCR
,
and
S1
analyses
,
we
provide
evidence
that
the
transcript
encoding
the
nuclear
form
is
generated
by
transcription
initiation
at
an
alternative
promoter
and
not
by
alternative
splicing
.

We
show
that
the
major
transcription
start
region
is
located
at
-12
to
-14
upstream
of
the
AUG
translation
initiation
site
of
the
sperm
nucleus-specific
exon
and
lacks
a
TATA
box
.

Two
minor
TATA-less
transcription
initiation
sites
are
located
at
around
-30
and
-45
.

We
have
shown
by
in
situ
hybridisation
that
snGPx
expression
in
testis
,
like
protamine
expression
,
is
restricted
to
late
stages
of
spermatogenesis
whereas
PHGPx
expression
is
only
found
in
spermatocytes
and
early
spermatids
.

These
findings
have
to
be
taken
into
account
when
studying
either
the
differential
regulation
of
PHGPx
and
snGPx
expression
in
testis
or
the
impact
of
putative
mutations
in
snGPx
on
male
fertility

to
be

An
observed

in

gave
rise
to
the
hypothesis
that

might
effect

The
highest

in

was
44%

observed

There
was

O-deethylating
(

)
activity
,
reflecting

,
and

HxCB
had
no
effect
on
female
coagulation
factors
.

In
contrast
,
in
male
rats
only
exposure
to
HxCB
,
which
induces
mainly
CYP2B1
and
2B2
,
decreased
both
coagulation
factors
dramatically
up
to
88%
.

The
LOAEL
of
HxCB
on
factor

in
male
rats
was
100

(

.

In
general
,
effects
on
coagulation
factors
in
male
rats
exceeded
those
in
females
.

In
addition
,
sex-dependent
differences
of
TCDD
and
HxCB
were
observed
on
the
hepatic
vitamin
K
cycle
enzyme
activities
in
female
and
male
rats
.

Vitamin
K-dependent

was
induced

KO-reductase
activity
in
female
rats
was
also
increased
by
TCDD
,
however
,
less
pronounced
than
the
carboxylase
activity
.

Concluding
,
the
hepatic
vitamin
K
cycle
still
functions
and
is
not
blocked
by
TCDD
or
HxCB
,
thus
explaining
the
observed
reduction
in

VII
.

Finally
,
the
possible
role
of
P450
in
vitamin

is
discussed
.

Based

is
suggested
to

the
beta-

gamma-subunit
of
the
amiloride-sensitive
epithelial
sodium

encoded
by
SCNN1B

We
sequenced

In

we
identified
three
missense
mutations

P592S
(
n

,
T594M

and

.

In
the
SCNN1G

,
we
identified
three
missense
mutations
,
A578V
(
n

,
P603S

and
Leu649

)
.

We
did
not
identify
the
same
mutations
previously
reported
in
Liddle's

kindreds
.

Two
of
the
six
hypertensive
patients
with
missense
mutation
in
the
SCNN1B
gene
showed
atypical
renin
and
aldosterone
levels
,
though
one
of
them
was
diagnosed
with
renovascular
hypertension
.

One
patient
with
T594M
in
the
SCNN1B
gene
was
resistant
to
hypertension
.

The
roles
of
these
missense
mutations
in
the
SCNN1B
or
SCNN1G
gene
identified
in
hypertensive
patients
are
not
clear
in
the
pathogenesis
of
hypertension
and
the
regulation
of
electrolytes
.

Thus
,
further
investigation
of
these
mutations
,
including
functional
analyses
,
will
be
needed
.

were
investigated
.

GABAA

subtypes
and

were
expressed
in
Xenopus

.

Modulation
of
GABA-induced
chloride

(
IGABA
)
by
piperine
and
SCT-66
and
activation
of
TRPV1
was
studied
using
the
two-microelectrode-voltage-clamp
technique
and
fast
perfusion
.

Their
effects
on
explorative
behavior
,
thermoregulation
and
seizure

were
analyzed
in
mice
.

Piperine
acted
with
similar
potency
on

subtypes
(

.

IGABA
modulation
by

did
not
require
the
presence
of
a
γ2S-subunit
,
suggesting
a
binding
site
involving
only

IGABA

was
slightly
more
efficacious
on

Replacing
the
piperidine
ring
by
a
N-di-isobutyl
residue
(
SCT-66
)
prevents
interactions
with
TRPV1
and
simultaneously
increases
the
potency
and
efficiency
of
GABAA
receptor
modulation
.

SCT-66
displayed
greater
efficacy
on
GABAA
receptors
than
piperine
,
with
different
subunit-dependence
.

Both
compounds
induced
anxiolytic
,
anticonvulsant
effects
and
reduced
locomotor
activity;
however
,
SCT-66
induced
stronger
anxiolysis
without
decreasing
body
temperature
and
without
the
proconvulsive
effects
of
TRPV1
activation
and
thus
may
serve
as
a
scaffold
for
the
development
of
novel
GABAA

modulators
.
Damaging
of
peripheral
nerves
may
result
in
chronic
neuropathic
pain
for
which
the
likelihood
is
increased
in
the
elderly
.

We
assessed
in
mice
if
age-dependent
alterations
of
endocannabinoids
contributed
to
the
heightened
vulnerability
to
neuropathic
pain
at
old
age
.

We
assessed
nociception
,
endocannabinoids
and
the
therapeutic
efficacy
of
R-flurbiprofen
in
young
and
aged
mice
in
the
spared
nerve
injury
model
of
neuropathic
pain
.

R-flurbiprofen
was
used
because
it
is
able
to
reduce
neuropathic
pain
in
young
mice
in
part
by
increasing
anandamide
.

Aged
mice
developed
stronger
nociceptive
hypersensitivity
after
sciatic
nerve
injury
than
young
mice
.

This
was
associated
with
low
anandamide
levels
in
the
dorsal
root
ganglia
,
spinal
cord
,
thalamus
and
cortex
,
which
further
decreased
after
nerve
injury
.

In
aged
mice
,
R-flurbiprofen
had
only
weak
antinociceptive
efficacy
and
it
failed
to
restore
normal
anandamide
levels
after
nerve
injury
.

In
terms
of
the
mechanisms
,
we
found
that
fatty
acid
amide
hydrolase
(
FAAH
)
which
degrades
anandamide
,
was
upregulated
after
nerve
injury
at
both
ages
,
so
that
this
upregulation
likely
did
not
account
for
the
age-dependent
differences
.

However
,
enzymes
contributing
to
oxidative
metabolism
of
anandamide
,
namely
cyclooxygenase-1
and
Cyp2D6
,
were
increased
in
the
brain
of
aged
mice
,
possibly
enhancing
the
oxidative
breakdown
of
anandamide
.

This
may
overwhelm
the
capacity
of
R-flurbiprofen
to
restore
anandamide
homeostasis
and
may
contribute
to
the
heightened
risk
for
neuropathic
pain
at
old
age
.
Bombesin
receptor
subtype-3
(
BRS-3
)
,
a
novel
candidate
as
therapeutic
molecular
target
in
obesity
and
diabetes
.
BACKGROUND
:
Mutations
in
the
cardiac
sodium
(
Na
)
channel
gene
(
SCN5A
)
give
rise
to
the
congenital
long-QT
syndrome
(
LQT3
)
and
the
Brugada
syndrome
.

Na
channel
blockade
by
antiarrhythmic
drugs
improves
the
QT
interval
prolongation
in
LQT3
but
worsens
the
Brugada
syndrome
ST-segment
elevation
.

Although
Na
channel
blockade
has
been
proposed
as
a
treatment
for
LQT3
,
flecainide
also
evokes
"Brugada-like"
ST-segment
elevation
in
LQT3
patients
.

Here
,
we
examine
how
Na
channel
inactivation
gating
defects
in
LQT3
and
Brugada
syndrome
elicit
proarrhythmic
sensitivity
to
flecainide
.

METHODS
AND
RESULTS
:
We
measured
whole-cell
Na
current
(
I
(
Na
)
)
from
tsA-201
cells
transfected
with
DeltaKPQ
,
a
LQT3
mutation
,
and
1795insD
,
a
mutation
that
provokes
both
the
LQT3
and
Brugada
syndromes
.

The
1795insD
and
DeltaKPQ
channels
both
exhibited
modified
inactivation
gating
(
from
the
closed
state
)
,
thus
potentiating
tonic
I
(
Na
)
block
.

Flecainide

1
micromol

L
)
tonic
block
was
only
16

0%
for
wild
type
but
was
58

0

0%
for
1795insD
(
P<0

)
and
39
.
4
+
/
-8
.
0%
(
P<0
.
05
)
for
DeltaKPQ
.

In
addition
,
the
1795insD
mutation
delayed
recovery
from
inactivation
by
enhancing
intermediate
inactivation
,
with
a
4-fold
delay
in
recovery
from
use-dependent
flecainide
block
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
We
have
linked
2
inactivation
gating
defects
(
"closed-state"
fast
inactivation
and
intermediate
inactivation
)
to
flecainide
sensitivity
in
patients
carrying
LQT3
and
Brugada
syndrome
mutations
.

These
results
provide
a
mechanistic
rationale
for
predicting
proarrhythmic
sensitivity
to
flecainide
based
on
the
identification
of
specific
SCN5A
inactivation
gating
defects
.

We
have
examined
the
rapid
development
of
synaptic
transmission
at
the
neuromuscular
junction
(
NMJ
)
in
zebrafish
embryos
and
larvae
by
patch-clamp
recording
of
spontaneous
miniature
endplate
currents
(
mEPCs
)
and
single
acetylcholine
receptor
(
AChR
)
channels
.

Embryonic
(
24-36
h
)
mEPCs
recorded
in
vivo
were
small
in
amplitude
(
<50
pA
)
.

The
rate
of
mEPCs
increased
in
larvae
(
3
.
5-fold
increase
measured
by
6
days
)
,
and
these
mEPCs
were
mostly
of
larger
amplitude
(
10-fold
on
average
)
with
(
<
/
=
5-fold
)
faster
kinetics
.

Intracellular
labeling
with
Lucifer
yellow
indicated
extensive
coupling
between
muscle
cells
in
both
embryos
and
larvae
(
<
/
=
10
days
)
.

Blocking
acetylcholinesterase
(
AChE
)
with
eserine
had
no
effect
on
mEPC
kinetics
in
embryos
at
1
day
and
only
partially
slowed
(
by
approximately
1
/
2
)
the
decay
rate
in
larvae
at
6
days
.

In
acutely
dissociated
muscle
cells
,
we
observed
the
same
two
types
of
AChR
with
conductances
of
45
and
60
pS
and
with
similar
,
brief
(
<0
.
5
ms
)
mean
open
times
in
both
embryos
and
larvae
.

We
conclude
that
AChR
properties
are
set
early
during
development
at
these
early
stages;
functional
maturation
of
the
NMJ
is
only
partly
shaped
by
expression
of
AChE
and
may
also
depend
on
postsynaptic
AChR
clustering
and
presynaptic
maturation
.
Abstract

Upamostat
(
Mesupron®
)
is
a
new
small
molecule
serine
protease
inhibitor
.

The
drug
candidate
was
developed
to
inhibit
the
urokinase-type
plasminogen
activator
(
uPA
)
system
,
which
plays
a
major
role
in
tumor
invasion
and
metastasis
.

Upamostat
is
currently
in
clinical
development
as
an
anti-metastatic
and
non-cytotoxic
agent
against
pancreatic
and
breast
cancer
.

Upamostat
is

available
amidoxime-
(
i

hydroxyamidine-
)
prodrug
of
the
pharmacologically
active
form
,
WX-UK1
.

In
this
study
,
the
reductive
enzymatic
activation
of
upamostat
to
its
corresponding
amidine
WX-UK1
was
analyzed
.

.

The
recently
discovered
molybdenum
enzyme
"mitochondrial
Amidoxime
Reducing
Component"
(
mARC
)
catalyses
together
with
its
electron
transport
proteins
cytochrome
b
(
5
)
and
NADH
cytochrome
b
(
5
)
reductase
the
reduction
of
N-hydroxylated
prodrugs
.

In

Inflammatory
reactions
play
an
important
role
in
ischemia
/
reperfusion
injury
in
various
organs
.

Since
histamine
is
closely
related
to
inflammatory
reactions
and
immune
responses
,
effects
of
postischemic
administration
of
histaminergic
ligands
on
ischemia-induced
liver
injury
were
examined
in
rats
.

Animals
were
subjected
to
warm
ischemia
for
30
min
by
occlusion
of
the
left
portal
vein
and
hepatic
artery
under
halothane
anesthesia
,
and
liver
damage
was
evaluated
by
assessing
plasma
concentrations
of
transaminases
after
24
h
.

Warm
ischemia
for
30
min
provoked
severe
liver
damage
after
24
h
,
and
the
plasma
concentrations
of
alanine
transaminase
(
ALT
)
and
aspartate
transaminase
(
AST
)
were
8600
I
.

U
.

/
l
and
13100
I
.

U
.

/
l
,
respectively
.

Subcutaneous
injections
of
histamine
twice
,
immediately
and
6
h
after
reperfusion
(
20
mg
/
kg
,
each
)
,
alleviated
liver
damage
.

The
plasma
concentrations
of
ALT
and
AST
in
the
histamine
group
were
35%
and
24%
of
those
in
the
control
group
,
respectively
.

Neither
mepyramine
(
3
mg
/
kg
x
2
)
,
an
H1
antagonist
,
nor
cimetidine
(
15
mg
/
kg
x
2
)
,
an
H2
antagonist
,
affected
the
outcome
in
histamine-treated
rats
.

However
,
thioperamide
(
5
mg
/
kg
x
2
)
,
an
H3
/
H4
antagonist
,
completely
abolished
the
alleviation
caused
by
histamine
.

Administration
of
dimaprit
(
1-10
mg
/
kg
x
2
)
,
an
H2
/
H4
agonist
,
mimicked
the
protective
effect
of
histamine
,
and
the
effect
of
dimaprit
is
reversed
by
thioperamide
,
whereas
neither
H1
nor
H2
antagonists
altered
the
outcome
caused
by
dimaprit
.

Clozapine
(
15
mg
/
kg
x
2
)
,
an
H4
agonist
,
also
mimicked
the
protective
effect
of
histamine
.

These
findings
indicate
that
stimulation
of
histamine
H4
receptors
after
ischemic
events
prevents
development
of
reperfusion
injury
in
the
liver
.
Effects
and

of
organ

cardiotrophin-1
.
Left
ventricular
noncompaction
(
LVNC
)
and
low
mitochondrial
membrane
potential
are
specific
for
Barth
syndrome
.
Here
,
we
show
that
the
synaptic
vesicle
protein
SV2A
is
the
brain
binding
site
of
levetiracetam
(
LEV
)
,
a
new
antiepileptic
drug
with
a
unique
activity
profile
in
animal
models
of
seizure
and
epilepsy
.

The
LEV-binding
site
is
enriched
in
synaptic
vesicles
,
and
photoaffinity
labeling
of
purified
synaptic
vesicles
confirms
that
it
has
an
apparent
molecular
mass
of
approximately
90
kDa
.

Brain
membranes
and
purified
synaptic
vesicles
from
mice
lacking
SV2A
do
not
bind
a
tritiated
LEV
derivative
,
indicating
that
SV2A
is
necessary
for
LEV
binding
.

LEV
and
related
compounds
bind
to
SV2A
expressed
in
fibroblasts
,
indicating
that
SV2A
is
sufficient
for
LEV
binding
.

No
binding
was
observed
to
the
related
isoforms
SV2B
and
SV2C
.

Furthermore
,
there
is
a
high
degree
of
correlation
between
binding
affinities
of
a
series
of
LEV
derivatives
to
SV2A
in
fibroblasts
and
to
the
LEV-binding
site
in
brain
.

Finally
,
there
is
a
strong
correlation
between
the
affinity
of
a
compound
for
SV2A
and
its
ability
to
protect
against
seizures
in
an
audiogenic
mouse
animal
model
of
epilepsy
.

These
experimental
results
suggest
that
SV2A
is
the
binding
site
of
LEV
in
the
brain
and
that
LEV
acts
by
modulating
the
function
of
SV2A
,
supporting
previous
indications
that
LEV
possesses
a
mechanism
of
action
distinct
from
that
of
other
antiepileptic
drugs
.

Further
,
these
results
indicate
that
proteins
involved
in
vesicle
exocytosis
,
and
SV2
in
particular
,
are
promising
targets
for
the
development
of
new
CNS
drug
therapies
.

This
work
demonstrates
a
novel
multifunctional
nanofibrous
mat
for
photocatalytic
applications
based
on
TiO2
nanocables
functionalized
by
Ag
nanoparticles
and
coated
with
a
thin
(
∼2
nm
)
graphitic
shell
.

In
this
mat
,
which
was
realized
by
an
electrospinning
technique
,
each
component
serves
a
unique
function
:
the
carbon
coating
acts
as
both
an
adsorption
material
for
capturing
pollutants
and
as
a
charge-transfer
material
,
the
Ag
nanoparticles
act
as
a
visible-light
sensitizing
agent
and
also
as
a
charge-transfer
material
,
finally
the
TiO2
nanocable
mat
acts
as
a
UV
sensitive
photocatalytic
matrix
and
as
the
flexible
substrate
for
the
other
functional
components
.

This
multicomponent
nanocable
mat
exhibits
excellent
photocatalytic
activity
under
simulated
solar
irradiation
for
the
degradation
of
model
pollutants
including
RhB
and
phenol
.

The
significant
photocatalytic
properties
are
attributed
to
the
synergetic
effect
of
the
three
functional
components
and
the
unique
charge
transport
"freeway"
property
of
the
nanofibrous
mat
.

In
addition
,
the
porous
carbon
coating
infiltrated
into
the
nanocable
matrix
endows
the
mat
with
excellent
flexibility
and
enables
robust
,
large-area
(
10
×
10
cm
)
fabrication
,
representing
a
significant
advantage
over
previous
brittle
ceramic

substrates
.

This
study
provides
new
insight
into
the
design
and
preparation
of
an
advanced
,
yet

practical
and
scaleable

composite
membrane
material
.

The
as-prepared

might
also
be

in

,

Antiherpes
therapies
are
principally
targeted
at
viral
thymidine

utilize
nucleoside

,
the
triphosphates
of
which
are
inhibitors
of
viral

The
most

,
aciclovir

a
relatively
poor
substrate
for
thymidine
kinase
and
high-resolution
structural
information

FAK
is
a
tyrosine
kinase
that
functions
as
a
key
orchestrator
of
signals
leading
to
invasion
and
metastasis
.

Since
FAK
interacts
directly
with
a
number
of
critical
proteins
involved
in
survival
signaling
in
tumor
cells
,
we
hypothesized
that
targeting
a

druglike
small

was
a
feasible
strategy
for
inhibiting

In

we
targeted

Melatonin
is
an
indole
hormone
produced
mainly
by
the
pineal
gland
.

We
have
previously
demonstrated
that
melatonin
interferes
with
estrogen
(
E
(
2
)
)
signaling
in
MCF7
cells
by
impairing
estrogen
receptor
(
ER
)
pathways
.

Here
we
present
the
characterization
of
its
mechanism
of
action
showing
that
melatonin
is
a
specific
inhibitor
of
E
(
2
)
-induced
ERalpha-mediated
transcription
in
both
estrogen
response
element-
and
AP1-containing
promoters
,
whereas
ERbeta-mediated
transactivation
is
not
inhibited
or
even
activated
at
certain
promoters
.

We
show
that
the
sensitivity
of
MCF-7
cells
to
melatonin
depends
on
the
ERalpha
/
ERbeta
ratio
,
and
ectopic
expression
of
ERbeta
results
in
MCF-7
cells
becoming
insensitive
to
this
hormone
.

Melatonin
acts
as
a
calmodulin
antagonist
inducing
conformational
changes
in
the
ERalpha-calmodulin
(
CaM
)
complex
,
thus
impairing
the
binding
of
E
(
2
)
.

ERalpha
.

CaM
complex
to
DNA
and
,
therefore
,
preventing
ERalpha-dependent
transcription
.

Moreover
the
mutant
ERalpha
(
K302G
,
K303G
)
,
unable
to
bind
calmodulin
,
becomes
insensitive
to
melatonin
.

The
effect
of
melatonin
is
specific
since
other
related
indoles
neither
interact
with
CaM
nor
inhibit
ERalpha-mediated
transactivation
.

Interestingly
,
melatonin
does
not
affect
the
binding
of
coactivators
to
ERalpha
,
indicating
that
melatonin
action
is
different
from
that
of
current
therapeutic
anti-estrogens
used
in
breast
cancer
therapy
.

Thus
,
they
target
ERalpha
at
different
levels
,
representing
two
independent
ways
to
control
ERalpha
activity
.

It
is
,
therefore
,
conceivably
a
synergistic
pharmacological
effect
of
melatonin
and
current
anti-estrogen
drugs
.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL
RELEVANCE
:
Rokumi-jio-gan-containing
prescriptions
,
traditional
medicine
,
are
widely
used
to
treat
renal
dysfunction
in
Japan
.

AIM
OF
THE
STUDY
:
The
present
study
was
conducted
to
examine
whether
two
Rokumi-jio-
gan-containing
prescriptions
(
Hachimi-jio-gan
and
Bakumi-jio-gan
)
have
an
ameliorative
effect
on
dyslipidemia
in
nephrectomized
rats
.

MATERIALS
AND
METHODS
:
Each
prescription
was
orally
administered
to
nephrectomized
rats
at
150mg
/
kg
body
weight
per
day
for
10
weeks
,
and
its
effect
was
compared
with
vehicle-treated
nephrectomized
rats
.

RESULTS
:
Rats
given
Hachimi-jio-gan
and
Bakumi-jio-gan
showed
an
improvement
of
renal
functional
parameters
such
as
serum
urea
nitrogen
,
creatinine
,
creatinine
clearance
,
and
urinary
protein
.

The
increased

and

levels
in
serum
,
and
triglyceride
and
total
cholesterol
contents
in
the
kidney
of
nephrectomized
rats
were
significantly
decreased
by
Hachimi-jio-gan
and
Bakumi-jio-gan
administration
.

Furthermore
,
Hachimi-jio-gan
acts
as
a
regulator
of
peroxisome
proliferator-activated
receptor
α
,
sterol
regulatory
element
binding
protein
(
SREBP
)

,
and
SREBP-2
.

On
the
contrary
,
the
increased
reactive
oxygen
species
and
thiobarbituric
acid-reactive
substance
were
decreased
,
while
superoxide
dismutase
and
the
reduced
glutathione
/
oxidized
glutathione
ratio
were
augmented
by
Hachimi-jio-gan
rather
than
Bakumi-jio-gan
.

was
marked
in
the
group
administered
Bakumi-jio-gan
.

However
,
oil

O
staining
showed
that
the
increased
lipid
deposition
in
the
kidney
of
nephrectomized
rats
improved
on
Hachimi-jio-gan
and
Bakumi-jio-gan
administration
.

CONCLUSION
:
This
study
provides
scientific
evidence
that
two
Rokumi-jio-gan-containing
prescriptions
(
Hachimi-jio-gan
and
Bakumi-jio-gan
)
improves
oxidative
stress
via
dyslipidemia
in
the
remnant
kidney
of
nephrectomized
rats
.
Cigarette
smoking
causes
cellular
oxidative
stress
resulting
in
inflammatory
diseases
of
lung
wherein
transcription
factor
NF-κB
plays
an
important
role
.

It
is
possible
that
vitamin
C
,
an
antioxidant
,
may
prevent
cigarette
smoke
(
CS
)
-induced
NF-κB
activation
that
involves
degradation
of
I-κBε
and
nuclear
translocation
of
c-Rel
/
p50
in
alveolar
epithelial
cells
.

Therefore
,
to
examine
the
hypothesis
,
we
verified
the
effect
of
vitamin
C
on
CS-induced
expression
of
NF-κB
driven
luciferase
reporter
and
NF-κB
binding
at
its
target
DNA
by
EMSA
in
alveolar
epithelial
A549
cells
.

We
also
examined
the
level
of
I-κBε
and
sub-cellular
distribution
of
c-Rel
by
western
blotting
and
immunofluorescence
respectively
in
CSE-treated
A549
cells
with
or
without
vitamin
C
pretreatment
.

We
observed
a
significant
reduction
in
CSE
induced
luciferase
expression
,
NF-κB
DNA
binding
,
I-κBε
degradation
and
c-Rel
nuclear
translocation
in
cells
pretreated
with
vitamin
C
.

To
further
validate
the
result
,
we
examined
sub-cellular
distribution
of
c-Rel
in
lungs
of
CS-exposed
guinea
pigs
treated
or
untreated
with
vitamin
C
.

Result
showed
that
vitamin
C
treatment
resulted
in
markedly
reduced
c-Rel
nuclear
translocation
.

All
these
results
demonstrate
that
vitamin
C
prevents
CS
(
E
)
-induced
NF-κB
activation
and
thus
it
could
be
used
for
the
prevention
of
CS-induced
inflammatory
diseases
.

Using

we
demonstrated
that

is
a
structural
appendage
that
folds
back
to
the

About
a
third
of
acromegalic
patients
are
resistant
to
the
currently
commercially
available
somatostatin
analogs
(
SA
)
octreotide
and
lanreotide
.

Such
resistance
is
related
to
an
overall
reduction
of
somatostatin
receptor
(
SSTR
)
density
or
to
a
differentiated
expression
of
SSTR
subtypes
.

There
are
five
known
SSTR
subtypes
.

SSTR2
and
SSTR5
are
usually
expressed
in
GH-secreting
pituitary
tumors
,
and
both
octreotide
and
lanreotide
bind
preferentially
to
SSTR2
and
,
to
a
lesser
extent
,
to
SSTR5
.

SA
inhibitory
effects
on
GH
secretion
and
tumor
cell
proliferation
can
occur
together
or
be
dissociated
events
,
depending
on
the
tumor
expression
of
SSTR
subtypes
involved
in
each
mechanism
.

The
development
of
specific
somatostatin
subtypes
analogs
,
mainly
for
SSTR5
,
of
a
SSTR2-SSTR5
bispecific
compound
,
and
of

DNA
polymerase
is
one
of
the
most
important
target
molecules
of
antitumor
agents
,
especially
for
antimetabolite
nucleosides
that
include
1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine
(
araC
)
and
2'-deoxy-2'
,
2'-difluorocytidine
(
gemcitabine
)
.

There
are
several
subtypes
of
mammalian
DNA
polymerases
and
their
localization
and
function
have
been
clarified
.

DNA
polymerase
alpha
,
delta
and
epsilon
have
been
implicated
to
be
responsible
for
DNA
replication
,
whereas
DNA
polymerase
beta
,
delta
and
epsilon
have
been
suggested
to
work
in
DNA
repair
.

DNA
polymerase
gamma
is
encoded
in
the
nucleus
but
localizes
in
the
mitochondria
,
and
is
responsible
for
the
mitochondrial
DNA
replication
.

Recently
,
several
antiviral
nucleoside
analogs
were
reported
to
inhibit
DNA
polymerase
gamma
after
intracellular
phosphorylation
and
cause
severe
chronic
toxicity
.

1-
(
2-Deoxy-2-fluoro-4-thio-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl
)
cytosine
(
4'-thio-FAC
)
,
an
antimetabolite
similar
to
araC
and
gemcitabine
,
is
recently
shown
by
us
to
be
a
very
promising
agent
because
of
its
potent
antitumor
activity
by
oral
administration
to
mice
.

We
tested
for
the
inhibitory
activities
of
the
triphosphates
of
4'-thio-FAC
and
gemcitabine
against
DNA
polymerase
alpha
,
beta
and
gamma
.

The
triphosphates
of
4'-thio-FAC
(
4'-thio-FACTP
)
exhibited
the
potent
inhibitory
action
against
DNA
polymerase
alpha
,
whereas
it
showed
moderate
inhibition
against
DNA
polymerase
beta
and
little
inhibition
against
DNA
polymerase
gamma
.

The
triphosphate
of
gemcitabine
(
dFdCTP
)
did
not
show
potent
inhibition
against
these
three
DNA
polymerases
.

Thus
,
the
effect
on
ribonucleotide
reductase
was
suggested
to
be
more
responsible
for
the
antitumor
action
of
gemcitabine
.

The
differences
in
the
mechanisms
of
action
against
DNA
polymerases
between
these
drugs
and
other
nucleosides
were
also
discussed
.
Besides
their
antiviral
activity
,
type
I
Interferons
(
IFN
)
display
context-specific
immunomodulation
.

In
contrast
to
long-known
IFNα
/
β
,
Interleukin
(
IL
)
-22
is
an
anti-bacterial
,
largely
tissue
protective
cytokine
that
recently
gained
attention
.

Herein
,
cellular
IFNα
/
IL-22
interactions
are
investigated
.

We
report
that
pre-conditioning
of
epithelial
cells
with
IFNα
initiated
dramatic
changes
in
IL-22
signaling
normally
dominated
by
signal
transducer
and
activator
of
transcription
(
STAT
)
-3
.

Specifically
,
by
using
human
DLD1
colon
epithelial
/
carcinoma
cells
we
demonstrate
that
,
upon
IFNα
,
IL-22
converts
into
a
cytokine
robustly
activating
STAT1
and
its
downstream
pro-inflammatory
targets
CXCL9
,
CXCL10
,
and
inducible
nitric
oxide
synthase
(
iNOS
)
.

Accordingly
,
only
after
IFNα
pre-incubation
was
IL-22-induced
STAT1
binding
to
the
CXCL10
promoter
detectable
.

Using
the
viral
mimic
polyinosinic
:
polycytidylic
acid
and
the
IFNα
/
β
antagonist
B18R
we
furthermore
demonstrate
the
capability
of
endogenous
IFN
to
promote
IL-22-induced
STAT1
activation
and
expression
of
CXCL10
.

IL-22-induced
STAT1
activation
subsequent
to
IFNα
priming
became
likewise
apparent
in
human
Caco2
colon
epithelial
/
carcinoma
cells
,
HepG2
hepatoma
cells
,
and
primary
keratinocytes
.

Current
observations
may
relate
to
characteristics
of
IFNα

β
in
clinical
therapy
and
expose

The
G
protein
coupled
receptor
55
(
GPR55
)
is
a
lysophosphatidylinositol
(
LPI
)
receptor
that
is
also
responsive
to
certain
cannabinoids
.

Although
GPR55
has
been
implicated
in
several
(
patho
)
physiological
functions
,
its
role
is
still
enigmatic
mainly
owing
to
the
lack
of
selective
GPR55
antagonists
.

Here
we
show
that
the
compound
CID16020046
(
(

is
a

.

In
yeast
cells
expressing

CID16020046
antagonized

In
HEK293
cells
stably
expressing
human
GPR55
(
HEK-GPR55
)
,
the
compound
behaved
as
an
antagonist
on
LPI-mediated
Ca2

release
and
extracellular
signal-regulated

(

activation
,
but
not
in
HEK293
cells
expressing
cannabinoid
receptor

or

(
CB1
or

.

CID16020046
concentration-dependently
inhibited
LPI-induced
activation
of
nuclear

It
reduced

and
reversed

platelet
aggregation
,
suggesting
a
novel
role
for
GPR55
in

CID16020046

therefore
a
valuable
tool
to

BACKGROUND
:
Retinoid
research
in
the
field
of
dermatology
has
been
influenced
by
the
clinical
success
of
topical
tretinoin
and
oral
isotretinoin
in
the
treatment
of
acne
,
and
by
the
discovery
of
high-affinity
binding
proteins
for
retinoic
acid
mediating
its
action
and
interaction
with
other
vitamins
and
hormones
.

OBJECTIVE
:
We
sought
molecules
with
an
optimal
balance
between
stability
,
efficacy
,
and
local
tolerance
for
topical
acne
therapy
.

METHODS
:
In
vitro
and
in
vivo
bioassay
systems
were
used
to
test
the
ability
of
retinoids
to
modulate
cell
proliferation
and
differentiation
.

In
addition
,
antiinflammatory
properties
were
assessed
.

Binding
and
transactivation
assays
were
used
to
compare
affinities
and
transcriptional
activities
of
adapalene
and
tretinoin
for
the
nuclear
transcription
factors
,
retinoic
acid
receptors
(
RARs
)
.

RESULTS
AND
CONCLUSION
:
Adapalene
is
a
stable
naphthoic
acid
derivative
with
potent
retinoid
pharmacology
,
controlling
cell
proliferation
and
differentiation
.

In
addition
it
has
significant
antiinflammatory
action
.

The
nuclear
gene
transcription
factors
RAR
beta
and
RAR
gamma
mediate
the
retinoid
activity
of
adapalene
.
The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
examine
the
antitumour
activity
of
resveratrol
in
human
colorectal
cancer
cell
lines
(
HCT116
and
Caco2
)
and
to
explore
its
mechanism
of
action
assuming
that
it
is
by
calorie-restriction
effect
.

Resveratrol
inhibited
the
proliferation
of
colon
cancer
cells
with
half
maximal
inhibitory
concentration
(
IC50
)
equal
to
50
and
130
μM
for
HCT116
and
Caco2
,
respectively
.

Caco2
cells
appeared
with
significant
time-dependent
increase
in
the
glycolytic
pathway
,
a
behaviour
that
was
absent
in
HCT116
cells
.

Resveratrol
(
100
μM
)
significantly
decreased
the
glycolytic
enzymes
(
pyruvate
kinase
and
lactate
dehydrogenase
)
in
Caco2
cells
,
while
an
increase
in
citrate
synthase
activity
and
a
decrease
in
glucose
consumption
were
observed
in
both
cell
lines
.

Moreover
,
resveratrol
downregulated
the
expressions
of
leptin
and
c-Myc
,
and
decreased
the
content
of
vascular
endothelial
growth
factor
.

The
apoptotic
markers
,
caspases
3
and
8
,
were
activated
and
the
Bax
/
BCl2
ratio
was
increased
.

The
study
suggested
a
promising
anticancer
activity
of
resveratrol
,
calorie-restriction
pathway
may
be
one
of
the
driving
forces
for
this
activity
.

Zearalenone
(
ZEN
)
and
its
metabolites
are
commonly
found
in
many
food
commodities
and
are
known
to
cause
reproductive
disorders
and
genotoxic
effects
.

The
major
ZEN
metabolites
are
α-zearalenol
(
α-ZOL
)
and
β-zearalenol
(
β-ZOL
)
.

Although
many
studies
have
demonstrated
the
cytotoxic
effects
of
these
metabolites
,
the
mechanisms
by
which
α-ZOL
or
β-ZOL
mediates
their
cytotoxic
effects
appear
to
differ
according
to
cell
type
and
the
exposed
toxins
.

We
evaluated
the
toxicity
of
α-ZOL
and
β-ZOL
on
RAW264
.
7
macrophages
and
investigated
the
underlying
mechanisms
.

β-ZOL
not
only
more
strongly
reduced
the
viability
of
cells
than
did
α-ZOL
,
but
it
also
induced
cell
death
mainly
by
apoptosis
rather
than
necrosis
.

The
ZEN
metabolites
induced
loss
of
mitochondrial
membrane
potential
(
MMP
)
,
mitochondrial
changes
in
Bcl-2
and
Bax
proteins
,
and
cytoplasmic
release
of
cytochrome
c
and
apoptosis-inducing
factor
(
AIF
)
.

Use
of
an
inhibitor
specific
to
c-Jun
N-terminal
kinase
(
JNK
)
,
p38
kinase
or
p53
,
but
not
pan-caspase
or
caspase-8
,
decreased
the
toxin-induced
generation
of
reactive
oxygen
species
(
ROS
)
and
also
attenuated
the
α-ZOL-
or
β-ZOL-induced
decrease
of
cell
viability
.

Antioxidative
enzyme
or
compounds
such
as
catalase
,
acteoside
,
and
(
E
)
-1-
(
3
,
4-dihydroxyphenethyl
)
-3-
(
4-hydroxystyryl
)
urea
suppressed
the
ZEN
metabolite-mediated
reduction
of
cell
viability
.

Further
,
knockdown
of
AIF
via
siRNA
transfection
diminished
the
ZEN
metabolite-induced
cell
death
.

Collectively
,
these
results
suggest
that
the
activation
of
p53
,
JNK
or
p38
kinase
by
ZEN
metabolites
is
the
main
upstream
signal
required
for
the
mitochondrial
alteration
of
Bcl-2
/
Bax
signaling
pathways
and
intracellular
ROS
generation
,
while
MMP
loss
and
nuclear
translocation
of
AIF
are
the
critical
downstream
events
for
ZEN
metabolite-mediated
apoptosis
in
macrophages
.
In

We

.

Clonidine-evoked

decreases
were
comparable
in

and
in
alpha-2CDel

subjects
,
but
significantly
lower
(
P

)
in

.

Similarly
,
clonidine-evoked
HR
decreases
were
significantly
larger
in
young
WT
alpha-2C
and
in
alpha-2CDel
AR
subjects
than
in
elder
subjects
,
whereas
clonidine-evoked
BP
decreases
were
larger
in
elder
subjects
.

In
conclusion
,
alpha-2CDel
AR
appears
to
play
only
a
minor
role
in
presynaptic
regulation
of
NA
release
and

The

the

It

whether
ethanol
(

)
modifies
the
damaging

of

(

)
on
bone
metabolism
in
a
rat
model
reflecting
excessive
alcohol
consumption
by
humans
exposed
to
relatively
high
levels
of
this
metal
.

For
this
purpose
,

(

)
and

,
and
the
femur
content
of
mineral
(
including
calcium

and
inorganic
phosphorus
-
Pi
)
and
organic
components
were
estimated
in
the
rats
exposed
to
500mg
Pb

(
in

)
or
/
and
Et
(

/

,

)
for
12weeks
.

Moreover
,
Ca
and
Pi
in
the
serum
and
urine
,
alkaline
phosphatase
in
the
bone
tissue
and
Pb
in
the
blood
and
femur
were
determined
.

The
exposure
to
Pb
or
/
and
Et
decreased
bone
formation
and
increased
its
resorption
resulting
in
the
bone
demineralization
.

These
effects
were
accompanied
by
destroying
the
hormonal
regulation
of
mineral
metabolism
,
and
Ca
and
Pi
imbalance
.

The
co-exposure
to
Pb
and
Et-induced
disorders
in
bone
metabolism
were
more
advanced
than
those
caused
by
Pb
alone
.

Et
co-administration
increased
Pb
concentration
in
the
blood
and
decreased
its
accumulation
in
the
bone
.

This
paper
is
the
first
report
providing
evidence
that
consumption
of
Et
under
exposure
to
Pb
intensifies
disorders
in
bone
metabolism
and
that
destroying
of
the
receptor
activator
nuclear
factor-κB
(
RANK
)
/
RANK
ligand
/
osteoprotegerin
system
is
involved
in
the
mechanisms
of
interactive
action
of
these
xenobiotics
on
the
skeleton
.

The
modifying
impact
of
Et
may
be
an
effect
of
its
independent
osteotropic
action
and
interaction
with
Pb
.

Based
on
the
results
it
can
be
concluded
that
alcohol
abuse
by
subjects
excessively
exposed
to
Pb
considerably
increases
the
risk
of
bone
damage
.

N-terminal
region

Supporting
functional
significance
of
this
interaction
,
both
the
Rev1
pathway
and
Rad5
are
required
for
translesion
synthesis
and
mutagenesis
of

,
N

-ethenoadenine
.

Furthermore
,
disrupting
the
Rev1-Rad5
interaction
by
mutating
Rev1
did
not
affect
its
dCMP
transferase
,
but
led
to
inactivation
of
the
Rev1
non-catalytic
function
in
translesion
synthesis
of
UV-induced
DNA
damage
.

Deletion
analysis
revealed
that
the
C-terminal
21-amino
acid
sequence
of
Rev1
is
uniquely
required
for
its
interaction
with
Rad5
and
is
essential
for
its
non-catalytic
function
.

Deletion
analysis
additionally
implicated
a
C-terminal
region
of
Rev1
in
its
negative
regulation
.

These
results
show
that
a
non-catalytic
function
of
Rev1
in
translesion
synthesis
and
mutagenesis
is
mediated
by
its
interaction
with
Rad5
.

Our
previous
studies
revealed
that
gambogic
acid
(
GA
)
,
the
major
active
ingredient
of
gamboge
,
possessed
antiangiogenic
activities
.

In
this
study
,
we
further
explored
the
mechanism
of
inhibition
effects
of
GA
in
tumor
angiogenesis
.

The
results
of
luciferase
,
RT-PCR
,
and
ELISA
assays
indicated
that
GA
significantly
decreased
transcription
activation
,
mRNA
expression
,
and
secretion
of
VEGF
in
hypoxia
.

We
detected
that
GA
had
no
effect
on
mRNA
level
of
HIF-1α
which
targets
VEGF
gene
,
but
the
increase
of
HIF-1α
protein
expression
in
hypoxia
was
repressed
by
GA
,
which
can
be
reversed
by
proteasomal
inhibitor
MG132
and
siRNA
of
VHL
.

But
GA
exhibited
no
effect
on
expression
of
VHL
both
in
normoxia
and
hypoxia
.

HIF
prolyl
hydroxylases
(
PHD
enzymes

act

Our
results
showed
that
GA
potentially
enhanced
level
of
PHD2
,
the
most
important
HIF
hydroxylase
,
and
showed
no
effect
on
PHD1
and
PHD3
.

Transient
transfection
of

Growth

accompanied
with
decrease
of
HIF-1α
and

This
work
provides
the
demonstration
that
GA
shows
anti-angiogenic
effects
via
inhibiting

We
have
previously
demonstrated
that
the
beta
2-adrenoceptor
agonist
,
salbutamol
,
potentiates
the
effect
of
interleukin-4
(
IL-4
)
on
immunoglobulin
E
(
IgE
)
production
by
human
peripheral
blood
mononuclear
cells
(
PBMC
)
.

This
study
was
undertaken
to
further
define
the
activities
of
these
drugs
and
the
role
of
cyclic-adenosine
monophosphate
(
cAMP
)
in
the
modulation
of
IgE
production
.

Our
results
indicate
that
fenoterol
(
1
microM
)
potentiated
IL-4-induced
IgE
production
and
IgE
messenger
ribonucleic
acid
(
mRNA
)
expression
.

Moreover
,
this
effect
was
associated
with
an
increase
in
intracellular
cAMP
levels
.

The
activities
of
this
drug
on
IgE
production
were
mimicked
by
cell
permeable
cAMP
analogues
,
such
as
dibutyryl-cAMP
(
db-cAMP
)
(
100
microM
)
or
Sp-AMP
(
10
microM
)
.

The
potentiating
effect
of
fenoterol
on
IgE
production
was
markedly
inhibited
in
the
presence
of
protein
kinase
A
(
PKA
)
inhibitors
:
H8
(
10
microM
)
and
Rp-AMP
(
10
microM
)
,
suggesting
that
its
effects
are
likely
to
depend
on
the
activation
of
the
cAMP
pathway
.

Additionally
,
the
potentiating
effect
of
fenoterol
was
also
blocked
in
the
presence
of
indomethacin
.

Fenoterol
potentiated
IL-4-induced
IgE
production
from
purified
B-cells
activated
through
their
CD40
antigen
.

This
effect
was
associated
with
an
increase
in
cellular
viability
.

Therefore
,
the
activities
of
this
drug
on
PBMC
are
likely
to
be
mediated
by
the
activation
of
another
cellular
type
.

Taken
together
,
these
results
show
that
fenoterol
potentiates
the
IL-4-induced
IgE
production
via
the
cAMP
pathway
,
but
that
this
enhancement
could
not
be
explained
by
a
direct
effect
on
B-lymphocytes
.
Recent
findings
have
implicated
the
5-hydroxytryptamine
2B
(
5-HT2B
)
serotonin
receptor
in
mediating
the
heart
valve
fibroplasia
[
valvular
heart
disease
(
VHD
)
]
and
primary
pulmonary
hypertension
observed
in
patients
taking
the
now-banned
appetite
suppressant
fenfluramine
(
Pondimin
,
Redux
)
.

Via
large-scale
,
random
screening
of
a
portion
of
the
receptorome
,
we
have
discovered
that
the
amphetamine
derivative
3
,
4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine
(
MDMA
,
"Ecstasy"
)
and
its
N-demethylated
metabolite
3
,
4-methylenedioxyamphetamine
(
MDA
)
each
preferentially
bind
to
and
activate
human
recombinant
5-HT2B
receptors
.

We
also
demonstrate
that
MDMA
and
MDA
,
like
fenfluramine
and
its
N-deethylated
metabolite
norfenfluramine
,
elicit
prolonged
mitogenic
responses
in
human
valvular
interstitial
cells
via
activation
of
5-HT2B
receptors
.

We
also
report
that
pergolide
and
dihydroergotamine
,
two
drugs
recently
demonstrated
to
induce
VHD
in
humans
,
potently
activate
5-HT2B
receptors
,
thus
validating
this
assay
system
for
its
ability
to
predict
medications
that
might
induce
VHD
.

Our
discovery
that
MDMA
and
a
major
metabolite
,
MDA
,
induce
prolonged
mitogenic
responses
in
vitro
similar
to
those
induced
by
fenfluramine
and
norfenfluramine
in
vivo
(
i
.

e
.

,

interstitial
cell
fibroplasia
)
predict
that
long-term
MDMA
use
could
lead
to
the
development
of
fenfluramine-like
VHD
.

Because
of
the
widespread
abuse
of
MDMA
,
these
findings
have
major
public
health
implications
.

These
findings
also
underscore
the
necessity
of
screening
current
and
future
drugs
at
h5-HT2B
receptors
for
agonist
actions
before
their
use

Alzheimer's
disease
(
AD
)
is
a
progressive
neurodegenerative
disorder
that
is
characterized
by
progressive
loss
of
memory
and
cognitive
impairment
.

Aggregation
of
amyloid-β
(
Aβ
)
peptides
is
the
crucial
factor
in
the
onset
of
AD
.

The
toxic
Aβ
peptides
Aβ40
and
Aβ42
are
produced
from
the
Aβ
precursor
protein
(
APP
)
,
a
transmembrane
protein
which
is
folded
and
modified
in
endoplasmic
reticulum
(
ER
)
.

ER
is
the
main
organelle
for
the
synthesis
and
processing
of
nearly
all
proteins
as
well
as
the
main
cellular
source
of
Ca2
+
.

Under
stress
conditions
,
three
main
ER
pathways
including
inositol-requiring
enzyme
1
,
protein
kinase
RNA-like
ER
kinase
,
and
activating
transcription
factor
6
become
activated
causing
the
accumulation
of
unfolded
or
misfolded
proteins
within
ER
lumen
.

These
pathways
manage
the
stress
by
regulating
the
expression
of
chaperones
and
enzymes
involved
in
protein
folding
.

Several
studies
have
reported
the
dysfunction
of
these
stress-sensing
pathways
in
pathological
conditions
,
including
neurodegenerative
diseases
.

Recent
studies
have
proposed
that
neuronal
death
in
AD
arises
from
dysfunction
of
the
ER
.

Here
,
we
will
review
recent
research
findings
on
the
interaction
between
ER
and
mitochondria
,
and
its
effect
on
apoptotic
pathways
.

We
further
provide
insights
into
studies
which
suggest
the
role
of
ER
in
animal
and
/
or
cellular
models
of
AD
.

Therapeutic
strategies
that
modulate
ER
could
represent
a
promising
approach
for
prevention
or
treatment
of
AD
.
Continuous

Using
genetic
and
pharmacological
approaches
,
we
demonstrate
that
both
RARgamma
/
RXRalpha
heterodimers
involved
in
repression
events
,
as
well
as
PPARbeta
(
delta
)
/
RXRalpha
heterodimers
involved
in
activation
events
,
are
cell-autonomously
required
in
suprabasal
keratinocytes
for
the
generation
of
lamellar
granules
(
LG
)
,
the
organelles
instrumental
to
the
formation
of
the
skin
permeability
barrier
.

In
activating
PPARbeta
(
delta
)
/
RXRalpha
heterodimers
,
RXRalpha
is
transcriptionally
active
as
its
AF-2
activation
function
is
required
and
can
be
inhibited
by
an
RXR-selective
antagonist
.

Within
repressing
RARgamma
/
RXRalpha
heterodimers
,
induction
of
the
transcriptional
activity
of
RXRalpha
is
subordinated
to
the
addition
of
an
agonistic
ligand
for
RARgamma
.

Thus
,
the
ligand
that
possibly
binds
and
activates
RXRalpha
heterodimerized
with
PPARbeta
(
delta
)
cannot
be
a
retinoic
acid
,
as
it
would
also
bind
RARgamma
and
relieve
the
RARgamma-mediated
repression
,
thereby
yielding
abnormal
LGs
.

Our
data
also
demonstrate
for
the
first
time
that
subordination
of
RXR
transcriptional
activity
to
that
of
its
RAR
partner
plays
a
crucial
role
in
vivo
,
because
it
allows
RXRs
to
act
concomitantly
,
within
the
same
cell
,
as
heterodimerization
partners
for
repression
,
as
well
as
for
activation
events
in
which
they
are
transcriptionally
active
.
We
have
found
that
certain
naphthalenesulfonamides
[
e
.

g
.

,
N-6
(
-aminohexyl
)
-5-chloro-1-naphthalenesulfonamide
(
W-7
)
]
and
phenothiazines
[
e
.

g
.

,
trifluoperazine
(
TFP
)
]
induce
a
loss
of
cell-surface
receptors
for
alpha
2-macroglobulin
,
and
epidermal
growth
factor
(
EGF
)
in
fibroblasts
.

The
loss
of
alpha
2-macroglobulin
receptors
is
independent
of
receptor
occupancy
and
is
rapidly
reversed
upon
removal
of
these
agents
from
the
culture
medium
.

The
extent
of
EGF
receptor
loss
is
less
than
for
alpha
2-macroglobulin
,
and
the
EGF
receptors
do
not
reappear
at
the
surface
when
W-7
is
removed
.

Receptor
loss
was
measured
as
a
change
in
the
capacity
for
binding
iodinated
ligands;
no
change
in
affinity
of
binding
was
observed
.

This
receptor
loss
could
reflect
inactivation
of
receptors
or
internalization
.

W-7
did
not
induce
a
loss
of
cell
surface
beta
2-microglobulin
,
a
membrane
protein
which
is
excluded
from
coated
pits
and
which
is
not
internalized
,
indicating
that
the
effect
of
W-7
was
specific
for
membrane
receptors
and
not
a
result
of
bulk
depletion
of
plasma
membrane
.

The
loss
of
alpha
2-macroglobulin
and
EGF
receptors
occurs
at
concentrations
which
do
not
cause
an
increase
in
the
pH
of
endocytic
vesicles
or
the
cytoplasm
,
indicating
that
these
agents
act
by
a
mechanism
distinct
from
the
effect
of
other
weak
bases
.

Since
both
TFP
and
W-7
are
potent
inhibitors
of
calmodulin
,
we
investigated
the
possibility
that
inhibition
of
calmodulin
was
responsible
for
the
loss
of
receptors
.

Three
lines
of
evidence
suggest
that
calmodulin
inhibition
is
not
responsible
for
the
inhibition
of
binding
and
endocytosis
:
1
)
Promethazine
,
a
phenothiazine
that
is
a
poor
inhibitor
of
calmodulin
,
is
nearly
as
effective
as
TFP
at
inhibiting
endocytosis;
calmidazolium
,
a
potent
inhibitor
of
several
calmodulin
functions
,
did
not
cause
a
loss
of
binding;
2
)
the
microinjection
of
calmodulin
into
cells
did
not
reverse
the
effects
of
W-7;
using
pressure
microinjection
,
we
introduced
up
to
a
100-fold
excess
of
calmodulin
over
native
levels
into
individual
gerbil
fibroma
cells;
using
rhodamine-labeled
alpha
2-macroglobulin
,
we
saw
that
the
W-7
induced
inhibition
of
receptor-mediated
endocytosis
was
the
same
in
injected
and
uninjected
cells;
3
)
we
injected
calcineurin
,
a
calmodulin-binding
protein
,
into
cells
(
1-3
pg
/
cell
)
and
observed
no
effect
on
the
receptor-mediated
endocytosis
of
rhodamine-labeled
alpha
2-macroglobulin
.

These
data
indicated
that
cell
surface
receptor
numbers
can
be
regulated
by
a
cellular
component
that
is
not
cytoplasmic
calmodulin
but
that
shares
some
drug
sensitivities
with
calmodulin
.
We
examined
the
relationship
between
PAH-DNA
adduct
levels
in

P-postlabeling
assay
,
and
the

.

We
further
explored
the
interaction
between
PAH-DNA
adducts
and
placental
PAHs
with
respect
to
NTD
risk
.

Placental
tissues
from
80
NTD-affected
pregnancies
and
50
uncomplicated
normal
pregnancies
were
included
in
this
case-control
study
.

Levels
of
PAH-DNA
adducts
were
lower
in
the
NTD
group
(

per

nucleotides
)
compared
to
controls
(
9
.
92
per
10
(
8
)
nucleotides
)
.

PAH-DNA
adduct
concentrations
below
the
median
was
associated
with
a
3-fold
increased
NTD
risk
.

Women
with
a
low
PAH-DNA
adduct
level
in
concert
with
a
high
placental
PAH
level
resulted
in
a
10-fold
elevated
risk
of
having
an
NTD-complicated
pregnancy
.

A
low
level
of
placental
PAH-DNA
adducts
was
associated
with
an
increased
risk
of
NTDs;
this
risk
increased
dramatically
when
a
low
adduct
level
was
coupled
with
a
high
placental
PAH
concentration

that
catalyzes
the
rate-limiting
step
in
glutathione
biosynthesis
.

The
expression
of
Gclc
,
the
catalytic
subunit
of
Gcl
,
was
upregulated
by
Cu
deficiency;
Gclm
,
the
modifier
subunit
,
was
not
affected
.

Hepatic
betaine-homocysteine
methyltransferase
(
Bhmt
)
,
which
catalyzes
one
of
the
two
ways
that
homocysteine
can
be
remethylated
to
methionine
,
was
downregulated
by
Cu
deficiency
.

Because
Cu
deficiency
results
in
upregulation
of
Gclc
and
an
increase
in
the
biosynthesis
of
glutathione
,
it
is
plausible
that
the
net
flux
of
homocysteine
through
the
transsulfuration
pathway
is
increased
.

Furthermore
,
if
Bhmt
is
downregulated
,
less
homocysteine
is
available
for
remethylation
(
methionine
recycling
)
and
more
is
then
available
to
irreversibly
enter
the
transsulfuration
pathway
where
it
is
lost
.

The
net
effect
of
increased
Gclc
and
decreased
Bhmt
would
be
a
decrease
in
homocysteine
as
a
result
of
Cu
deficiency
.
Continuous

)
has
been
an
important
strategy
of

development
for

.

Rotigotine
is
a

In

The
sim
fruit
(
Rhodomyrtus
tomentosa
)
has
long
been
used
in
folk
medicine
to
treat
diarrhoea
,
dysentery
,
and
to
boost
the
immune
system
.

The
purpose
of
this
work
was
to
determine
its
phenolic
profile
and
to
evaluate
the
changes
of
content
during
maturation
,
as
well
as
the
variations
induced
by
environmental
conditions
.

Using
HPLC-ESI-HR-MS
,
19
phenolic
compounds
(
PCs
)
were
tentatively
characterised
and
included
stilbenes
and
ellagitannins
as
major
components
,
followed
by
anthocyanins
,
flavonols
,
and
gallic
acid
.

PCs
were
then
further
quantified
by
HPLC-DAD
.

Piceatannol
,
a
promising
health-promoting
stilbene
component
,
was
the
major
PC
in
the
fruit
with
a
concentration
of
2
.
3mg
/
g
dry
weight
at
full
maturity
stage
.

This
concentration
is
1000-2000
times
higher
than
that
of
red
grapes
,
a
major
source
of
stilbene
in
the
human
diet
.

During
maturation
,
the
contents
in
piceatannol
and
other
stilbenes
,
ellagitannins
,
and
flavonols
decreased
while
the
anthocyanin
content
increased
.

Shade-grown
sim
fruits
showed
significantly
higher
piceatannol
levels
than
sun-exposed
fruits
.

Taken
together
,
these
findings
highlight
the
potential
of

Oxyntomodulin
(
Oxm
)
is
a
37-amino
acid
peptide
linked
to
alleviation
of
obesity-diabetes
through
a
dual
mode
of
action
mediated
at
both
glucagon
and
GLP-1
receptors
.

GIP
is
the
principle
physiological
regulator
of
postprandial
insulin
secretion
.

Therefore
,
the
primary
aim
was
to
design
a
novel
GIP-Oxm
peptide
incorporating
the
actions
of
GIP
,
GLP-1
and
glucagon
in
a
single
molecule
.

The
first
11
N-terminal
residues
of
Oxm
were
substituted
with
the
sequence
of
stable
dA
(
2
)
GIP
molecule
to
generate
a
novel
GIP-Oxm
peptide
(
dA
(
2
)
GIP-Oxm
)
.

dA
(
2
)
GIP-Oxm
was
resistant
to
DPP-IV
and
significantly
stimulated
in

insulin
release
.

dA
(

GIP-Oxm
stimulated
cAMP
production
in
GIP-R
,
glucagon-R
and
GLP-1-R
transfected
cells
by
up
to
95%
,
83%
and
77%
of
that
elicited
by
respective
native
ligands
.

Acute
administration
of
dA
(
2
)
GIP-Oxm
to
HFF
mice
resulted
in
reduced
plasma
glucose
(
45%
reduction
)
and
increased
insulin
concentrations
(
1
.
7-fold
increase
)
.

Furthermore
,
dA
(
2
)
GIP-Oxm
lowered
plasma
glucose
(
42%
reduction
)
and
increased
plasma
insulin
(
1
.
6-fold
increase
)
when
administered
to
HFF
mice
four
hours
prior
to
a
glucose
load
.

Once-daily
administration
of
dA
(
2
)
GIP-Oxm
for
15
days
in
HFF
mice
lowered
body
weight
(
13%
reduction
)
,
reduced
plasma
glucose
(
40%
reduction
)
and
increased
plasma
insulin
(
1
.
7-fold
increase
)
.

Furthermore
,
glycemic
responses
were
improved
(
38%
reduction
)
and
glucose-mediated
plasma
insulin
concentrations
enhanced
(
2-fold
increase
)
.

These
improvements
in
metabolic
control
were
independent
of
changes
in
food
intake
and
insulin
sensitivity
.

Such
multiple-acting
peptides
may
hold

A
series
of
studies
have
recently
demonstrated
that
the
release
of
interleukin
1β
induced
by
monosodium
urate
crystals
is
central
to
the
experimental
gouty
arthritis
.

Elaeagnus
pungens
has
been
traditionally
used
for
the
treatment
of
gouty
arthritis
in
China
for
more
than
thousands
years
.

However
,
there
is
still
little
known
about
the
active
ingredients
and
mechanisms
of
E
.

pungens
against
gouty
arthritis
.

Emodinol
,
as
a
major
triterpene
compound
in
E
.

pungens
,
has
been
seldom
reported
to
have
an
effect
on
gouty
arthritis
.

Therefore
,
the
potential
beneficial
effects
and
mechanisms
of
emodinol
on
gouty
arthritis
were
investigated
in
this
study
.

Results
showed
that
it
significantly
ameliorated
the
hyperalgesia
,
inflammation
,
and
levels
of
multiple
proinflammatory
cytokines
in
monosodium
urate
crystals-treated
mice
.

These
findings
elucidate
that
emodinol
exhibits
a
prominent
effect
on
improving
symptoms
of
acute
gouty
arthritis
induced
by
monosodium
urate
crystals
through
inhibiting
the
generation
of
proinflammatory

5-aminosalicylic
acid
(
5-ASA
)
preparations
(
eg
,
mesalazine
,
mesalamine
)
are
well-established
preparations
used
in
the
management
of
inflammatory
bowel
disease
.

These
drugs
are
most
useful
for
the
treatment
of
mild
to
moderate
flares
of
ulcerative
colitis
and
,
especially
,
for
maintenance
of
remission
.

Although
most
gastroenterologists
are
very
familiar
with
these
drugs
,
the
interest
in
these
drugs
has
undergone
a
resurgence
,
with
new
preparations
offering
convenience
and
high
dosage
,
while
preserving
their
customary
safety
.

New
dosage
regimens
are
likely
to
become
standard
practice
in
the
near
future
.

There
is
also
considerable
interest
in
chemoprevention
of
colorectal
cancer
in
the
context
of
inflammatory
bowel
disease
,
and
the
role
of
long-term
maintenance
therapy
with
5-ASAs
in
achieving
such
chemoprevention
.

A
mechanism
of
action
for
such
chemoprevention
has
been
provided
by
the
agonism
of
the
peroxisome
proliferator-activated
receptor-gamma
by
5-ASA
,
which
unifies
its
efficacy
as
an
anti-inflammatory
and
chemopreventive
agent
.

In
the
future
,
even
more
effective
agents
based
on
5-ASA
are
expected
,
based
on
more
powerful
agonism
of
peroxisome
proliferator-activated
receptor-gamma;
5-ASA
preparations
have
become
'trendy'
again
.
In
the
present

,
our
aim
was
to
determine
whether
intrafetal
glucose

of

The
expression
of

was
higher
in
the
ventromedial
nucleus
compared
to
the
arcuate
nucleus
of
the
hypothalamus
in
both
glucose
and
saline
infused
fetuses
(
F

and
there
was
a
positive
correlation
between

of

mRNA
in
the
arcuate
nucleus
(
r
=

.

Glucose
infusion
increased
mRNA
expression
for
POMC
,
but
not
for
the
anorectic
neuropeptide
CART
,
or
the
orexigenic
neuropeptides
NPY
and
AGRP
,
in
the
arcuate
nucleus
of
the
fetal
hypothalamus
.

These
findings
demonstrate
that
increased
circulating
glucose
and
insulin
regulate
gene
expression
of
the
neuropeptides
within
the
fetal
hypothalamus
that
are
part
of
the

Kinetic
parameters
of
the
effect
of
tacrine
as
a
cholinesterase
inhibitor
have
been
studied
in
two
different
sources
:
snake
venom
(
Bungarus
sindanus
)
acetylcholinesterase
(
AChE
)
and
human
serum
butyrylcholinesterase
(
BChE
)
.

Tacrine
inhibited
both
venom
acetylcholinesterase
(
AChE
)
as
well
as
human
serum
butyrylcholinesterase
(
BChE
)
in
a
concentration-dependent
manner
.

Kinetic
studies
indicated
that
the
nature
of
inhibition
was
mixed
for
both
enzymes
,
i
.

e
.

Km
values
increase
and
Vmax
decrease
with
the
increase
of
the
tacrine
concentration
.

The
calculated
IC50
for
snake
venom
and
for
human
serum
were
31
and
25
.
6
nM
,
respectively
.

Ki
was
observed
to
be
13
nM
for
venom
acetylcholinesterase
(
AChE
)
and
12
nM
for
serum
butyrylcholinesterase
(
BChE
)
.

KI
(
constant
of
AChE-ASCh-tacrine
complex
into
AChE-ASCh
complex
and
tacrine
)
was
estimated
to
be
20
nM
for
venom
and
10
nM
for
serum
butyrylcholinesterase
(
BChE
)
,
while
the
gammaKm
(
dissociation
constant
of
AChE-ASCh-tacrine
complex
into
AChE-tacrine
complex
and
ASCh
)
were
0
.
086
and
0
.
147
mM
for
snake
venom
AChE
and
serum
BChE
,
respectively
.

The
present
results
suggest
that
this
therapeutic
agent
used
for
the
treatment
of
Alzheimer's
disease
can
also
be
considered
an
inhibitor
of
snake
venom
and
human
serum
butyrylcholinesterase
.

Values
of
Ki
and
KI
show
that
tacrine
had
more
affinity
with
these
enzymes
as
compared
with
other
cholinesterases
from
the
literature
.
Methylation

AlkB

.
CD44
and
sulfation
have
both
been
implicated
in
leukocyte
adhesion
.

In
monocytes
,
the
inflammatory
cytokine
tumor
necrosis
factor
alpha
(
TNF-alpha
)
stimulates
CD44
sulfation
,
and
this
correlates
with
the
induction
of
CD44-mediated
adhesion
events
.

However
,
little
is
known
about
the
sulfation
of
CD44
or
its
induction
by
inflammatory
cytokines
.

We
determined
that
TNF-alpha
induces
the
carbohydrate
sulfation
of
CD44
.

CD44
was
established
as
a
major
sulfated
cell
surface
protein
on
myeloid
cells
.

In
the
SR91
myeloid
cell
line
,
the
majority
of
CD44
sulfation
was
attributed
to
the
glycosaminoglycan
chondroitin
sulfate
.

However
,
TNF-alpha
stimulation
increased
CD44
sulfation
two-
to
threefold
,
largely
attributed
to
the
increased
sulfation
of
N-
and
O-linked
glycans
on
CD44
.

Therefore
,
TNF-alpha
induced
a
decrease
in
the
percentage
of
CD44
sulfation
due
to
chondroitin
sulfate
and
an
increase
due
to
N-
and
O-linked
sulfation
.

Furthermore
,
TNF-alpha
induced
the
expression
of
6-sulfo
N-acetyl
lactosamine
(
LacNAc
)
/
Lewis
x
on
these
cells
,
which
was
detected
by
a
monoclonal
antibody
after
neuraminidase
treatment
.

This
6-sulfo
LacNAc
/
Lewis
x
epitope
was
induced
on
N-linked
and
(
to
a
lesser
extent
)
on
O-linked
glycans
present
on
CD44
.

This
demonstrates
that
CD44
is
modified
by
sulfated
carbohydrates
in
myeloid
cells
and
that
TNF-alpha
modifies
both
the
type
and
amount
of
carbohydrate
sulfation
occurring
on
CD44
.

In
addition
,
it
demonstrates
that
TNF-alpha
can
induce
the
expression
of
6-sulfo
N-acetyl
glucosamine
on
both
N-
and
O-linked
glycans
of
CD44
in
myeloid
cells
.
Over-expression
of
cleaved
cyclin
E
in
breast
tumors
is
closely
associated
with
tumor
progression
and
resistance
to
antiestrogens
.

17β-Estradiol
(
E2
)
has
been
recently
shown
to
induce
cyclin
E
processing
in
breast
cancer
cells
.

Tamoxifen
has
been
used
in
patients
with
estrogen-sensitive
breast
cancer
,
yet
resistance
to
antiestrogens
and
recurrence
will
appear
in
some
of
the
patients
after
its
continued
use
.

We
therefore
addressed
possible
effects
of
tamoxifen
on
the
generation
of
cleaved
cyclin
E
and
its
signal
mechanism
(
s
)
in
estrogen-responsive
MCF-7
breast
cancer
cells
that
express
both
G
protein-coupled
protein
(
GPR
)
30
and
estrogen
receptor
α
(
ERα
)
.

4-Hydroxytamoxifen
(
OHT
,
tamoxifen's
active
form
)
failed
to
prevent
E2-induced
proteolysis
of
cyclin
E
and
migration
,
but
rather
triggered
cyclin
E
cleavage
coincident
with
augmented
migration
.

OHT-induced
cyclin
E
truncation
also
occurred
in
SK-BR-3
cells
that
express
GPR30
and
lack
ERα
,
but
not
in
MDA-MB-231
cells
that
express
neither
GPR30
nor
ERα
.

G1
,
a
specific
GPR
30
agonist
,
caused
dramatic
proteolysis
of
cyclin
E
and
enhanced
migration
.

Furthermore
,
OHT-stimulated
cleavage
of
cyclin
E
and
migration
were
tremendously
attenuated
by
G15
,
a
GPR30
antagonist
,
or
siRNA
against
GPR30
.

In
addition
,
inhibitors
for
EGFR
or
ERK1
/
2
remarkably
suppressed
OHT-induced
truncation

Persistent
hyperglycemia
is
associated
with

oxidative
stress
which
contributes
to
the
development
and
progression
of
diabetes-associated
complications
.

The
sensitivity
of
pancreatic
β-cells
to
oxidative
stress
has
been
attributed
to
their
low
content
of
antioxidants
compared
with
other
tissues
.

Bioactive
compounds
with
potent
antidiabetic
properties
have
been
shown
to
ameliorate
hyperglycemia

oxidative
stress
.

,

The
present
study
was
aimed
to
evaluate
the
antioxidant
potential
of
fisetin
in
both
in

and
in

.

Diabetes
was
induced
by
single

of

(
50

.

Fisetin
was
administered
orally
for
30
days
.

At
the
end
of
the
study
,
all
animals
were
killed
.

Blood
samples
were
collected
for
the
biochemical
estimations
.

The
antioxidant

was
evaluated
.

Histological

were
performed
on

Fisetin

showed

The
treatment
also
improved
the
antioxidant

as
well
as

the
antioxidant

In

Arsenic
(
As
(
III
)
)
exposure
may
increase
metabolic
syndrome
and
cardiovascular
disease
risk
by
impairing
adipose
tissue
differentiation
,
function
,
and
insulin
sensitivity
through
pathogenic
mechanisms
that
remain
unclear
.

We
hypothesized
that
As
(
III
)
signals
through
the
Pertussis
toxin
(
Ptx
)
sensitive
,
Gi
protein-coupled
receptor
(
GPCR
)
to
impair
adipogenesis
,
as
previously
demonstrated
for
its
stimulation
of
vascular
oxidant
generation
,
angiogenesis
,
and
remodeling
.

Because
both
As
(
III
)
and
GPCR
ligands
inhibit
progenitor
cell
differentiation
into
adipocytes
,
we
investigated
the
hypothesis
in
a
model
of
low-passage
human
mesenchymal
stem
cells
(
hMSC
)
.

As
(
III
)
(
0
.
1-1
.
0
µM
)
suppressed
dexamethasone
/
insulin-induced
hMSC
adipogenesis
,
as
indicated
by
decreased
transcriptional
promoters
of
differentiation
,
decreased
fat
droplet
formation
,
and
decreased
expression
of
differentiated
adipocyte
markers
,
such
as
adiponectin
and
perilipin
.

Preincubating
hMSC
with
Ptx
prevented
90%
of
the
suppressive
effect
of
As
(
III
)
.

Selective
competitive
antagonists
of
Gi-coupled
endothelin-1
type
A
and
B
receptors
were
~60%
effective
in
blocking
As
(
III
)
inhibition
and
combination
of
antagonists
to
both
receptors
were
85%
effective
.

In
contrast
,
antagonists
to
the
sphingosine-1-phosphate
type
1
receptor
(
previously
shown
to
mediate
As
(
III
)
vascular
effects
)
or
the
angiotensin
II
type
1
receptor
were
ineffective
in
blocking
As
(
III
)
effects
.

These
studies
suggest
a
majority
of
arsenic-inhibited
adipocyte
differentiation
,
and
metabolism
requires
endothelin-1
GPCRs
and
that
As
(
III
)
effects
on
GPCR
signaling
are
tissue
and
context
specific
.

This
may
represent
a
significant
mechanism
for
the
contribution
of
arsenic
exposure
to
increased
metabolic
and
cardiovascular
diseases
.
Interleukin
(
IL
)
-6
is
critical
for
the
febrile
response
to
peripheral
immune
challenge
.

However
,
the
mechanism
by
which
IL-6
enables
fever
is
still
unknown
.

To
characterise
the
IL-6-dependent
fever
generating
pathway
,
we
used
microarray
analysis
to
identify
differentially
expressed
genes
in
the
brain
of
lipopolysaccharide
(
LPS
)
-treated
IL-6
wild-type
and
knockout
mice
.

Mice
lacking
IL-6
displayed
a
two-fold
lower
expression
of
the
lipocalin-2
gene
(
lcn2
)
,
and
this
difference
was
confirmed
by
real-time
reverse
transcriptase-polymerase
chain
reaction
.

Conversely
,
the
induction
of
lipocalin-2
protein
was
observed
in
brain
vascular
cells
following
i
.

p
.

administration
of
recombinant
IL-6
,
suggesting
a
direct
relationship
between
IL-6
and
lipocalin-2
.

Immunohistochemical
analysis
also
revealed
that
LPS-induced
lipocalin-2
is
expressed
by
brain
endothelial
cells
and
is
partly
co-localised
with
cyclooxygenase-2
(
Cox-2
)
,
the
rate-limiting
enzyme
for
the
production
of
inflammatory
induced
prostaglandin
E
(
2
)
(
PGE
(
2
)
)
,
which
is
the
key
mediator
of
fever
.

The
direct
role
of
lipocalin-2
in
fever
was
examined
in
LPS-challenged
lipocalin-2
knockout
mice
.

In
both
male
and
female
mice
,
normal
fever
responses
were
observed
at
near-thermoneutral
conditions
(
29-30
°C
)
but
when
recorded
at
normal
room
temperature
(
19-20
°C
)
,
the
body
temperature
of
lipocalin-2
knockout
female
mice
displayed
an
attenuated
fever
response
compared
to
their
wild-type
littermates
.

This
difference
was
reflected
in
significantly
attenuated
mRNA
expression
of
Cox-2
in
the
brain
of
lipocalin-2
knockout
female
mice
,
but
not
of
male
mice
,
following
challenge
with
peripheral
LPS
.

Our
findings
suggest
that
IL-6
influences
the
expression
of
lipocalin-2
,
which
in
turn
may
be
involved
in
the
control
of
the
formation
of
Cox-2
,
and
hence
central
PGE
(
2
)
-production
.

We
have
thus
identified
lipocalin-2
as
a
new
factor
in
the
pathway
of
inflammatory
IL-6
signalling
.

However
,
the
effect
of
lipocalin-2
on
fever
is
small
,
being
sex-dependent
and
ambient
temperature-specific
,
and
thus
lipocalin-2
cannot
be
considered
as
a
major
mediator
of
the
IL-6-dependent
fever
generating
pathway
.
Glutathione
peroxidases
(
GPXs
)
are
a
group
of
enzymes
that
regulate
the
levels
of
reactive
oxygen
species
in
cells
and
tissues
,
and
protect
them
against
oxidative
damage
.

Contrary
to
most
of
their
counterparts
in
animal
cells
,
the
higher
plant
GPX
homologues
identified
so
far
possess
cysteine
instead
of
selenocysteine
in
their
active
site
.

Interestingly
,
the
plant
GPXs
are
not
dependent
on
glutathione
but
rather
on
thioredoxin
as
their
in
vitro
electron
donor
.

We
have
determined
the
crystal
structures
of
the
reduced
and
oxidized
form
of
Populus
trichocarpaxdeltoides
GPX5
(
PtGPX5
)
,
using
a
selenomethionine
derivative
.

PtGPX5
exhibits
an
overall
structure
similar
to
that
of
the
known
animal
GPXs
.

PtGPX5
crystallized
in
the
assumed
physiological
dimeric
form
,
displaying
a
pseudo
ten-stranded
beta
sheet
core
.

Comparison
of
both
redox
structures
indicates
that
a
drastic
conformational
change
is
necessary
to
bring
the
two
distant
cysteine
residues
together
to
form
an
intramolecular
disulfide
bond
.

In
addition
,
a
computer
model
of
a
complex
of
PtGPX5
and
its
in
vitro
recycling
partner
thioredoxin
h1
is
proposed
on
the
basis
of
the
crystal
packing
of
the
oxidized
form
enzyme
.

A
possible
role
of
PtGPX5
as
a
heavy-metal
sink
is
also
discussed

Of
all
cancers
,
prostate
cancer
is
the
most
sensitive
to
hormones
:
it
is
thus
very
important
to
take
advantage
of
this
unique
property
and
to
always
use
optimal
androgen
blockade
when
hormone
therapy
is
the
appropriate
treatment
.

A
fundamental
observation
is
that
the
serum
testosterone
concentration
only
reflects
the
amount
of
testosterone
of
testicular
origin
which
is
released
in
the
blood
from
which
it
reaches
all
tissues
.

Recent
data
show
,
however
,
that
an
approximately
equal
amount
of
testosterone
is
made
from
dehydroepiandrosterone
(
DHEA
)
directly
in
the
peripheral
tissues
,
including
the
prostate
,
and
does
not
appear
in
the
blood
.

Consequently
,
after
castration
,
the
95-97%
fall
in
serum
testosterone
does
not
reflect
the
40-50%
testosterone
(
testo
)
and
dihydrotestosterone
(
DHT
)
made
locally
in
the
prostate
from
DHEA
of
adrenal
origin
.

In
fact
,
while
elimination
of
testicular
androgens
by
castration
alone
has
never
been
shown
to
prolong
life
in
metastatic
prostate
cancer
,
combination
of
castration
(
surgical
or
medical
with
a
gonadotropin-releasing
hormone
(
GnRH
)
agonist
)
with
a
pure
anti-androgen
has
been
the
first
treatment
shown
to
prolong
life
.

Most
importantly
,
when
applied
at
the
localized
stage
,
the
same
combined
androgen
blockade
(
CAB
)
can
provide
long-term
control
or
cure
of
the
disease
in
more
than
90%
of
cases
.

Obviously
,
since
prostate
cancer
usually
grows
and
metastasizes
without
signs
or
symptoms
,
screening
with
prostate-specific
antigen
(
PSA
)
is
absolutely
needed
to
diagnose
prostate
cancer
at
an
'early'
stage
before
metastasis
occurs
and
the
cancer
becomes
non-curable
.

While
the
role
of
androgens
was
believed
to
have
become
non-significant
in
cancer
progressing
under
any
form
of
androgen
blockade
,
recent
data
have
shown
increased
expression
of
the
androgen
receptor
(
AR
)
in
treatment-resistant
disease
with
a
benefit
of
further
androgen
blockade
.

Since
the
available
anti-androgens
have
low
affinity
for
AR
and
cannot
block
androgen
action
completely
,
especially
in
the
presence
of
increased
AR
levels
,
it
becomes
important
to
discover
more
potent
and
purely
antagonistic
blockers
of
AR
.

The
data
obtained
with
compounds
under
development
are
promising
.

While
waiting
for
this
(

anti-androgen
(

,
combined
treatment
with
castration
and

or

is
the
only
available
and
the
best
scientifically
based
means
of
treating
prostate
cancer
by
hormone
therapy
at
any
stage
of
the
disease
with
the
optimal
chance
of
success
and

,
5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl
)
-2

assay
.

A
1%

concentration
of
bamboo
salt
baked
nine
times
(
9×
)
inhibited
the
growth
of
HCT-116
cells
by
53%
,
which
was
higher
than
salt
baked
three
times
(
3×
)
or

(

than

(
Korean

)
and
purified

(
22%

respectively
)
.

To

the

underlying
the
anticancer
effect
of
the
salt
samples
in

cells
,
expression
of
genes
associated

was
measured

significantly
induced

)
by
upregulating

.

The
expression
of

)
was
significantly

The

than
the
other

as
demonstrated
by
decreased

The
implementation
of
a
reactive
functional
group
onto
a
material
surface
is
of
great
importance
.

Reactive
functional
groups
(
e
.

g
.

,
an
amino
group
and
a
hydroxyl
group
)
are
usually
hydrophilic
,
which
makes
it
difficult
to
display
them
on
a
dry
polymer
surface
.

We
here
propose
a
novel
method
for
displaying
amino
groups
on
the
surfaces
of
polymeric
substrates
through
dip-coating
of
a
methacrylate-based
copolymer
.

We
synthesized
copolymers
composed
of
methyl
methacrylate
and
2-aminoethyl
methacrylate
with
different
protecting
groups
or
ion-complexes
on
their
amino
groups
,
then
dip-coated
the
copolymers
onto
a
poly
(
methyl
methacrylate
)
(
PMMA
)
substrate
.

Evaluation
using
a
cleavable
fluorescent
compound
,
which
was
synthesized
in
the
present
study
to
quantify
a
small
amount
(
pmol
/
cm
(
2
)
)
of
amino
groups
on
a
solid
surface
,
revealed
that
the
protection
of
amino
groups
affected
their
surface
segregation
in
the
copolymer
coating
.

p-Toluenesulfonate
ion-complex
and
tert-butoxycarbonyl
(
Boc
)
protection
of
amino
groups
were
found
to
effectively
display
amino
groups
on
the
surface
(
more
than
70
pmol
/
cm
(
2
)
)
.

The
density
of
amino
groups
displayed
on
a
surface
can
be
easily
controlled
by
mixing
the
copolymer
and
PMMA
before
dip-coating
.

Dip-coating
of
the
copolymer
with
Boc
protection
on
various
polymeric
substrates
also
successfully
displayed
amino
groups
on
their
surfaces
.

Finally
,
we
demonstrated
that
the
amino
groups
displayed
can
be
utilized
for
the
immobilization
of
a
DNA
oligonucleotide
on
a

A

For
more

years
,
tamoxifen
has
been
the
gold
standard
for
the
adjuvant
treatment
of
postmenopausal
women
with
hormone-responsive
early
breast
cancer
.

However
,
recent
randomized
trials
have
shown
efficacy
and
tolerability
benefits
with
the
third-generation
aromatase
inhibitor
anastrozole
,
resulting
in
an
increased
use
of
this
agent
in
the
adjuvant
setting
.

Data
on
anastrozole's
long-term
efficacy
and
tolerability
are
therefore
of
interest
in
clinical
practice
and
will
be
reviewed
here
,
especially
in
the
light
of
the

analysis
of

OBJECTIVE
:
To
establish
if
serum
levels
of
interleukin-10
(
IL-10
)
in
subjects
exposed
to
benzene
are
connected
with
age
,
working
years
,
and
employment
age
.

METHODS
:
We
evaluated
serum
levels
of
IL-10
in
51
employees
working
in
oil
refinery
(
group
A
)
and
in
16
office
workers
who
resided
in
the
same
area
(
group
B
)
.

RESULTS
:
There
was
no
statistically
significant
difference
between
serum
concentrations
of
IL-10
in
groups
A
and
B
.

There
was
a
statistically
significant
dependent
relationship
in
group
A
between
age
,
working
years
,
and
serum
concentration
of
IL-10
.

There
was
a
statistically
significant
and
positive
dependent
relationship
in
group
A
between
serum
concentration
of
IL-10
and
employment
age
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
The
role
played
by
IL-10
in
benzene
immune
suppression
may
be
relevant
and
attention
should
be
directed
toward
assessment
of
age

Voltage-dependent
calcium

(
VDCCs
)
are
multimeric

with
several
accessory
subunits
,
including
alpha
(

)
delta
,
beta
,
and
,
in
some
cases
,
gamma
subunits
.

A
family
of
VDCCs
known
as
the
L-type

are
formed
specifically
from
alpha
(

)
(
skeletal

)
,
alpha
(

(
in

)
,

,
and

)
,
and

(

.

Neuroendocrine
L-type
currents
have
a
significant
role
in
the
control
of
neurosecretion
and
can
be
inhibited
by
GTP-binding
(

)
proteins
.

However
,
the
subunit
composition
of
the
VDCCs
underlying
these
G-protein-regulated
neuroendocrine
L-type
currents
is
unknown
.

To
investigate
the
biophysical
and
pharmacological
properties
and
role
of
G-protein
modulation
of
alpha
(
1D
)
calcium
channels
,
we
have
examined
calcium
channel
currents
formed
by
the
human
neuronal
L-type
alpha
(
1D
)
subunit
,
co-expressed
with
alpha
(
2
)
delta-1
and
beta
(

)
,
stably
expressed
in
a
human
embryonic
kidney
(
HEK
)
293
cell
line
,
using
whole
cell
and
perforated
patch-clamp
techniques
.

The
alpha
(
1D
)
-expressing
cell
line
exhibited
L-type
currents
with
typical
characteristics
.

The
currents
were
high-voltage
activated
(
peak
at
+
20
mV
in
20
mM
Ba2
+
)
and
showed
little
inactivation
in
external
Ba2
+
,
while
displaying
rapid
inactivation
kinetics
in
external
Ca2
+
.

The
L-type
currents
were
inhibited
by
the
1
,
4
dihydropyridine
(
DHP
)
antagonists
nifedipine
and
nicardipine
and
were
enhanced
by
the
DHP
agonist
BayK
S-
(
-
)
8644
.

However
,
alpha
(
1D
)
L-type
currents
were
not
modulated
by
activation
of
a
number
of
G-protein
pathways
.

Activation
of
endogenous
somatostatin
receptor
subtype
2
(

)
by
somatostatin-14
or
activation
of
transiently
transfected
rat
D2
dopamine
receptors
(
rD2
(
long

)
by
quinpirole
had
no
effect
.

Direct
activation
of
G-proteins
by
the
nonhydrolyzable
GTP
analogue
,
guanosine
5'-0-
(
3-thiotriphospate
)
also
had
no
effect
on
the
alpha
(
1D
)
currents
.

In
contrast
,
in
the
same
system
,
N-type
currents
,
formed
from
transiently
transfected
alpha
(
1B
)
/
alpha
(
2
)
delta-1
/
beta
(
3
)
,
showed
strong
G-protein-mediated
inhibition
.

Furthermore
,
the
I-II
loop
from
the
alpha
(
1D
)
clone
,
expressed
as
a
glutathione-S-transferase
(
GST
)
fusion
protein
,
did
not
bind
Gbetagamma
,
unlike
the
alpha
(
1B
)
I-II
loop
fusion
protein
.

These
data
show
that
the
biophysical
and
pharmacological
properties
of
recombinant
human
alpha
(
1D
)
L-type
currents
are
similar
to
alpha
(
1C

currents
,
and
these
currents
are
also
resistant
to
modulation
by

Disorders
of
emotion
regulation
such
as
anxiety
disorders
and
depression
are
common
and
yet
debilitating
.

Accumulating
evidence
suggests
involvement
of
serotonin
(
5-HT
)
in
the
regulation
of
emotion
.

Mice
with
targeted
deletion
of
genes
encoding
mediators
of
the
serotonergic
transmission
have
proven
to
be
a
powerful
tool
for
understanding
contributions
of
such
mediators
of
emotion
regulation
.

Over
the
last
decade
,
research
on
mice
with
a
targeted
inactivation
of
the
5-HT
transporter
(
5-Htt
,
Sert
,
Slc6a4
)
has
considerably
advanced
our
knowledge
about
functions
that
the
5-HTT
plays
in
the
context
of
emotion
related
to
depression
.

Moreover
,
the
recent
advent
of
knockout
(
KO
)
mice
for
tryptophan
hydroxylase
2
(
Tph2
KO
)
,
which
lacks
the
rate-limiting
enzyme
for
5-HT
synthesis
in
the
brain
,
has
further
provided
insight
to
the
brain
serotonergic
system
and
its
role
in
emotion
dysregulation
.

Here
,
we
first
highlight
basic
characteristics
of
the
serotonergic
system
including
the
biosynthesis
of
5-HT
as
well
as
the
anatomy
and
firing
activity
of
serotonergic
neurons
.

Furthermore
,
characteristics
of
5-Htt
and
Tph2
KO
mice
are
covered
together
with
association
studies
on
human
variants
of
5-HTT
and
TPH2
in
emotional
regulation
.

Among
various
targets
of
serotonergic
projections
,
which
originate
from
the
raphe
nuclei
in
the
brain
stem
,
particular
focus
is
placed
on
the
hippocampus
due
to
its
unique
dual
role
in
memory
and
emotion
.

Finally
,
effects
of
therapeutic
drugs
and
psychoactive
drugs
on
KO
mouse
models
as
well
as
on

will
be
discussed

Loss

increases

We
have
previously

factor
(

)
downregulates

and
induces

(

transcriptional
repressor
Snail
.

However
,
the
molecular
mechanisms
underlying
the
EGF-induced
downregulation
of
E-cadherin
are
not
fully
understood
.

In
the
current
study
,
we
demonstrated
that
treatment
of
two
ovarian
cancer
cell
lines
,
SKOV3
and
OVCAR5
,
with
EGF
induced
the
expression
of
the
transcription
factor
Egr-1
,
and
this
induction
was
abolished
by
small
interfering
RNA
(
siRNA
)
-mediated
depletion
of
the
EGF
receptor
.

EGF-induced
Egr-1
expression
required
the
activation
of
the
ERK1
/
2
and
PI3K
/
Akt
signaling
pathways
and
was
unrelated
to
EGF-induced
H
(
2
)
O
(
2
)
production
and
activation
of
the
p38
MAPK
pathway
.

Moreover
,
depletion
of
Egr-1
with
siRNA
abolished
the
EGF-induced
downregulation
of
E-cadherin
and
increased
cell
invasion
.

Interestingly
,
siRNA
depletion
of
Egr-1
attenuated
the
EGF-induced
expression
of
Slug
,
but
not
that
of
Snail
.

Moreover
,
chromatin
immunoprecipitation
(
ChIP
)
analysis
showed
that
Slug
is
a
target
gene
of
Egr-1
.

These
results
provide
evidence
that
Egr-1
is
a
mediator
that
is
involved
in
the
EGF-induced
downregulation
of
E-cadherin
and
increased
cell
invasion
.

Our
results
also
demonstrate
that
EGF
activates
two
independent
signaling
pathways
,
which
are
the
H
(
2
)
O
(
2
)
/
p38
MAPK-mediated
upregulation
of
Snail
expression
and
the
Egr-1-mediated
upregulation
of
Slug
expression
.

These
two
signaling
pathways
contribute
to
the
EGF-induced
downregulation
of
E-cadherin
,
which
subsequently
increases
the
invasive
capability
of
ovarian
cancer
cells
.

In

The
polyamines
putrescine
,
spermidine
,
and
spermine
are
essential
for
mammalian
cell
growth
,
-differentiation
,
and
cell
death
and
have
important
physiological
roles
in
all
tissues
.

Many
of
the
properties
of
polyamines
that
can
be
demonstrated
in

are
common
to
all
three
molecules
with
differences
only
in
potency
.

Loss
of
any
of
the
enzymes
needed
to
make
either
putrescine
or
spermidine
(
which
also
-prevent
the
production
of
spermine
)
is
lethal
,
but
male
mice
lacking
spermine
synthase
(
SpmS
)
due
to
a
deletion
of
part
of
the
X
chromosome
are
viable
on
the
B6C3H
background
.

These
mice
are
termed
Gyro
(
Gy
)
due
to
their
circling
behavior
.

They
have
a
variety
of
abnormalities
including
deafness
,
neurological
problems
,
small
size
,
and
a
tendency
to
early
death
.

They
can
therefore
be
used
to
evaluate
the
physiological
function
(
s
)
uniquely
provided
by
spermine
.

They
also
provide
a
potential
animal
model
for
Snyder-Robinson
syndrome
(
SRS
)
,
a
rare
human
inherited
disease
due
to
a
loss
of
SpmS
activity
.

An
essential
control
in
experiments
using
Gy
mice
is
to
demonstrate
that
the
abnormal
phenotypes
exhibited
by
these
mice
are
abolished
by
providing
replacement
spermine
and
this
can
be
accomplished
by
breeding
with
CAG-SMS
mice
that
express
SpmS
from
a
ubiquitous
promoter
.

Techniques
for
identifying
,
characterizing
,
and
using
these
mouse
strains
and
limitations
of
this
approach
are
described

Human

channel

and
its
structural
analysis
for
drug
design
.
The
major
subunit
of
the
cardiac
delayed
rectifier
current
I
(
Kr
)
is
encoded
by
the
human
ether
a-go-go
related
gene
(
HERG
)
.

HERG
/
I
(
Kr
)
channels
are
blocked
selectively
by
class
III
antiarrhythmic
methanesulfonanilide
drugs
such
as
dofetilide
.

The
binding
site
for
methanesulfonanilides
is
believed
to
be
similar
for
nonantiarrhythmic
drugs
such
as
antihistamines
,
antibiotics
,
and
antipsychotics
.

To
gain
further
insight
into
the
binding
site
,
we
examined
the
minimal
structural
changes
necessary
to
transform
low-affinity
binding
of
dofetilide
by
the
related
bovine
ether
a-go-go
channel
bEAG
to
high-affinity
binding
of
HERG
.

Previously
,
it
was
shown
that
high-affinity
binding
in
HERG
required
intact
C-type
inactivation;
the
bovine
ether
a-go-go
K
(
+
)
channel
(
bEAG
)
,
unlike
HERG
,
is
noninactivating
.

Therefore
,
we
introduced
C-type
inactivation
into
noninactivating
bEAG
using
site-directed
mutagenesis
.

Two
point
mutations
in
the
pore
region
,
T432S
and
A443S
,
were
sufficient
to
produce
C-type
inactivation
.

Low
concentrations
of
dofetilide
produced
block
of
bEAG
T432S
/
A443S;
unlike
HERG
,
block
was
almost
irreversible
.

Substitution
of
an
additional
amino
acid
in
transmembrane
domain
S6
made
the
block
reversible
.

Dofetilide
blocked
the
triply
mutated
bEAG
T432S
/
A443S
/
A453S
with
an
IC
(
50
)
value
of
1
.
1
microM
.

The
blocking
potency
was
30-fold
greater
than
bEAG
WT
and
about
one
third
that
of
HERG
WT
.

We
conclude
that
high
affinity
methanesulfonanilide
binding
to
HERG
channels
is
strongly
dependent
on
C-type
inactivation
.

PURPOSE
:
To
evaluate
the
effects
of
INS37217
on
the
recovery
of
retinal
function
after
experimental
retinal
detachment
induced
by
subretinal
injection
.

METHODS
:
Subretinal
injections
of
1
micro
L
of
fluorescent
microbeads
,
saline
,
or
INS37217
(
1-200
micro

)
were
made
by
the
transvitreal
method
in
normal

)
mice
and
in
mice
heterozygous
for
the
retinal
degeneration
slow
(
rds
)
gene
.

Control
,
mock-injected
animals
underwent
corneal
puncture
without
injection
.

Histologic
and
ERG
evaluations
were
made
at
0
to
1
and
8
hours
,
and
1
,
3
,
7
,
10
,
14
,
and
60
days
post
injection
(
PI
)
.

DNA
fragmentation
was
evaluated
by
terminal
deoxynucleotidyl
transferase-mediated
uridine

nick
end

(
TUNEL
)
.

RESULTS
:
A
single
subretinal
injection
of
saline
solution
containing
fluorescent
beads
caused
a
histologically
evident
retinal
detachment
and
distributed
the
microbeads
to
almost
all
the
subretinal
space
.

Spontaneous
reattachment
occurred
within
24
hours
after
injection
and
was
accompanied
by
evident
retinal
folding
that
appeared
largely
resolved
by
6
days
later
.

Relative
to
controls
,
injection
of
saline
resulted
in
approximately
40%
recovery
of
dark-adapted
a-wave
amplitude
at
24
hours
PI
and
gradually
improved
to
approximately
90%
of
controls
at
2
months
PI
.

Subretinal
injection
of
saline
containing
INS37217
(
10
micro
M
)
significantly
increased

ERG
of
normal
and
rds
(
+
/
-
)
mice
at
1
and
10
days
PI
,
when
compared
with
injection
of
saline
alone
.

Additionally
,
INS37217
reduced
the
number
of
TUNEL-positive
photoreceptors
and
the
enhanced
rate
of
reattachment
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
Enhancement
of
ERG
recovery
by
INS37217
is
likely
due
to
reduced
retinal
folding
and
cell
death
associated
with
detachment
.

These
results
support
the
use
of
INS37217
to
help
restore
function
after
therapies
that
involve
subretinal
administration
of
drugs
in
animal
models

As
the
pandemic
of
type
2
diabetes
spreads
globally
,
clinicians
face
many
challenges
in
treating
an
increasingly
diverse
patient
population
varying
in
age
,
comorbidities
,
and
socioeconomic
status
.

Current
therapies
for
type
2
diabetes
are
often
unable
to
alter
the
natural
course
of
the
disease
and
provide
durable
glycemic
control
,
and
side
effects
in
the
context
of
individual
patient
characteristics
often
limit
treatment
choices
.

This
often
results
in
the
progression
to
insulin
use
and
complex
regimens
that
are
difficult
to
maintain
.

Therefore
,
a
number
of
agents
are
being
developed
to
better
address
the
pathogenesis
of
type
2
diabetes
and
to
overcome
limitations
of
current
therapies
.

The
hope
is
to
provide
more
options
for
glucose
lowering
and
complication
reduction
with
less
risk
for
hypoglycemia
and
other
adverse
effects
.

These
agents
include
newer
incretin-based
therapies
and
PPAR
agonists
,
as
well
as
new
therapeutic
classes
such
as
sodium-coupled
glucose
cotransporter
2
inhibitors
,
free
fatty
acid
receptor
agonists
,
11-β-hydroxysteroid
dehydrogenase
type
1
inhibitors
,
glucokinase
activators
,
and
several
others
that
may
enter
clinical
use
over
the
next
decade
.

Herein
we
review
these
agents
that
are
advancing
through
clinical
trials
and
describe
the
rationale
behind
their
use
,
mechanisms
of
action
,
and
potential
for
glucose
lowering
,
as
well
as
what
is
known
of
their
limitations
.

It
has
recently
been
shown
that
high-fat
diets
induce
the
expression
of
peroxisome
proliferator-activated
receptor
(
PPAR
)
with
a
concomitant
decrease
in
expression
of
retinoic
acid
(
RAR
)
and
triiodothyronine
(
TR
)
receptors
in
rat
liver
.

The
authors
have
suggested
that
PPAR
activation
may
be
responsible
for
these
modifications
in
nuclear
receptor
expression
.

With
the
aim
of
gaining
further
insight
into
a
possible
relationship
between
the
patterns
of
expression
of
these
receptors
,
we
have
examined
,
using
a
pharmacological
model
,
the
effect
of
a
strong
and
specific
PPAR
activation
induced
by
bezafibrate
,
a
peroxisome
proliferator
agent
.

Activation
of
PPAR
was
evaluated
by
quantifying
PPAR
alpha
mRNA
and
acyl-CoA
oxidase
mRNA
.

The
expression
of
RAR
and
TR
was
determined
by
assaying
the
binding
properties
of
these
nuclear
receptors
and
by
quantifying
the
mRNA
level
of
RAR
beta
and
TR
alpha1
,
beta1
isoforms
.

After
a
10
day
treatment
of
young
rats
,
induction
of
PPAR
(
PPAR
alpha
mRNA
was
increased
by
40%
[
P<
0
.
05
and
acyl-CoA
oxidase
mRNA
by
411%
[
P<0
.
001
]
)
and
a
concomitant
decrease
of
RAR
and
TR
expression
(
Maximal
Binding
Capacity
was
decreased
by
21
and
26%
,
respectively
[
P<0
.
05
]
)
in
the
liver
was
observed
.

RXR
alpha
mRNA
expression
was
unchanged
by
treatment
.

Cross-talk
between
RAR
,
TR
and
PPAR
signalling
pathways
may
be
implicated
in
the
new
patterns
of
nuclear
receptor
expression
observed
.

The
decreased
expression
of
RAR
and
TR
reported
here
could
provide
a
novel
element
for
the
understanding
of
the
link
between
PPAR
and
tumorigenesis

Pemetrexed
is
a

inhibitor

Methylthioadenosine

MTAP
)
salvages
purines
by
releasing
adenine

and
is

.

The
current
study
addresses
the
effect
of
MTAP
on
pemetrexed
activity
using
a
highly
potent
transition
state
inhibitor
of
MTAP

Based
on

protection
,
TS
was
found
to
be
the
primary
pemetrexed
target
in
both
cell
lines
with
GARFT
inhibition
requiring
20-
to
30-fold
higher
pemetrexed
concentrations
.

ImmA
had
no
effect
on
pemetrexed
activity
but
,
when
thymidine
was
added
,
the
pemetrexed
IC
(
50
)
decreased
by
a
factor
of
approximately
3
in
MTAP
(
+
)
H28
cells
with
no
effect
in
MTAP
(
-
)
H2052
cells
.

Conversely
,
the
transfection
of
MTAP
into
H2052
cells
increased
the
pemetrexed
IC
(
50
)
by
nearly
3-fold
but
only
in
the
presence
of
thymidine;
this
was
reversed
by
ImmA
.

An
MTAP-specific
short
interfering
RNA
produced
a
2-fold
decrease
in
pemetrexed
IC
(
50
)
in
MTAP
(

)

cells
in
the
presence

These
data
indicate
that
suppression
of
constitutive
MTAP
has
no
effect
on
pemetrexed
activity
when
the
primary
target
is
TS
.

There
is
a
modest
salutary
effect

However
,
the

than
that
of

Pre-equilibrium

The
hypolipidemic

of
thymoquinone
(

and
limonene
(

were
investigated
by
giving
1
ml
of
10mg
TQ

200mg
LMN
suspension
,
by
gavage
in
two
equal
doses
(

)
of
0

5
ml
each
for
30
days
,
in
rats
,
fed
an

.

These
compounds
effectively
ameliorated
all
the
altered
cardiovascular
risk
parameters
via
a
reduction
in
HMG-CoA
reductase
activity
,
along
with
an
increase
in
arylesterase
activity
.

The
compounds
significantly
blocked
the
shift
in
buoyancy
from
less
atherogenic
lb-LDL
to
highly
atherogenic
sd-LDL
,
restoring
the
percent
distribution
of
LDL-C
and
apoB
into
sd-LDL
and
lb-LDL
to
near
normal
levels
.

These
compounds
also
blocked
basal

malondialdehyde
,
and
lengthened
the
lag
times
of
LDL
,
sd-LDL
and

in
the

Our
results
strongly
suggest
an
important
therapeutic
use
of

,
in
the

)
,
short

,
and
long

(

)
.

These
NPs
were
used
to
investigate
the
effect
of
NP
shape
and
length
on
lung
toxicity
.

Mice
were
exposed
(
0-30
µg
per
mouse
)
by
pharyngeal
aspiration
and
pulmonary
toxicity
was
assessed
over
a
112-day
time
course
.

Whole
lung
lavage
data
indicated
that
NB1-
and
NB2-exposed
mice
,
but
not
NS-exposed
mice
,
had
significant
dose-
and
time-dependent
pulmonary
inflammation
and
damage
.

Histopathological
analyses
at
112
days
postexposure
determined
no
interstitial
fibrosis
in
any
NS-exposed
mice
,
an
increased
incidence
in
30
µg
NB1-exposed
mice
,
and
significant
interstitial
fibrosis
in
30
µg
NB2-exposed
mice
.

At
112
days
postexposure
,
lung
burden
of
NS
was
decreased
by
96
.
4%
and
NB2
by
80
.
5%
from
initial
deposition
levels
.

At
112
days
postexposure
,
enhanced
dark

microscopy
determined
that
alveolar
macro-
phages
were
the
dominant
deposition
site
,
but
a
fraction
of
NB1
and
NB2
was
observed
in
the
alveolar
interstitial
spaces
.

For
the
30
µg
exposure
groups
at
112
days
postexposure
,
confocal
micro-
scopy
and
immunofluorescent
staining
demonstrated
that
retained

were
present
in
the
interstitium
subjacent
to
the
terminal
bronchiole
near
the
normal
location
of
the
smallest
lymphatic
capillaries
in
the

.

These
lymphatic
capillaries
play
a
critical
role
in
particle
clearance
,
and
the
accumulation
of
NB2
,
but
not
NS
,
suggests
possible
impaired
lymphatic
clearance
by
the

This
study
provides
the
first
attempt
to
analyse
the
influence
of
ammonium
supplements
on
sugar-cane
juice
fermentation
and
the
flavour
profile
in
a
cachaça
industrial
process
.

The
objective
was
to
find
a
relationship
between
higher
alcohol
/
ester
content
and
the
transcription
levels
of
the
main
genes
involved
in
production
of
these
compounds
under
cachaça
fermentation
.

Sugar-cane
juice
with
a
low
amount
of
assimilable
nitrogen
(
81
mg
N
/
L
)
,
was
further
supplemented
with
mid-range
or
high
concentrations
of
ammonium
sulfate
.

Overall
,
higher
alcohol
production
was
reduced
by
ammonium
supplementation
,
and
this
can
be
correlated
with
a
general
downregulation
of
genes
encoding
decarboxylases
and
dehydrogenases
of
the
Ehrlich
pathway
.

The
production
of
acetate
esters
was
enhanced
by
mid-range
ammonium
supplementation
and
the
production
of
acyl
esters
by
high
ammonium
supplementation
.

The
acyl
esters
could
be
correlated
with
expression
of
alcohol
acyl-transferase
EEB1
and
the
acyl
esterase
IAH1
.

Fatty
acids
are
endogenous
ligands
of
peroxisome
proliferator-activated
receptor-alpha
(
PPARα
)
,
which
is
linked
to
the
regulation
of
fatty
acid
uptake
,
lipid
metabolism
and
breast
cancer
cell
growth
.

This
study
was
designed
to
screen
candidate
fatty
acids
from
breast
cancer
tissue
and
to
investigate
the
effects
of
these
candidate
fatty
acids
on
PPARα
expression
,
cell
growth
and
cell
cycle
progression
in
breast
cancer
cell
lines
.

One
breast
cancer
tissue
and
one
reference
tissue
were
each
taken
from
30
individual
breasts
to
examine
for
fatty
acid
composition
and
PPARα
expression
.

The
cancer
cell
lines
MDA-MB-231
(
ER-
)
,
MCF-7
(
ER

+
+
+
)
and
BT-474
(
ER
+
+
)
were
used
to
explore
the
mechanisms
regulating
cell
proliferation
.

We
found
that
arachidonic
acid
(
AA
)
and
PPARα
were
highly
expressed
in
the
breast
cancer
tissues
.

AA
stimulated
the
growth
of
all
three
breast
cancer
cells
in
a
time-
and
dose-dependent
manner
.

The
growth
stimulatory
effect
of
AA
was
associated
with
PPARα
activation
,
and
the
most
potent
effect
was
found
in
MCF-7
cells
.

The
stimulation
of
cell
proliferation
by
AA
was
accompanied
by
the
increased
expression
of
cyclin
E
,
a
reduced
population
of
G1
phase
cells
,
and
a
faster
G1
/
S
phase
transition
.

In
contrast
,
AA
had
no
effects
on
the
levels
of
CDK2
,
CDK4
,
cyclin
D1
,
p27
,
Bcl-2
and
Bax
.

Our
results
demonstrate
that
high
levels
of
AA
and
PPARα
expression
in
human
breast
cancer
tissues
are
associated
with
ER-overexpressed
breast
cancer
cell
proliferation
,
which
is
involved
in
activating
PPARα
,
stimulating
cyclin
E
expression
,
and
promoting
faster
G1
/
S
transition
.
A
novel
method
for
the
manufacture
of
protein
/
peptide-containing
submicron
particles
was
developed
in
an
attempt
to
provide
particles
with
increased
activity
while
using
high
energy
input
technologies
.

The
method
consists
of
antisolvent
co-precipitation
from
an
aqueous
solution
containing
both
an
amino
acid
core
material
(
e
.

g
.

D
,
L-valine
)
,
and
either
bovine
serum
albumin
(
BSA
)
or
lysozyme
(
Lys
)
as
model
proteins
.

The
aqueous
solution
was
added
to
the
organic
phase
by
means
of
a
nebulizer
to
increase
the
total
surface
area
of
interaction
for
the
precipitation
process
.

Sonication
proved
to
be
an
effective
method
to
produce
small
particle
sizes
while
maintaining
high
activity
of
Lys
.

The
use
of
a
polysorbate
or
sorbitan
ester
derivatives
as
stabilizers
proved
to
be
necessary
to
yield
submicron
particles
.

Particles
with
very
high
yields
(
approximately
100%
)
and
very
high
activity
after
manufacture
(
approximately
100%
)
could
be
obtained
.

A
particle
size
of
439
.
0
nm
,
with
a
yield
of
48
.
8%
and
with
final
remaining
activity
of98
.
7%
was
obtained
.

By
studying
various
factors
using
a
design
of
experiments
strategy
(
DoE
)
we
were
able
to
establish
the
critical
controlling
factors
for
this
new
method
of
manufacture
.
Cellular
growth
and
differentiation
are
readouts
of
multiple
signaling
pathways
from
the
intercellular
and
/
or
extracellular
milieu
.

The
extracellular
matrix
through
the
activation
of
cellular
receptors
transmits
these
signals
.

Therefore
,
extracellular
matrix
proteolysis
could
affect
cell
fate
in
a
variety
of
biological
events
.

However
,
the
biological
consequence
of
inadequate
extracellular
matrix
degradation
in
vivo
is
not
clear
.

We
developed
a
mouse
model
expressing
human
collagenase
(
matrix
metalloproteinase-1
,
MMP-1
)
under
the
control
of
Col2a1
promoter
.

The
mice
showed
significant
growth
retardation
during
embryogenesis
and
a
loss
of
the
demarcation
of
zonal
structure
and
columnar
array
of
the
cartilage
.

Immunological
examination
revealed
increased
degradation
of
type
II
collagen
and
upregulation
of
fibronectin
and
alpha
(
5
)
-integrin
subunit
in
the
transgenic
cartilage
.

The
resting
zone
and
proliferating
zone
of
the
growth
plate
cartilage
exhibited
a
simultaneous
increase
in
bromodeoxyuridine
(
BrdU
)
-incorporated
proliferating
cells
and
terminal
deoxynucleotidyl
transferase-mediated
X-dUTP
nick-end
labeling-positive
apoptotic
cells
,
respectively
.

Chondrocyte
differentiation
was
not
disturbed
in
the
transgenic
mice
as
evidenced
by
normal
expression
of
the
Ihh
and
type
X
collagen
expression
.

These
data
demonstrate
that
type
II
collagen
proteolysis
is
an
important
determinant
for
the
skeletal
outgrowth
through
modulation
of
chondrocyte
survival
and
cartilagenous
growth
.

Adenylosuccinate
synthetase
(
AdSS
)
catalyzes
the
Mg2
+
dependent
condensation
of
a
molecule
of
IMP
with
aspartate
to
form
adenylosuccinate
,
in
a
reaction
driven
by
the
hydrolysis
of
GTP
to
GDP
.

AdSS
from
the
thermophilic
archaea
,
Methanocaldococcus
jannaschii
(
MjAdSS
)
is
345
amino
acids
long
against
an
average
length
of
430-457
amino
acids
for
most
mesophilic
AdSS
.

This
short
AdSS
has
two
large
deletions
that
map
to
the
middle
and
C-terminus
of
the
protein
.

This
article
discusses
the
detailed
kinetic
characterization
of
MjAdSS
.

Initial
velocity
and
product
inhibition
studies
,
carried
out
at
70
degrees
C
,
suggest
a
rapid
equilibrium
random
AB
steady-state
ordered
C
kinetic
mechanism
for
the
MjAdSS
catalyzed
reaction
.

AdSS
are
known
to
exhibit
monomer-dimer
equilibrium
with
the
dimer
being
implicated
in
catalysis
.

In
contrast
,
our
studies
show
that
MjAdSS
is
an
equilibrium
mixture
of
dimers
and
tetramers
with
the
tetramer
being
the
catalytically
active
form
.

The
tetramer
dissociates
into
dimers
with
a
minor
increase
in
ionic
strength
of
the
buffer
,
while
the
dimer
is
extremely
stable
and
does
not
dissociate
even
at
1

M
NaCl

Phosphate
,
a
product
of
the
reaction
,
was
found
to
be
a
potent
inhibitor
of
MjAdSS
showing
biphasic
inhibition
of
enzyme
activity
.

The
inhibition
was
competitive
with
IMP
and
noncompetitive
with
GTP
.

MjAdSS
,
like

mouse
acidic
isozyme
,
exhibits
substrate

Mosquitoes
are
vectors
of
several
major
human
diseases
and
their
control
is
mainly
based
on
the
use
of
chemical
insecticides
.

Resistance
of
mosquitoes
to
organochlorines
,
organophosphates
,
carbamates
and
pyrethroids
led
to
a
regain
of
interest
for
the
use
of
neonicotinoid
insecticides
in
vector
control
.

The
present
study
investigated
the
molecular
basis
of
neonicotinoid
resistance
in
the
mosquito
Aedes
aegypti
.

A
strain
susceptible
to
insecticides
was
selected
at
the
larval
stage
with
imidacloprid
.

After
eight
generations
of
selection
,
larvae
of
the
selected
strain
(
Imida-R
)
showed
a
5
.
4-fold
increased
tolerance
to
imidacloprid
while
adult
tolerance
level
remained
low
.

Imida-R
larvae
showed
significant
cross-tolerance
to
other
neonicotinoids
but
not
to
pyrethroids
,
organophosphates
and
carbamates
.

Transcriptome
profiling
identified
344
and
108
genes
differentially
transcribed
in
larvae
and
adults
of
the
Imida-R
strain
compared
to
the
parental
strain
.

Most
of
these
genes
encode
detoxification
enzymes
,
cuticle
proteins
,
hexamerins
as
well
as
other
proteins
involved
in
cell
metabolism
.

Among
detoxification
enzymes
,
cytochrome
P450
monooxygenases
(
CYPs
)
and
glucosyl
/
glucuronosyl
transferases
(
UDPGTs
)
were
over-represented
.

Bioassays
with
enzyme
inhibitors
and
biochemical
assays
confirmed
the
contribution
of
P450s
with
an
increased
capacity
of
the
Imida-R
microsomes
to
metabolize
imidacloprid
in
presence
of
NADPH
.

Comparison
of
substrate
recognition
sites

six
CYP6s

the
Imida-R

with
Bemisia

CYP6CM1vQ
and
Drosophila
melanogaster
CYP6G1
,
both
able
to
metabolize
imidacloprid
,
suggested
that
CYP6BB2
and
CYP6N12
are
good
candidates
for
imidacloprid
metabolism
in
Ae
.

aegypti
.

The
present
study
revealed
that
imidacloprid
tolerance
in
mosquitoes
can
arise
after
few
generations
of
selection
at
the
larval
stage
but
does
not
lead
to
a
significant
tolerance
of
adults
.

As
in
other
insects
,
P450-mediated
insecticide
metabolism
appears
to
play
a
major
role
in
imidacloprid
tolerance
in
mosquitoes
.
Tissue
factor
pathway
inhibitor
(
TFPI
)
is
released
to
circulating
blood
after
intravenous
and
subcutaneous
injections
of
heparins
,
and
may
thus
contribute
to
the
antithrombotic
effect
of
heparins
.

A
previous
study
suggested
different
abilities
of
various
low
molecular
weight
heparins
(
LMWH
)
to
release
endogenous
TFPI
,
but
the
dose-response
relationship
was
not
determined
.

In
the
present
study
,
the
dose-response
relationship
for
escalating
doses
of
two
LMWHs
,
dalteparin
and
enoxaparin
,
on
the
release
of
endogenous
TFPI
was
investigated
.

Six
healthy
male
participants
were
given
50
,
100
and
200
U

kg
dalteparin
and
0
.
5
,
1

0
and
2
.
0
mg
/
kg
enoxaparin
as
a
single
subcutaneous
injection
.

The
study
was
a
randomized
,
cross-over
design
with
a
1-week
wash-out
period
between
each
injection
.

Peak
free
TFPI
antigen
and
TFPI
activity
were
detected
after
only
1
h
,
whereas
anti-activated
factor
X
(
anti-FXa
)
and
anti-activated
factor
II
(
anti-FIIa
)
activities
were
detected
after
2-6
h
.

Putative
therapeutic
equivalent
doses
of
dalteparin
and
enoxaparin
gave
similar
release
of
endogenous
TFPI
,
but
dissimilar
effects
on
anti-FXa
and
anti-FIIa
activities
.
An
antioxidant
microgel
with
both
glutathione
peroxidase
(
GPx
)
and
superoxide
dismutase
(
SOD
)
activities
is
reported
.

Using
computational
design
and
genetic
engineering
methods
,
the
main
catalytic
components
of
GPx
are
fabricated
onto
the
surface
of
ferritin
.

The
resulting
seleno-ferritin
(
Se-Fn
)
monomers
can
self-assemble
into
nanocomposites
that
exhibit
remarkable
GPx
activity
due
to
the
well
organized
multi-GPx
catalytic
centers
.

Subsequently
,
a
porphyrin
derivative
is
synthesized
as
an
SOD
mimic
,
and
is
employed
to
construct
a
synergistic
dual
enzyme
system
by
crosslinking
Se-Fn
nanocomposites
into
a
microgel
.

Significantly
,
this
dual
enzyme
microgel
is
demonstrated
to
display
better
antioxidant
ability
than
single
GPx
or
SOD
mimics
in
protecting
cells
from
oxidative
damage
.

Auranofin
,
an
antirheumatic
gold
compound
,
is
an
inhibitor
of
selenocysteine
enzymes
,
such
as
thioredoxin
reductase
and
glutathione
peroxidase
.

These
enzymes
play
an
important
role
in
protecting
cardiac
tissue
from
oxidative
stress
generated
during
ischaemia-reperfusion
.

Auranofin
(
100
mg
/
kg
)
was
administered
to
rats
and
their
hearts
were
subjected
to
an
in

model
of
ischaemia-reperfusion
.

The
activity
of
thioredoxin
reductase
and
glutathione
peroxidase
was
determined
in
liver
and
heart
tissues
in
an
attempt
to
correlate
enzymatic
activity
with
heart
recovery
after
ischaemia-reperfusion
.

There
was
significantly
less
thioredoxin
reductase
activity
in
rat
liver
extracts
,
whereas
the
level
of
glutathione
activity
remained
unchanged
,
demonstrating
that
the
dose
of
auranofin
used
was
able
to
selectively
inhibit
one
of
these
enzyme
systems
.

Rats
administered
auranofin
displayed
significantly
impaired
recovery
from
ischaemic
insult
.

The
end
diastolic
pressure
was
increased
,
whereas
the
rate

was
significantly
decreased
.

The
level
of
postischaemic
apoptosis
was
also
assessed
by
examining
caspase-3
activity
in
tissue
homogenates
.

Auranofin
significantly
increased
the
degree
of
postischaemic
apoptosis
,
leading
to
poor
postischaemic
recovery
.
Drug
delivery
to
the
brain
is
becoming
more
and
more
important
but
is
severely
restricted
by
the
blood-brain
barrier
.

Nanoparticles
coated
with
polysorbates
have
previously
been
shown
to
enable
the
transport
of
several
drugs
across
the
blood-brain
barrier
,
which
under
normal
circumstances
is
impermeable
to
these
compounds
.

Apolipoprotein
E
was
suggested
to
mediate
this
drug
transport
across
the
blood-brain
barrier
.

In
the
present
study
,
apolipoprotein
E
was
coupled
by
chemical
methods
to
nanoparticles
made
of
human
serum
albumin
(
HSA-NP
)
.

Loperamide
,
which
does
not
cross
the
blood-brain
barrier
but
exerts
antinociceptive
effects
after
direct
injection
into
the

,
was
used
as
model
drug
.

Apolipoprotein
E
was
chemically
bound
via
linkers
to
loperamide-loaded
HSA-NP
.

This
preparation
induced
antinociceptive

In
contrast
,
nanoparticles
linked
to
apolipoprotein

variants
that
do
not

failed
to
induce
these
effects
.

These
results
indicate
that
apolipoprotein
E
attached
to
the
surface
of
nanoparticles
facilitates
transport
of
drugs
across
the
blood-brain

,
probably
after

Acetylcholinesterase
(
AChE
)
is
one
of
nature's
fastest
enzymes
,
despite
the
fact
that
its
three-dimensional
structure
reveals
its
active
site
to
be
deeply
sequestered
within
the
molecule
.

This
raises
questions
with
respect
to
traffic
of
substrate
to
,
and
products
from
,
the
active
site
,
which
may
be
investigated
by
time-resolved
crystallography
.

In
order
to
address
one
aspect
of
the
feasibility
of
performing
time-resolved
studies
on
AChE
,
a
data
set
has
been
collected
using
the
Laue
technique
on
a
trigonal
crystal
of
Torpedo
californica
AChE
soaked
with
the
reversible
inhibitor
edrophonium
,
using
a
total
X-ray
exposure
time
of

Electron-density
maps
obtained
from
the
Laue
data
,
which
are
of
surprisingly
good
quality
compared
with
similar
maps
from
monochromatic
data
,
show
essentially
the
same
features
.

They
clearly
reveal
the

ligand
,
as
well
as
a
structural
change
in
the
conformation
of
the

Fulvestrant
(
Faslodex
)
is
a
novel
estrogen
receptor
(
ER
)
antagonist
that
competitively
binds
to
the
ER
with
a
much
greater
affinity
than
that
of
tamoxifen
.

The
downregulation
of
cellular
levels
of
the
ER
protein
results
in
complete
abrogation
of
estrogen-sensitive
gene
transcription
.

This
distinct
mechanism
of
action
ensures
a
lack
of
cross
resistance
with
other
hormonal
agents
and
,
in
contrast
to
tamoxifen
,
fulvestrant
has
no
known
estrogen-agonist
effects
.

Fulvestrant
is
administered
via
monthly
intramuscular
injections
(
250mg
)
and
is
recommended
for
the
treatment
of
hormone
receptor-positive
metastatic
breast
cancer
in
postmenopausal
women
with
disease
progression
following
antiestrogen
therapy
.

The
efficacy
of
fulvestrant
was
similar
to
that
of
the
aromatase
inhibitor
anastrozole
(
1
mg
/
day
)
in
two
,
well
designed
studies
in
postmenopausal
women
with
locally
advanced
or
metastatic
breast
cancer
that
had
progressed
during
prior
antiestrogen
therapy
.

Time
to
disease
progression
(
primary
endpoint
)
and
treatment
failure
,
rates
of
objective
response
and
clinical
benefit
,
overall
survival
and
quality
of
life
were
similar
in
patients
treated
with
fulvestrant
or
anastrozole
.

In
retrospective
noninferiority
analyses
,
fulvestrant
was
at
least
as
effective
as
anastrozole
in
all
randomised
patients
,
and
in
those
with
or
without
visceral
metastases
.

Fulvestrant
is
generally
well
tolerated
and
was
tolerated
as
well
as
anastrozole
in
clinical
trials
.

Treatment-related
adverse
events
were
mostly
mild
to
moderate
and
led
to
treatment
withdrawal
in
about
1%
of
patients
who
received
fulvestrant
or
anastrozole
.

The
main
adverse
effects
associated
with
therapy
are
nausea
,
asthenia
,
pain
,
vasodilation
and
headache
.

In
conclusion
,
monthly
intramuscular
injections
of
fulvestrant
are
at
least
as
effective
and
as
well
tolerated
as
oral
anastrozole
once
daily
in
the
treatment
of
postmenopausal
women
with
advanced
breast
cancer
that
has
progressed
on
prior
antiestrogen
therapy
.

Because
of
a
different
mode
of
action
to
that
of
other
hormonal
agents
,
fulvestrant
is
effective
in
the
treatment
of
tamoxifen-resistant
disease
and
,
unlike
tamoxifen
,
has
no
known
estrogen
agonist
effects
.

Thus
,
fulvestrant
provides
an
effective
and
well
tolerated
option
for
the
treatment
of
hormone
receptor-positive
metastatic
breast
cancer
in
postmenopausal
women
with
disease
progression
following
antiestrogen
therapy

,
and

.

The
binding
profiles
for
the
agonists

were
found
to
be
similar
.

For
both
agonists
,
important
binding
domains
were
the
extracellular
N-terminus
(
=

)
and
the
extracellular
loops

from
the

.

For
the
vasopressin

/
oxytocin
receptor
antagonist

,
none
of
the
receptor
constructs
were
able
to
provide
a
binding
with
higher
affinity
than
the
starting
vasopressin

receptor
.

In
contrast
,
the
binding
of
barusiban
was
significantly
improved
when
the
transmembrane
domains
1
and
2
were
transferred
from
the
oxytocin

The
scientific
rationale
of
pharmacologically
inhibiting
phosphodiesterase
type
5
(
PDE5
)
in
the
treatment
of
erectile
dysfunction
(
ED
)
is
reviewed
.

Published
literature
on
the
nitric
oxide-cyclic
guanosine
monophosphate
(
cGMP
)
pathway
for
penile
erection
and
on
PDE5
inhibition
using
sildenafil
as
the
model
for
pharmacologic
PDE5
inhibition
are
assessed
.

The
key
second
messenger
in
the
mediation
of
penile
erection
is
cGMP
.

PDE5
is
the
predominant
PDE
in
the
corpus
cavernosum
,
and
cGMP
is
its
primary
substrate
.

Therefore
,
in
men
with
ED
,
elevation
of
cGMP
in
corpus
cavernosal
tissue
via
selective
inhibition
of
cGMP-specific
PDE5
is
a
means
of
improving
erectile
function
at
minimal
risk
of
adverse
events
.

This
approach
is
validated
by
the
clinical
efficacy
and
safety
of
sildenafil
,
the
pioneering
drug
for
selective
PDE5
inhibitor
therapy
for
ED
.

Sildenafil
exhibits
inhibitory
potency
against
PDE5
and
a
10-fold
lower
dose-related
inhibitory
potency
against
rod
outer
segment
PDE6
,
the
predominant
PDE
in
the
phototransduction
cascade
in
rods
.

Thus
,
its
pharmacologic
profile
is
predictable
,
with
close
correlation
between
pharmacodynamic
and
pharmacokinetic
properties
.

Clinically
,
sildenafil
improves
erectile
function
in
a
large
percentage
of
men
with
ED
.

The
most
common
adverse
events
are
due
to
PDE5
inhibition
in
vascular
and
visceral
smooth
muscle;
similar
adverse
events
are
expected
during
therapeutic
use
of
all
PDE5
inhibitors
.

retinal
PDE6
,
usually
at
higher
therapeutic
doses
,
transient
,
reversible
visual
adverse
events
can
occur
,
albeit
infrequently
.

Selective
inhibition
of
PDE5
is
a
rational
therapeutic
approach
in
ED
,
as
proved
by
the
clinical
success
of
sildenafil
.
Arginine
decarboxylase

the
biosynthesis
of
putrescine
,
which
is
the
precursor
of
other
polyamines
in
animals
,
plants
,
and
bacteria
.

These
pyridoxal-5'-phosphate-dependent
decarboxylases
belong
to
the
alanine
racemase
(
AR
)
structural
family
together
with
diaminopimelate
decarboxylase
(
DapDC
)
,
which
catalyzes
the

step
of

biosynthesis
in

.

We
have
constructed
a
multiple-sequence
alignment
of
decarboxylases
in
the
AR
structural
family
and
,
based
on
the
alignment
,
inferred

trees
.

The
phylogenetic
tree
consists
of
3
distinct
clades
formed
by
ADC
,
DapDC
,
and
ODC
that
diverged
from
an
ancestral
decarboxylase
.

The
ancestral
decarboxylase
probably
was
able
to
recognize
several
substrates
,
and
in
archaea
and
bacteria
,
ODC
may
have
retained
the
ability
to
bind
other
amino
acids
.

Previously
,
a
paralogue
of
ODC
has
been
proposed
to
account
for
ADC
activity
detected
in
mammalian

According
to

results
,
this
appears
unlikely
,
emphasizing
the
need
for
more
caution
in
functional
assignment
made
using

illustrating
the

series
of
analogues
of
propranolol
with
structural
variation
in
the
oxypropanolamine
moiety
was
synthesized
,
and
affinities
for
wild-type
and
Asn386Val
mutant
5-HT1A
receptors
were
determined
.

Both
the
hydroxyl
and
the
ether
oxygen
atoms
of
the
oxypropanol
moiety
seem
to
be
required
for
binding
at
wild-type
5-HT1A
receptors
.

The
hydroxyl
group
of
propranolol
probably
directly
interacts
with
Asn386
.

The
ether
oxygen
atom
may
be
important
for
steric
reasons
but
can
also
be
involved
in
a
direct
interaction
with
Asn386
.

These
findings
are
in
agreement
with
the
interactions
of
aryloxypropanolamines
with
Asn386
in
rat
5-HT1A
receptors
that
we
previously
proposed
.

The
loss
of
affinity
for
propranolol
by
the
Asn386Val
mutation
could
be
regained
by
replacement
of
the
hydroxyl
group
of
the
ligand
by
a
methoxy
group
.

This
modification
of
the
propranolol
structure
has
no
effect
on
the
affinity
of
both
enantiomers
for
the
wild-type
5-HT1A
receptor
,
which
provides
an
alternative
hypothesis
for
the
interaction
of
Asn386
with
the
oxypropanol
oxygen
atoms
.

According
to
this
novel
hypothesis
,
the
oxypropanol
oxygen
atoms
may
both
act
as
hydrogen
bond
acceptors
from
the
NH2
group
of
Asn386
.
Introduction
:
5-Lipoxygenase
(
5-LO
)
is
a
crucial
enzyme
of
the
arachidonic
acid
(
AA
)
cascade
and
catalyzes
the
formation
of
bioactive
leukotrienes
(
LTs
)
with
the
help
of
FLAP
,
the
5-LO-activating
protein
.

LTs
are
inflammatory
mediators
playing
a
pathophysiological
role
in
different
diseases
like
asthma
,
allergic
rhinitis
as
well
as
cardiovascular
diseases
and
certain
types
of
cancer
.

With
the
rising
number
of
indications
for
anti-LT
therapy
,
5-LO
inhibitor
drug
development
becomes
increasingly
important
.

Areas
covered
:
Here
,
both
recent
findings
regarding
the
pathophysiological
role
of
5-LO
and
the
patents
claimed
for
5-LO
inhibitors
are
discussed
.

Focusing
on
direct
inhibitors
,
several
patents
disclosing
FLAP
antagonists
are
also
subject
of
this
review
.

Novel
compounds
include
1
,
5-diarylpyrazoles
,
indolizines
and
indoles
and
several
natural
product
extracts
.

Expert
opinion
:
Evaluation
of
the
patent
activities
revealed
only
quite
moderate
action
.

Nevertheless
,
several
auspicious
drug-like
molecules
were
disclosed
.

It
seems
that
in
the
near
future
,
FLAP
inhibitors
can
be
expected
to
enter
the
market
for
the
treatment
of
asthma
.

With
the
resolved
structure
of
5-LO
,
structure-based
drug
design
is
now
applicable
.

Together
with
the
identification
of
downstream
enzyme
inhibitors
and
dual-targeting
drugs
within
the
AA
cascade
,
several
tools
are
at
hand
to
cope
with
5-LOs
increasing
pathophysiological
roles
.
In
the
present
investigation
,
16
new
rotundic
acid
(
RA
)
derivatives
modified
at
the
C-3
,
C-23
and
C-28
positions
were
synthesized
.

The
cytotoxicities
of
the
derivatives
were
evaluated
against
HeLa
,
A375
,
HepG2
,
SPC-A1
and
NCI-H446
human
tumor
cell
lines
by
MTT
assay
.

Among
these
derivatives
,
compounds
4-7
exhibited
stronger
cell
growth
inhibitory
than
RA
and
compound
4
was
found
to
be
the
best
inhibition
activity
on
five
human
tumor
cell
lines
with
IC50
<10μM
.

The
apoptosis
mechanism
of
compound
4
in
HeLa
cells
was
investigated
by
western
blot
analysis
.

The
results
indicated
that
compound
4
could
induce
apoptosis
through
increasing
protein
expression
of
cleaved
caspase-3
and
Bax
,
and
decreasing
protein
expression
of
Bcl-2
.

In
summary
,
the
present
work
suggests
that
compound
4
might
serve
as
an
effective
chemotherapeutic
candidate
.
Activins
are
multifunctional
growth
and
differentiation
factors
and
stimulate
FSH-beta
gene
expression
and
FSH
secretion
by
the
pituitary
gonadotropes
.

Follistatins
bind
activin
,
resulting
in
the
neutralization
of
activin
bioactivity
.

The
activin
/
follistatin
system
is
present
in
the
prostate
tissue
.

Prostate-specific
antigen
(
PSA
)
plays
an
important
role
in
male
reproductive
physiology
as
well
as
being
very
important
as
a
tumor
marker
for
prostate
cancer
.

Thus
the
regulation
of
PSA
has
important
clinical
implications
.

Previous
studies
showed
that
PSA
is
primarily
regulated
by
androgens
.

In
the
present
study
,
we
evaluated
the
direct
effects
of
activin
A
on
the
proliferation
and
PSA
production
of
prostate
cancer
LNCaP
cells
,
which
express
functional
activin
receptors
and
androgen
receptor
and
PSA
.

LNCaP
cells
were
treated
with
activin
A
and
5alpha-dihydrotestosterone
(
DHT
)
with
or
without
their
antagonists
(
follistatin
or
the
nonsteroidal
anti-androgen
bicalutamide
)
.

Activin
A
decreased
cell
growth
of
LNCaP
cells
in
a
dose-dependent
manner
,
whereas
DHT
increased
it
in
a
biphasic
manner
.

In
contrast
to
their
opposing
actions
on
cell
growth
,
both
activin
A
and
DHT
upregulated
PSA
gene
expression
and
increased
PSA
secretion
by
LNCaP
cells
.

The
effects
of
activin
A
and
DHT
to
increase
PSA
production
were
synergistic
or
additive
.

Follistatin
or
bicalutamide
was
without
effect
on
cell
growth
or
PSA
production
.

The
effects
of
activin
A
on
LNCaP
cells
were
blocked
by
follistatin
,
not
by
bicalutamide
,
whereas
effects
of
DHT
were
prevented
by
bicalutamide
,
not
by
follistatin
.

Activin
A
upregulates
PSA
production
,
and
the
effect
is
through
an
androgen
receptor-independent
pathway
.

The
activin
/
follistatin
system
can
be
a
physiological
modulator
of
PSA
gene
transcription
and
secretion
in
the
prostate
tissue
,
and
activins
may
cooperate
with
androgen
to
upregulate
PSA
in
vivo
.
Sir2
is
an
evolutionarily
conserved
NAD
(
+
)
-dependent
deacetylase
which
has
been
shown
to
play
a
critical
role
in
glucose
and
fat
metabolism
.

In
this
study
,
we
have
perturbed
Drosophila
Sir2
(
dSir2
)
expression
,
bidirectionally
,
in
muscles
and
the
fat
body
.

We
report
that
dSir2
plays
a
critical
role
in
insulin
signaling
,
glucose
homeostasis
,
and
mitochondrial
functions
.

Importantly
,
we
establish
the
nonautonomous
functions
of
fat
body
dSir2
in
regulating
mitochondrial
physiology
and
insulin
signaling
in
muscles
.

We
have
identified
a
novel
interplay
between
dSir2
and
dFOXO
at
an
organismal
level
,
which
involves
Drosophila
insulin-like
peptide
(
dILP
)
-dependent
insulin
signaling
.

By
genetic
perturbations
and
metabolic
rescue
,
we
provide
evidence
to
illustrate
that
fat
body
dSir2
mediates
its
effects
on
the
muscles
via
free
fatty
acids
(
FFA
)
and
dILPs
(
from
the
insulin-producing
cells
[
IPCs
]
)
.

In
summary
,
we
show
that
fat
body
dSir2
is
a
master
regulator
of
organismal
energy
homeostasis
and
is
required
for
maintaining
the
metabolic
regulatory
network
across
tissues
.

Ziprasidone
is
a
novel
antipsychotic
agent
which
binds
with
high
affinity
to
5-HT1A
receptors
(
Ki
=
3
.
4
nM
)
,
in
addition
to
5-HT1D
,
5-HT2
,
and
D2
sites
.

While
it
is
an
antagonist
at
these
latter
receptors
,
ziprasidone
behaves
as
a
5-HT1A
agonist
in
vitro
in
adenylate
cyclase
measurements
.

The
goal
of
the
present
study
was
to
examine
the
5-HT1A
properties
of
ziprasidone
in
vivo
using
as
a
marker
of
central
5-HT1A
activity
the
inhibition
of
firing
of
serotonin-containing
neurons
in
the
dorsal
raphe
nucleus
.

In
anesthetized
rats
,
ziprasidone
dose-dependently
slowed
raphe
unit
activity
(
ED50
=
300
micrograms
/
kg
i
.

v
.

)
as
did
the
atypical
antipsychotics
clozapine
(
ED50
=
250
micrograms
/
kg
i
.

v
.

)
and
olanzapine
(
ED50
=
1000
micrograms
/
kg
i
.

v
.

)
.

Pretreatment
with
the
5-HT1A
antagonist
WAY-100
,
635
(
10
micrograms

i
.

v
.

)
prevented
the
ziprasidone-induced
inhibition;
the
same
dose
of
WAY-100
,
635
had
little
effect
on
the
inhibition
produced
by
clozapine
and
olanzapine
.

Because
all
three
agents
also
bind
to
alpha
1
receptors
,
antagonists
of
which
inhibit
serotonin
neuronal
firing
,
this
aspect
of
their
pharmacology
was
assessed
with
desipramine
(
DMI
)
,
a
NE
re-uptake
blocker
previously
shown
to
reverse
the
effects
of
alpha
1
antagonists
on
raphe
unit
activity
.

DMI
(
5
mg
/
kg
i
.

v
.

)
failed
to
reverse
the
inhibitory
effect
of
ziprasidone
but
produced
nearly
complete
reversal
of
that
of
clozapine
and
olanzapine
.

These
profiles
suggest
a
mechanism
of
action
for
each
agent
,
5-HT1A
agonism
for
ziprasidone
and
alpha
1
antagonism
for
clozapine
and
olanzapine
.

The
5-HT1A
agonist
activity
reported
here
clearly
distinguishes
ziprasidone
from
currently
available
antipsychotic
agents
and
suggests
that
this
property
may
play
a
significant
role
in
its
pharmacologic
actions
.
Intolerance
reactions
to
acetyl
salicylic
acid
(
ASA
)
and
nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory
drugs
(
NSAIDs
)
are
common
and
caused
by
inhibition
of
COX-1
enzyme
.

Therefore
,
drugs
that
selectively
inhibit
COX-2
enzyme
may
be
safe
in
these
subjects
.

In
this
study
,
we
evaluated
the
tolerability
of
celecoxib
,
a
selective
COX-2
inhibitor
,
in
patients
with
analgesic
intolerance

divided
doses
of
placebo
and
celecoxib
(

were
given
with

intervals

Although
celecoxib

to
be
a

alternative

in

,
considering
its
serious

BDZs
and

modulators
,
including
barbiturates
,
ethanol
,
and
neurosteroids
,
can
also
inhibit
L-type
voltage-gated
calcium
channels
(
L-VGCCs
)
,
which
could
contribute
to
reduced
neuronal
excitability
.

Because
neuronal
L-VGCC
function
is
up-regulated
after
long-term

(

exposure
,
an
interaction
with

occurred
at

are

to

and
is
not

Obesity
and
non-insulin-dependent
diabetes
favor
storage
of
fatty
acids
in
triacylglycerol
over
oxidation
.

Recently
,
individual
acyl-CoA
synthetase
(
ACS
)
isoforms
have
been
implicated
in
the
channeling
of
fatty
acids
either
toward
lipid
synthesis
or
toward
oxidation
.

Although
ACS1
had
been
localized
to
three
different
subcellular
regions
in
rat
liver
,
endoplasmic
reticulum
,
mitochondria
,
and
peroxisomes
,
the
study
had
used
an
antibody
raised
against
the
full-length
ACS1
protein
which
cross-reacts
with
other
isoforms
,
probably
because
all
ACS
family
members
contain
highly
conserved
amino
acid
sequences
.

Therefore
,
we
examined
the
subcellular
location
of
ACS1
,
ACS4
,
and
ACS5
in
rat
liver
to
determine
which
isoform
was
present
in
peroxisomes
,
whether
the
ACSs
were
intrinsic
membrane
proteins
,
and
which
ACS
isoforms
were
up-regulated
by
PPAR
alpha
ligands
.

Non-cross-reacting
ACS1
,
ACS4
,
and
ACS5
peptide
antibodies
showed
that
ACS4
was
the
only
ACS
isoform
present
in
peroxisomes
isolated
from
livers
of
gemfibrozil-treated
rats
.

ACS4
was
also
present
in
fractions
identified
as
mitochondria-associated
membrane
(
MAM
)
.

ACS1
was
present
in
endoplasmic
reticulum
fractions
and
ACS5
was
present
in
mitochondrial
fractions
.

Incubation
with
troglitazone
,
a
specific
inhibitor
of
ACS4
,
decreased
ACS
activity
in
the
MAM
fractions
30-45%
and
in
the
peroxisomal
fractions
about
30%
.

Because
the
signal
for
ACS4
protein
in
peroxisomes
was
so
strong
compared
to
the
MAM
fraction
,
we
examined
ACS4
mRNA
abundance
in
livers
of
rats
treated
with
the
PPAR
alpha
agonist
GW9578
.

Treatment
with
GW9578
increased
ACS4
mRNA
abundance
40%
and
ACS1
mRNA
25%
.

Although
we
had
originally
proposed
that
ACS4
is
linked
to
triacylglycerol
synthesis
,
it
now
appears
that
ACS4
may
also
be
important
in
activating
fatty
acids
destined
for
peroxisomal
oxidation
.

We
also
determined
that
,
unlike
ACS1
and
5
,
ACS4
is
not
an
intrinsic
membrane
protein
.

This
suggests
that
ACS4
is
probably
targeted
and
linked
to
MAM
and
peroxisomes
by
interactions
with
other
proteins
.

QR2
catalyzes
the
two-electron
reduction
of
menadione
via
the
oxidation
of
N-alkylated
or
N-ribosylated
nicotinamides
.

To
investigate
the
mechanism
and
consequences
of
inhibition
of
QR2
by
the
quinolines
further
,
we
have
used
steady-state
and
transient-state
kinetics
to
define
the
mechanism
of
QR2
.

Importantly
,
we
have
shown
that
QR2
when
isolated
from
an
overproducing
strain
of
E
.

coli
is
kinetically
equivalent
to
the
enzyme
from
the
native
human
red
blood
cell
source
.

We
observe
ping-pong
kinetics
consistent
with
one
substrate
/
inhibitor
binding
site
that
shows
selectivity
for
the
oxidation
state
of
the
FAD
cofactor
,
suggesting
that
selective
inhibition
of
the
liver
versus
red
blood
cell
forms
of
malaria
may
be
possible
.

The
reductant
N-methyldihydronicotinamide
and
the
inhibitor
primaquine
bind
exclusively
to
the
oxidized
enzyme
.

In
contrast
,
the
inhibitors
quinacrine
and
chloroquine
bind
exclusively
to
the
reduced
enzyme
.

The
quinone
substrate
menadione
,
on
the
other
hand
,
binds
nonspecifically
to
both
forms
of
the
enzyme
.

Single-turnover
kinetics
of
the
reductive
half-reaction
are
chemically
and
kinetically
competent
and
confirm
the
inhibitor
selectivity
seen
in
the
steady-state
experiments
.

Our
studies
shed
light
on
the
possible
in
vivo
potency
of
the
quinolines
and
provide
a
foundation
for
future
studies
aimed
at
creating
more
potent
QR2
inhibitors
and
at
understanding
the
physiological
significance
of
QR2
.

,

AAPH
)
under
aerobic
conditions
were
investigated
.

SDS-PAGE
analysis
of
the
AAPH-treated
proteins
revealed
the
occurrence
of
protein
aggregation
,
cross-linking
,
and
fragmentation;
BLP
,
which
are
naturally
organized
in
globular
assemblies
,
were
the
most
affected
proteins
.

Transmission
electron
microscopy
(
TEM
)
analysis
of
BLP
shows
the
formation
of
complex
protein
aggregates
after
treatment
with
AAPH
.

These
structural
modifications
were
accompanied
by
the
formation
of
protein
carbonyl
groups
and
protein
hydroperoxides
.

The
yield
of
carbonyls
was
lower
than
that
for
protein
hydroperoxide
generation
and
was
unrelated
to
protein
fragmentation
.

The
oxidized
proteins
were
also
characterized
by
significant
oxidation
of
Met
,
Trp
,
and
Tyr
(
but
not
other
)
residues
,
and
low
levels
of
dityrosine
.

As
the
dityrosine
yield
is
too
low
to
account
for
the
observed
cross-linking
,
we
propose
that
aggregation
is
associated
with
tryptophan
oxidation
and
Trp-derived
cross-links
.

It
is
also
proposed
that
Trp
oxidation
products
play
a
fundamental
role
in
nonrandom
fragmentation
and
carbonyl
group
formation
particularly
for
LYSO

The
aim

to
evaluate

analyzed
in

TCDD
administration
(
10
ng

)
decreased
the

It
did
not
affect

increased

In

These

show
that

in
the

MicroRNAs
(
miRs

play
important
roles
in
initiation

progression
of
many
pathologic
processes
.

However
,
the
roles
of
miRs
in
diabetic
nephropathy
remain
unclear
.

This
study
was
to
determine
whether
miR-21
was
involved
in
diabetic
nephropathy
and
to
explore
the
relationship
between
miR-21
and
MMP9
/
TIMP1
expression
in
diabetic
nephropathy
.

In

hybridization
studies
showed
that
miR-21
was
primarily
localized
and
distributed
in
cortical
glomerular
and
renal
tubular
cells
in
diabetic

kidney
.

Real-time
quantitative
RT-PCR
demonstrated
that
the
expression
of
miR-21
was
significantly
increased
in
kk-ay
mice
,
compared
with
control
C57BL

.

Interestingly
,
miR-21
expression
positively
correlated
with

while
negatively
correlated
with

Importantly

antagomir-21
not
only
ameliorated

but
also
decreased

In
conclusion
,
our
data
demonstrate
that
miR-21
contributes
to

that

Cinobufagin

a

,
is
an
important
cardenolidal
steroid
.

Several
studies
have
suggested
that
cinobufagin
has
potent
anti-cancer
effects
.

The
present
study
examines
the
apoptosis-inducing
activity
and
the
underlying
mechanism
of
action
of
cinobufagin
in
osteosarcoma
(
OS
)
cells
.

Our
results
showed
that
cinobufagin
potently
inhibited
the
proliferation
of
U2OS
,
MG63
and
SaOS-2
cells
.

Significant
increases
in
G2
/
M
cell-cycle
arrest
and
apoptosis
in
OS
cells
were
also
observed
.

The
expression
levels
of
several
apoptotic
proteins
were
assessed
after
cinobufagin
treatment
in
U2OS
cells
.

Among
them
,
xIAP
,
cIAP-1
,
survivin
and
Bcl-2
levels
decreased
remarkably
,
while
the
levels
of
Bax
and
cleaved-PARP
increased
.

Furthermore
,
we
validated
the
inhibition
of
GSK-3β
/
NF-κB
signaling
following
cinobufagin
treatment
.

Western
blots
showed
a
decrease
in
nuclear
p65
protein
expression
after
exposure
to
different
concentrations
of
cinobufagin
,
while
the
phosphorylation
of
GSK-3β
was
simultaneously
increased
.

Transduction
with
constitutively
active
forms
of
GSK-3β
could
protect
against
the
downregulation
of
p65
and
upregulation
of
cleaved-PARP
that
are
induced
by
cinobufagin
treatment
.

However
,
combined
treatment
with
cinobufagin
and
SB216367
resulted
in
a
significant
reduction
in
p65
and
an
increase
in
cleaved-PARP
in
U2OS
cells
.

Altogether
,
these
results
show
that
cinobufagin
is
a
promising
agent
for
the
treatment
of
OS
.

These
studies
are
the
first
to
reveal
the
involvement
of
the
GSK-3β
/
NF-κB
pathway
in
cinobufagin-induced
apoptosis

This
review
focuses
on
the
mechanisms
regulating
the
synthesis
,
secretion
,
biological
actions
,
and
therapeutic
relevance
of
the
incretin
peptides
glucose-dependent
insulinotropic
polypeptide
(
GIP
)
and
glucagon-like
peptide-1
(
GLP-1
)
.

The
published
literature
was
reviewed
,
with
emphasis
on
recent
advances
in
our
understanding
of
the
biology
of
GIP
and
GLP-1
.

GIP
and
GLP-1
are
both
secreted
within
minutes
of
nutrient
ingestion
and
facilitate
the
rapid
disposal
of
ingested
nutrients
.

Both
peptides
share
common
actions
on
islet
beta-cells
acting
through
structurally
distinct
yet
related
receptors
.

Incretin-receptor
activation
leads
to
glucose-dependent
insulin
secretion
,
induction
of
beta-cell
proliferation
,
and
enhanced
resistance
to
apoptosis
.

GIP
also
promotes
energy
storage
via
direct
actions
on
adipose
tissue
,
and
enhances
bone
formation
via
stimulation
of
osteoblast
proliferation
and
inhibition
of
apoptosis
.

In
contrast
,
GLP-1
exerts
glucoregulatory
actions
via
slowing
of
gastric
emptying
and
glucose-dependent
inhibition
of
glucagon
secretion
.

GLP-1
also
promotes
satiety
and
sustained
GLP-1-receptor
activation
is
associated
with
weight
loss
in
both
preclinical
and
clinical
studies
.

The
rapid
degradation
of
both
GIP
and
GLP-1
by
the
enzyme
dipeptidyl
peptidase-4
has
led
to
the
development
of
degradation-resistant
GLP-1-receptor
agonists
and
dipeptidyl
peptidase-4
inhibitors
for
the
treatment
of
type
2
diabetes
.

These
agents
decrease
hemoglobin
A1c
(
HbA1c
)
safely
without
weight
gain
in
subjects

type
2

GLP-1
and

nutrient-derived
signals

food
intake
,

absorption
,
and

Nomifensine
is
an
antidepressant
agent
that
was
removed
from
use
because
of
a
high
incidence
of
hemolytic
anemia
.

It
contains
an
N-methyl-8-aminotetrahydroisoquinoline
ring
which
has
the
potential
to
be
oxidized
to
quaternary
dihydroisoquinolinium
and
isoquinolinium
ions
,
albeit
such
a
transformation
had
not
been
previously
observed
.

In
this
report
,
we
demonstrate
the
conversion
of
nomifensine
to
a
dihydroisoquinolinium
ion
metabolite
by
several
human
enzymes
.

Human
liver
microsomes
supplemented
with
NADPH
generated
the
dihydroisoquinolinium
ion
metabolite
along
with
other
hydroxylated
metabolites
,
whereas
when
supplemented
with
t-butyl
peroxide
,
only
the
dihydroisoquinolinium
ion
metabolite
was
observed
.

Monoamine

,
but
not
monoamine
oxidase
B
,
catalyzed
this
reaction
,
as

as
human
hemoglobin
supplemented
with
H2O2
.

Human
myeloperoxidase
catalyzed
this
reaction
in
the
presence
of
H2O2
,
and
activation
of
the
reaction
was
observed
when
incubations
were
conducted
in
the
presence
of
acetaminophen
at
concentrations
relevant
to
those
measured
in
humans
.

The
reaction
was
also
observed
in
human
whole
blood
.

The
equilibrium
between
the
dihydroisoquinolinium
ion
and
carbinolamine
was
shown
to
have
a
pK
of
about
11
.
7
.

The
dihydroisoquinolinium
ion
was
shown
to
react
with
cyanide
and
borohydride
,
but
not
glutathione
.

These
findings
suggest
that
the
electrophilic
nomifensine
dihydroisoquinolinium
metabolite
,
which
can
be
generated
by
several
enzymes
,
could
be
behind
toxic
responses
to
nomifensine
such
as
hemolytic
anemia
and
hepatotoxicity
.

The
potential
interaction
of
acetylcholinesterase
inhibitors
with
cholinergic
receptors
may
play
a
significant
role
in
the
therapeutic
and
/
or
side-effects
associated
with
this
class
of
compound
.

In
the
present
study
,
the
capacity
of
acetylcholinesterase
inhibitors
to
interact
with
muscarinic
receptors
was
assessed
by
their
ability
to
displace
both
[
3H
]
-oxotremorine-M
and
[
3H
]
-quinuclinidyl
benzilate
binding
in
rat
brain
membranes
.

The
[
3H
]
-quinuclinidyl
benzilate
/
[
3H
]
-oxotremorine-M
affinity
ratios
permitted
predictions
to
be
made
of
either
the
antagonist
or
agonist
properties
of
the
different
compounds
.

A
series
of
compounds
,
representative
of
the
principal
classes
of
acetylcholinesterase
inhibitors
,
displaced
[
3H
]
-oxotremorine-M
binding
with
high-to-moderate
potency
(
ambenonium>neostigmine
=
pyridostigmine
=
tacrine>physostigmine>
edrophonium
=
galanthamine>desoxypeganine
)
whereas
only
ambenonium
and
tacrine
displaced
[
3H
]
-quinuclinidyl
benzilate
binding
.

Inhibitors
such
as
desoxypeganine
,
parathion
and
gramine
demonstrated
negligible
inhibition
of
the
binding
of
both
radioligands
.

Scatchard
plots
constructed
from
the
inhibition
of
[
3H
]
-oxotremorine-M
binding
in
the
absence
and
presence
of
different
inhibitors
showed
an
unaltered
Bmax
and
a
reduced
affinity
constant
,
indicative
of
potential
competitive
or
allosteric
mechanisms
.

The
capacity
of
acetylcholinesterase
inhibitors
,
with
the
exception
of
tacrine
and
ambenonium
,
to
displace
bound
[
3H
]
-oxotremorine-M
in
preference
to
[
3H
]
quinuclinidyl
benzilate
predicts
that
the
former
compounds
could
act
as
potential
agonists
at
muscarinic
receptors
.

Moreover
,
the
rank
order
for
potency
in
inhibiting
acetylcholinesterase
(
ambenonium>neostigmine
=
physostigmine
=
tacrine>pyridostigmine
=
edrophonium
=
galanthamine
>desoxypeganine>parathion>gramine
)
indicated
that
the
most
effective
inhibitors
of
acetylcholinesterase
also
displaced
[
3H
]
-oxotremorine-M
to
the
greatest
extent
.

The
capacity
of
these
inhibitors
to
displace
[
3H
]
-oxotremorine-M
binding
preclude
their
utilisation
for
the
prevention
of
acetylcholine
catabolism
in
rat
brain
membranes
,
the
latter
being
required
to
estimate
the
binding
of
acetylcholine
to
[
3H
]
-oxotremorine-M-labelled
muscarinic
receptors
.

However
,
fasciculin-2
,
a
potent
peptide
inhibitor
of
acetylcholinesterase
(
IC50
24
nM
)
,
did
prevent
catabolism
of
acetylcholine
in
rat
brain
membranes
with
an
atypical
inhibition
isotherm
of
[
3H
]
-oxotremorine-M
binding
,
thus
permitting
an
estimation
of
the
"global
affinity"
of
acetylcholine
(
Ki
85
nM
)
for
[
3H
]
-oxotremorine-M-labelled
muscarinic

An

functionally
related
polymorphisms

brain
tumors
.
PURPOSE
:
Beta-2
adrenoceptor
antagonists
such
as
timolol
have
been
used
in
the
treatment
of
glaucoma
for
more
than
30
years
.

Several
functionally
important
polymorphisms
for
the
beta-2
receptor
have
been
described
.

In
the
present
study
we
hypothesized
that
a
relation
between
the
intraocular
pressure
(
IOP
)
lowering
effect
of
timolol
and
beta-2
adrenoceptor
polymorphisms
may
exist
.

METHODS
:
A
total
of
270
healthy
nonsmoking
subjects
were
screened
and
individuals
homozygous
for
the
wild
beta-2
Adrenoceptor
(
Arg16
/
Gln27
)
and
two
polymorphisms
(
Gly16
/
Gln27
or
Gly16
/
Glu27
)
were
included
.

In
these
subjects
the
IOP
lowering
effect
of
timolol
was
compared
.

RESULTS
:
Twenty-four
subjects
were
included
in
the
group
Arg16
/
Gln27
,
18
subjects
in
the
group
Gly16
/
Gln27
,
and
47
subjects
in
the
group
Gly16
/
Glu27
.

The
ocular
hypotensive
effect
of
timolol
was
between
40
and
45%
in
all
groups
,
but
not
significantly
different
between
the
three
study
groups
(
p
=
0
.
979
)
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
The
present
study
indicates
that
the
beta-2
adrenoceptor
polymorphism
does
not
influence
the
ocular
hypotensive
effects
of
topical
beta
adrenoceptor
antagonists
.

Accordingly
,
other
factors
appear
to
be
responsible
for
the
intersubject
variability
seen
with
timolol
in
glaucoma
subjects
.

RESULTS
:
Compared
with

was
remarkably
increased
in

Zolmitriptan
is
a
new
serotonergic
agonist
with
excellent
oral
bioavailability
exhibiting
a
potent
symptomatic
antimigraine
effect
.

Zolmitriptan
is
a
selective
agonist
of
5-HT1B
/
D
receptors
.

5-HT1B
receptors
are
concentrated
in
the
wall
of
the
cranial
extracerebral
arteries
.

5-HT1D
receptors
are
located
on
the
trigeminal
terminals
which
receive
pain
from
the
leptomeningeal
vessels
.

Migraine
pain
has
its
origin
on
cranial
vessels
.

In
fact
,
during
a
migraine
attack
the
trigeminovascular
system
,
which
is
composed
by
the
cranial
vessels
and
its
trigeminal
terminals
,
is
activated
.

The
activation
of
this
system
induces
both
dilatation
and
aseptic
inflammation
of
cranial
vessels
.

Zolmitriptan
blocks
both
vascular
phenomena
.

Its
agonist
action
upon
the
5-HT1D
receptor
ends
the
aseptic
inflammation
by
inhibiting
the
release
of
vasoactive
peptides
.

The
dilatation
of
meningeal
vessels
disappears
due
to
the
stimulation
of
zolmitriptan
of
5-HT1B
receptors
.

As
this
drug
crosses
the
blood
brain
barrier
,
zolmitriptan
has
both
peripheral
and
central
actions
over
the
espinal
trigeminal
nucleus
,
which
is
rich
in
5-HT1B
/
D
receptors
.

Thus
,
the
mechanism
of
action
of
zolmitriptan
is
double
.

On
the
one
hand
,
zolmitriptan
acts
peripherally
inhibiting
dilatation
and
inflammation
of
cranial
vessels
.

On
the
other
,
zolmitriptan
exhibits
a
central
nociceptive
action
in
the
brainstem
nuclei
.

This
dual
action
of
zolmitriptan
on
migraine
pain
is
completed
with
its
beneficial
effects
on
nausea
and
vomiting
,
due
to
its
binding
to
the
nucleus
of
the
tractus
solitarius
,
the
center
for
control
of
vomiting
.

Local
delivery
of
growth
factors
(
GFs
)
can
accelerate
regeneration
of
injured
tissue
,
but
for
many
medical
applications
,
injectable
GF
delivery
systems
are
required
for
clinical
success
.

Viscoelastic
,
injectable
aggregates
of
micrometer-sized
hydrogel
particles
made
of
multiarmed
polyethylene
glycol
(
starPEG
)
and
heparin
were
prepared
and
tested
for
site-specific
paracrine
stimulation
of
tissue
regeneration
.

Heparin
was
used
as
it
binds
,
protects
and
releases
numerous
GFs
.

Hydrogel
based
delivery
of
basic
fibroblast
growth
factor
(
bFGF
)
and
murine
epidermal
growth
factor
(
EGF
)
was
monitored
utilizing
enzyme-linked
immunosorbent
assay
(
ELISA
)
.

bFGF
was
released
slowly
because
of
its
high
affinity
to
the
heparin
while
the
significantly
higher
release
of
the
non-specific
binding
EGF
was
controlled
by
diffusion
only
.

To
investigate
GF
delivery
in
vivo
,
a
hydrogel
loaded
with
murine
EGF
or
bFGF
was
injected
subcapsularly
into
the
left
kidney
of
mice
with
experimental
acute
kidney
injury
caused
by
glycerol
induced
rhabdomyolysis
.

Visual
examination
confirmed
sustained
stability
of
the
injected
gel
aggregates
during
the
timescale
of
the
experiment
.

The
number
of
proliferating
kidney
tubular
epithelial
cells
was
quantified
both
in
the
injected
kidney
and
the
non-injected
contralateral
kidney
.

bFGF
delivery
from
hydrogels
induced
a
significant
increase
in
cell
proliferation
in
the
injected
kidney
,
although
small
effects
were
also
seen
in
the
non-injected
kidney
due
to
a
systemic
effect
.

EGF
delivery
strongly
increased
cell
proliferation
for
both
kidneys
,
but
also
showed
a
local
effect
on
the
injected
kidney
.

The
hydrogel
without
loaded
GFs
was
used
as
a
control
and
showed
no
increase
in
cell
proliferation
.

Our
results
suggest
that
this
novel
starPEG-heparin
hydrogel
system
can
be
an
effective
approach
to
deliver
GFs
locally
.

The
present
study
analyses
the
short-
(
15
min
-
2
h
)
and
long-term
(
24
-
48
h
)
influences
of
calcitonin
gene-related
peptide
(
CGRP
)
on
acetylcholinesterase
(
AChE
)
expression
in
the
rat
cultured
skeletal
muscle
and
the
signal
transduction
events
underlying
CGRP
actions
.

To
assess
the
effect
of
CGRP
on
AChE
synthesis
,
myotubes
were
pre-exposed
to
the
irreversible
AChE
inhibitor
diisopropyl
fluorophosphate
(
DFP
)
and
treated
with
CGRP
or
forskolin
,
an
adenylyl
cyclase
(
AC
)
activator
.

Treatment
of
myotubes
with
1
-
100
nM
CGRP
for
2
h
increased
by
up
to
42%
the
synthesis
of
catalytically
active
AChE
with
a
parallel
increase
in
the
intracellular
cyclic
AMP
.

The
stimulation
of
AChE
synthesis
induced
by
CGRP
was
mimicked
by
direct
activation
of
AC
with
3
-
30
microM
forskolin
.

In
contrast
,
pre-treatment
of
cultures
with
100
nM
CGRP
for
20
h
reduced
by
37%
the
subsequent
synthesis
of
AChE
,
resulting
in
a
15%
decrease
in
total
AChE
activity
after
48
h
CGRP
treatment
.

Moreover
,
24
h
treatment
of
myotubes
with
100
nM
CGRP
reduced
by
54%
the
accumulation
of
cyclic
AMP
induced
by
a
subsequent
CGRP
treatment
.

These
findings
indicate
that
,
in
skeletal
muscle
cells
,
CGRP
modulates
the
AChE
expression
in
a
time-dependent
manner
,
initially
stimulating
the
enzyme
synthesis
through
a
cyclic
AMP-dependent
mechanism
.

The
decreased
AChE
synthesis
observed
after
long-term
CGRP
treatment
suggests
that
CGRP
signalling
system
is
subject
to
desensitization
or
down-regulation
,
that
might
function
as
an
important
adaptative
mechanism
of
the
muscle
fibre
in
response
to
long-term
changes
in
neuromuscular
transmission
.
Acetylcholinesterase
(
AChE
)
predominates
in
the
healthy
brain
,
with
butyrylcholinesterase
(
BuChE
)
considered
to
play
a
minor
role
in
regulating
brain
acetylcholine
(
ACh
)
levels
.

However
,
BuChE
activity
progressively
increases
in
patients
with
Alzheimer's
disease
(
AD
)
,
while
AChE
activity
remains
unchanged
or
declines
.

Both
enzymes
therefore
represent
legitimate
therapeutic
targets
for
ameliorating
the
cholinergic
deficit
considered
to
be
responsible
for
the
declines
in
cognitive
,
behavioral
and
global
functioning
characteristic
of
AD
.

The
two
enzymes
differ
in
substrate
specificity
,
kinetics
and
activity
in
different
brain
regions
.

Experimental
evidence
from
the
use
of
agents
with
enhanced
selectivity
for
BuChE
(
cymserine
analogues
,
MF-8622
)
and
the
dual
inhibitor
of
both
AChE
and
BuChE
,
rivastigmine
,
indicates
potential
therapeutic
benefits
of
inhibiting
both
AChE
and
BuChE
in
AD
and
related
dementias
.

Recent
evidence
suggests
that
both
AChE
and
BuChE
may
have
roles
in
the
aetiology
and
progression
of
AD
beyond
regulation
of
synaptic
ACh
levels
.

The
development
of
specific
BuChE
inhibitors
and
further
experience
with
the
dual
enzyme
inhibitor
rivastigmine
will
improve
understanding
of
the
aetiology
of
AD
and
should
lead
to
a
wider
variety
of
potent
treatment
options
.
The
C2
domain
of
PKCalpha
is
a
Ca
(
2
+
)
-dependent
membrane-targeting
module
involved
in
the
plasma
membrane
localization
of
the
enzyme
.

Recent
findings
have
shown
an
additional
area
located
in
the
beta3-beta4
strands
,
named
the
lysine-rich
cluster
,
which
has
been
demonstrated
to
be
involved
in
the
PtdIns
(
4
,
5
)
P
(
2
)
-dependent
activation
of
the
enzyme
.

Nevertheless
,
whether
other
anionic
phospholipids
can
bind
to
this
region
and
contribute
to
the
regulation
of
the
enzyme's
function
is
not
clear
.

To
study
other
possible
roles
for
this
cluster
,
we
generated
double
and
triple
mutants
that
substituted
the
lysine
by
alanine
residues
,
and
studied
their
binding
and
activation
properties
in
a
Ca
(
2
+
)
/
phosphatidylserine-dependent
manner
and
compared
them
with
the
wild-type
protein
.

It
was
found
that
some
of
the
mutants
exerted
a
constitutive
activation
independently
of
membrane
binding
.

Furthermore
,
the
constructs
were
fused
to
green
fluorescent
protein
and
were
expressed
in
fibroblast
cells
.

It
was
shown
that
none
of
the
mutants
was
able
to
translocate
to
the
plasma
membrane
,
even
in
saturating
conditions
of
Ca
(
2
+
)
and
diacylglycerol
,
suggesting
that
the
interactions
performed
by
this
lysine-rich
cluster
are
a
key
event
in
the
subcellular
localization
of
PKCalpha
.

Taken
together
,
the
results
obtained
showed
that
these
lysine
residues
might
be
involved
in
two
functions
:
one
to
establish
an
intramolecular
interaction
that
keeps
the
enzyme
in
an
inactive
conformation;
and
the
second
,
once
the
enzyme
has
been
partially
activated
,
to
establish
further
interactions
with
diacylglycerol
and
/
or
acidic
phospholipids
,
leading
to
the
full
activation
of
PKCalpha
.

Ganodermanondiol
,
a
biologically
active
compound
,
was
isolated
from
the
Lingzhi
mushroom
(
Ganoderma
lucidum
)
.

The
present
study
examined
the
protective
effects
of
ganodermanondiol
against
tert-butyl
hydroperoxide
(
t-BHP
)
-induced
hepatotoxicity
.

Ganodermanondiol
protected
human
liver-derived
HepG2
cells
through
nuclear
factor-E2-related
factor
2
(
Nrf2
)
pathway-dependent
heme
oxygenase-1
expressions
.

Moreover
,
ganodermanondiol
increased
cellular
glutathione
levels
and
the
expression
of
the
glutamine-cysteine
ligase
gene
in
a
dose-dependent
manner
.

Furthermore
,
ganodermanondiol
exposure
enhanced
the
phosphorylation
of
adenosine
monophosphate-activated
protein
kinase
(
AMPK
)
and
its
upstream
kinase
activators
,
LKB1
and
Ca
(
2
+
)
/
calmodulin-dependent
protein
kinase-II
(
CaMKII
)
.

This
study
indicates
that
ganodermanondiol
exhibits
potent
cytoprotective
effects
on
t-BHP-induced
hepatotoxicity
in
human
liver-derived
HepG2
cells
,
presumably
through
Nrf2-mediated
antioxidant
enzymes
and
AMPK
.
H2O2
generation
is
a
limiting
step
in
thyroid
hormone
biosynthesis
.

Biochemical
studies
have
confirmed
that
H2O2
is
generated
by
a
thyroid
Ca2
+
/
NADPH-dependent
oxidase
.

Decreased
H2O2
availability
may
be
another
mechanism
of
inhibition
of
thyroperoxidase
activity
produced
by
thioureylene
compounds
,
as
propylthiouracil
(
PTU
)
and
methimazole
(
MMI
)
are
antioxidant
agents
.

Therefore
,
we
analyzed
whether
PTU
or
MMI
could
scavenge
H2O2
or
inhibit
thyroid
NADPH
oxidase
activity
in
vitro
.

Our
results
show
that
PTU
and
thiourea
did
not
significantly
scavenge
H2O2
.

However
,
MMI
significantly
scavenged
H2O2
at
high
concentrations
.

Only
MMI
was
able
to
decrease
the
amount
of
H2O2
generated
by
the
glucose-glucose
oxidase
system
.

On
the
other
hand
,
both
PTU
and
MMI
were
able
to
partially
inhibit
thyroid
NADPH
oxidase
activity
in
vitro
.

As
PTU
did
not
scavenge
H2O2
under
the
conditions
used
here
,
we
presume
that
this
drug
may
directly
inhibit
thyroid
NADPH
oxidase
.

Also
,
at
the
concentration
necessary
to
inhibit
NADPH
oxidase
activity
,
MMI
did
not
scavenge
H2O2
,
also
suggesting
a
direct
effect
of
MMI
on
thyroid
NADPH
oxidase
.

In
conclusion
,
this
study
shows
that
MMI
,
but
not
PTU
,
is
able
to
scavenge
H2O2
in
the
micromolar
range
and
that
both
PTU
and
MMI
can
impair
thyroid
H2O2
generation
in
addition
to
their
potent
thyroperoxidase
inhibitory
effects
.

Based
on
our

,
we
have
synthesized
a
series
of
aryl
sulfonamides
that
inhibit
the
CXCR4
/
CXCL12
interaction
.

Analogue
bioactivities
were
assessed
with
binding

assays
.

Computer
modeling
was
employed
to
evaluate
a
selection
of
the
new

docked
into
the
CXCR4

structure
and
to
rationalize
discrepancies
between

These

Yet
the
neurobehavioral
toxicity
due
to
occupational
exposure
to
vanadium
remained
elusive
.

This
cross-sectional
study
was
designed
to
examine
the
neurotoxic
effects
of
occupational
vanadium
exposure
.

A
total
of
463
vanadium-exposed
workers
(
exposed
group
)
and
251
non-exposed
workers
(
control
group
)
were
recruited
from
a
Steel
and
Iron
Group
in
Sichuan
,
China
.

A
WHO-recommended
neurobehavioral
core
test
battery
(
NCTB
)
and
event-related
auditory
evoked
potentials
test
(
P300
)
were
used
to
assess
the
neurobehavioral
functions
of
all
study
subjects
.

A
general
linear
model
was
used
to
compare
outcome
scores
between
the
two
groups
while
controlling
for
possible
confounders
.

The
exposed
group
showed
a
statistically
significant
neurobehavioral
alteration
more
than
the
control
group
in
the
NCTB
tests
.

The
exposed
workers
also
exhibited
an
increased
anger-hostility
,
depression-dejection
and
fatigue-inertia
on
the
profile
of
mood
states
(
p<0
.

)
.

Performances
in
the
simple

time
,
digit

,
benton
visual

and
pursuit
aiming
were
also
poorer
among
exposed
workers
as
compared
to
unexposed
control
workers
(
p<0
.
05
)
.

Some
of
these
poor
performances
in
tests
were
also
significantly
related
to
workers'
exposure
duration
.

P300
latencies
were
longer
in
the
exposed
group
than
in
the
control
(
p<0

.

Longer
mean
reaction
times
and
more
counting
errors
were
also
found
in
the
exposed
workers
(

)
.

Given
the
findings
of
our
study
and
the
limitations
of
neurobehavioral
workplace
testing
,
we
found
evidence
of
altered
neurobehavioral
outcomes
by

To

cells
were

Cultured

also
exhibited

Thus
cultured

maintain

The
stimulatory

was
blocked
by

,
a

.

To
determine
whether
metaproterenol-dependent
increases
in
Na-K-ATPase
were
dependent
on
apical
sodium
entry
,
apical
entry
was
blocked
with
dimethylamiloride
or
maximized
with
monensin
.

Both
dimethylamiloride
and
monensin
prevented
metaproterenol
activation
of
Na-K-ATPase
.

Metaproterenol-mediated
increases
in
Na-K-ATPase

In

In

we
have
shown
that

the
intracellularly
applied
GDP
analog
guanosine
5'-O-
(
2-thiodiphosphate
)
and
by
pretreatment
of
cells
with
pertussis
toxin
.

In
contrast
to
adrenaline
and
somatostatin
,
galanin
,
another
inhibitor
of
insulin
secretion
,
reduced
Ca2
+
currents
by
about
40%
in
a
pertussis
toxin-insensitive
manner
.

Immunoblot
experiments
performed
with
antibodies
generated
against
synthetic
peptides
revealed
that
membranes
of
RINm5F
cells
possess
four
pertussis
toxin-sensitive
G-proteins
including
Gi1
,
Gi2
,
Go2
,
and
another
Go
subtype
,
most
likely
representing
Go1
.

In
membranes
of
control
but
not
of
pertussis
toxin-treated
cells
,
adrenaline
via
alpha
2-adrenoceptors
stimulated
incorporation
of
the
photo-reactive

analog
[

]
GTP
azidoanilide
into
pertussis
toxin
substrates
comigrating
with
the
alpha-subunits
of
Gi2
,
Go2
,
and
the
not
further
identified
Go
subtype
.

The
present
findings
indicate
that
activated
alpha
2-adrenoceptors
of
RINm5F
cells
interact
with
multiple
G-proteins
,
i
.

e
.

two
forms
of
Go
and
with
Gi2
.

These
G-proteins
are
likely
to
be
involved
in
the
adrenaline-induced
inhibition
of
dihydropyridine-sensitive
Ca2
+
currents
and
in
other
signal
transduction
pathways
contributing
to
the
adrenaline-induced
inhibition
of
insulin
secretion
.
The
effect
of
P-glycoprotein
(
P-gp
,
ABCB1
,
MDR1
)
expression
on
cell
resistance
to
nilotinib
was
studied
in
human
leukaemia
cells
.

We
used
K562
/
Dox
cells
overexpressing
P-gp
and
their
variants
(
subclones
)
with
a
gradually
decreased
P-gp
expression
.

These
subclones
were
established
by
stable
transfection
of
K562
/
Dox
cells
with
a
plasmid
vector
expressing
shRNA
targeting
the
ABCB1
gene
.

Functional
analysis
of
P-gp
using
a
specific
fluorescent
probe
indicated
gradually
decreased
dye
efflux
which
was
proportional
to
the
P-gp
expression
.

We
observed
that
K562
/
Dox
cells
overexpressing
P-gp
contained
a
significantly
reduced
intracellular
level
of
nilotinib
when
compared
to
their
counter
partner
K562
cells
,
which
do
not
express
P-gp
.

This
effect
was
accompanied
by
a
decreased
sensitivity
of
the
K562
/
Dox
cells
to
nilotinib
.

Importantly
,
cells
with
downregulated
expression
of
P-gp
gradually
lost
their
ability
to
decrease
the
intracellular
level
of
nilotinib
although
they
still
significantly
decreased
the
intracellular
level
of
daunorubicin
(
DNR
)
.

Accordingly
,
cells
with
the
reduced
expression
of
P-gp
concomitantly
failed
to
provide
resistance
to
nilotinib
,
however
,
they
exhibited
a
significant
resistance
to
DNR
.

Taken
together
,
we
demonstrated
that
the
conclusion
as
to
whether
P-gp
is
involved
in
nilotinib
resistance
or
not
strongly
depends
on
its
expression
at
protein
level
.

The
in

antioxidant
and
antifibrotic
properties
of
green
tea
(
Camellia

,
Theaceae
)
were
investigated
with
a
study
of
carbon
tetrachloride
(
CCl
(

)
)
-induced
oxidative
stress
and
hepatic
fibrosis
in
male
ICR
mice
.

Oral
administration
of
green
tea
extract
at
doses
of
125
,
625
and
1250
mg
/
kg
for
8
weeks
significantly
reduced
(
p<0

)
the
levels
of
thiobarbituric
acid-reactive
substances
(
TBARS
)
and
protein
carbonyls
in
the
liver
by
at
least
28%
compared
with
that
was
induced
by
CCl
(
4
)
(
1
mL
/
kg
)
in
mice
.

Moreover
,
green
tea
extract
administration
significantly
increased
(
p<0
.
05
)
the
activities
of
catalase
,
glutathione
peroxidase
(
GSH-Px
)
and
glutathione
reductase
(
GSH-Rd
)
in
the
liver
.

Our
study
found
that
oral
administration
of
green
tea
extract
prevented
CCl
(
4
)
-induced
hepatic
fibrosis
,
as
evidenced
by
a
decreased
hydroxyproline
level
in
the
liver
and
a
reduced
incidence
of
hepatic
fibrosis
by
histological
observations
.

These
results
indicate
that
green
tea
exhibits
potent
protective
effects
against
CCl
(
4
)
-induced
oxidative
stress
and
hepatic
fibrosis
in
mice
by
inhibiting
oxidative
damage
and
increasing

antipsychotics
.
PURPOSE
:
Resistance
to
topoisomerase
(
TOP
)
1
and
2
inhibitors
is
a
potentially
important
reason
for
treatment
failure
,
and
may
be
related
,
in
part
,
to
a
down-regulation
of
the
specific
TOP
target
.

Investigators
in
our
laboratories
previously
noted
such
a
down-regulation
of
the
target
,
along
with
a
reciprocal
up-regulation
of
the
alternate
TOP
.

Therefore
,
sequencing
TOP
inhibitors
may
provide
a
means
for
overcoming
resistance
to
the
TOP
I
and
II
inhibitors
.

Furthermore
,
point
mutations
in
TOP
I
,
which
confer
resistance
to
TOP
I
inhibitors
,
were
associated
with
collateral
sensitivity
to
cisplatin
.

EXPERIMENTAL
DESIGN
:

and
cisplatin
(
20-25

(

)
/
day
)
on
days
8
to
10
.

The
timing
of
the
drug
sequence
was
based
on
the
prior
Phase
I
pharmacokinetic
and
pharmacodynamic
studies
of
camptothecin
and
etoposide
,
and
the
level
of
the
TOP
targets
in

monocytes
.

RESULTS
:
Fifteen
patients
(
7
males
and
8

)
received
40
courses
of

.

The

)
,
and
the
median

was

.

The
diagnoses
included
:

Three

and
a

was
then
made
to

rather
than
additionally
reduce
the

were
then
treated
on

,
and
1
of
the
8
patients
experienced
a

.

Thus
,
cohort
level

was
considered
the
recommended

.

Twelve
of

Serotonin
(
5-HT
)
is
considered
as
a
major
mediator
causing
hyperalgesia
and
is
involved
in
inflammatory

and
irritable

syndrome
.

Alverine
citrate
may
possess
visceral
antinociceptive
properties
in
a
rat
model
of
rectal
distension-induced
abdominal
contractions
.

This
study
was
designed
to
evaluate
the
pharmacological
properties
of
alverine
citrate
in
a
rat
model
of
rectal
hyperalgesia
induced
by
5-HTP
(
5-HT
precursor
)
and
by
a
selective
5-HT1A
agonist
(
8-OH-DPAT
)
and
to
compare
this
activity
with
a
reference
5-HT1A
antagonist
(
WAY
100635
)
.

At
4
h
after
their
administration
,
5-HTP
and
8-OH-DPAT
increased
the
number
of
abdominal
contractions
in
response
to
rectal
distension
at
the
lowest
volume
of
distension
(
0
.
4
mL
)
.

When
injected
intraperitoneally
before
8-OH-DPAT
and
5-HTP
,
WAY
100635
(
1
mg
kg
(
-1
)
)
blocked
their
nociceptive
effect
,
but
also
reduced
the
response
to
the
highest
volume
of
distension
(
1
.
6
mL
)
.

Similarly
,
when
injected
intraperitoneally
,
alverine
citrate
(
20
mg
kg
(
-1
)
)
suppressed
the
effect
of
5-HTP
,
but
not
that
of
8-OH-DPAT
.

However
,
when
injected
intracerebroventricularly
(
75
microg
/
rat
)
alverine
citrate
reduced
8-OH-DPAT-induced
enhancement
of
rectal
distension-induced
abdominal
contractions
.

In-vitro
binding
studies
revealed
that
alverine
citrate
had
a
high
affinity
for
5-HT1A
receptors
and
a
weak
affinity
for
5-HT3
and
5-HT4
subtypes
.

These
results
suggest
that
5-HTP-induced
rectal
hypersensitivity
involves
5-TH1A
receptors
and
that
alverine
citrate
acts
as
a
selective
antagonist
at
the
5-HT1A
receptor
subtype
to
block
both
5-HTP
and
8-OH-DPAT-induced
rectal
hypersensitivity
.
The
binding
of
the
antipsychotic
drugs
risperidone
,
(
+
)
-butaclamol
,
clozapine
,
haloperidol
,
spiperone
,
thioridazine
and
YM-09151-2
was
studied
at
the
subtypes
of
the
alpha
1-adrenoceptor
.

Saturation
experiments
showed
that
[
3H
]
prazosin
labelled
a
single
population
of
binding
sites
in
the
spleen
(
alpha
1B
)
and
hippocampus
(
alpha
1A
and
alpha
1B
)
(
dissociation
constants
(
KD
)
:
0
.
26
nM
and
0

14
nM
respectively
)
.

Prazosin
displaced
the
radioligand
in
a
monophasic
manner
in
both
the
spleen
and
hippocampus
whereas
5-methyl-urapidil
,
phentolamine
and
WB
4101
displaced
the
radioligand
in
a
monophasic
manner
in
the
spleen
but
in
a
biphasic
manner
in
the
hippocampus
.

The
affinity
of
these
three
compounds
for
the
low
affinity
site
in
the
hippocampus
was
similar
to
that
observed
in
the
spleen
,
suggesting
that
all
three
were
selective
for
the
alpha
1A-adrenoceptor
.

Furthermore
,
the
affinities
for
the
alpha
1A-
and
alpha
1B-adrenoceptors
calculated
in
this
manner
were
in
agreement
with
literature
values
.

With
the
exception
of
risperidone
,
all
the
antipsychotic
drugs
tested
failed
to
show
selectivity
for
either
of
the
alpha
1-adrenoceptor
subtypes
.

Risperidone
was
120-fold
more
selective
for
the
alpha
1B-adrenoceptor
with
respect
to
the
alpha
1A-adrenoceptor

Regucalcin
(
RGN
/
SMP30
)
was
originally
discovered
in
1978
as
a
unique
calcium-binding
protein
that
does
not
contain
the
EF-hand
motif
of
calcium-binding
domain
.

The
regucalcin
gene
(
rgn
)
is
localized
on
the
X
chromosome
and
is
identified
in
over
15
species
consisting
the
regucalcin
family
.

Regucalcin
has
been
shown
to
play
a
multifunctional
role
in
cell
regulation;
maintaining
of
intracellular
calcium
homeostasis
and
suppressing
of
signal
transduction
,
translational
protein
synthesis
,
nuclear
deoxyribonucleic
acid
(
DNA
)
and
ribonucleic
acid
(
RNA
)
synthesis
,
proliferation
,
and
apoptosis
in
many
cell
types
.

Moreover
,
regucalcin
may
play
a
pathophysiological
role
in
metabolic
disorder
.

The
expression
of
regucalcin
is
stimulated
through
the
action
of
insulin
in
liver
cells
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
and
it
is
decreased
in
the
liver
of
rats
with
type
I
diabetes
induced
by
streptozotocin
administration
in
vivo
.

Overexpression
of
endogenous
regucalcin
stimulates
glucose
utilization
and
lipid
production
in
liver
cells
with
glucose
supplementation
in

.

Regucalcin
reveals
insulin
resistance
in
liver
cells
.

Deficiency
of
regucalcin
induces
an
impairment
of
glucose
tolerance
and
lipid
accumulation
in
the
liver
of
mice
in
vivo
.

Overexpression
of
endogenous
regucalcin
has
been
shown
to
decrease
triglyceride
,
total
cholesterol
and
glycogen
contents
in
the
liver
of
rats
,
inducing
hyperlipidemia
.

Leptin
and
adiponectin
mRNA
expressions
in
the
liver
tissues
are
decreased
in
regucalcin
transgenic
rats
.

Decrease
in
hepatic
regucalcin
is
associated
with
the
development
and
progression
of
nonalcoholic
fatty
liver
disease
and
fibrosis
in
human
patients
.

Regucalcin
may
be
a
key

BACKGROUND
:
Dopamine
replacement
therapies
(
levodopa
,
dopamine
receptor
agonists
,
anticholinergics
,
monoamine
oxidase
B
inhibitors
,
and
catechol-O-methyltransferase
inhibitors
)
remain
the
cornerstones
of
therapeutic
interventions
for
Parkinson's
disease
(
PD
)
.

Despite
the
treatment
options
for
PD
symptoms
,
a
cure
remains
elusive
.

An
optimal
treatment
would
be
one
that
combined
relief
in
both
motor
and
nonmotor
symptoms
with
neuroprotective
properties
.

Safinamide
is
an
investigational
drug
for
PD
currently
in
development
as
add-on
therapy
to
both
dopamine
agonists
and
levodopa
.

Safinamide
is
a
unique
molecule
with
a
novel
mode
of
action
,
targeting
both
dopaminergic
and
glutaminergic
systems
,
and
potentially
provides
motor
symptom
control
.

Preliminary
results
from
experimental
models
suggest
potential
neuroprotective
effects
.

Studies
on
the
potential
effects
on
nonmotor
symptoms
are
ongoing
.

OBJECTIVE
:
To
review
the
mechanism
of
action
and
pharmacokinetics
,
and
to
evaluate
the
available
clinical
safety
and
efficacy
results
of
safinamide
.

METHODS
:
A
search
of
the
electronic
database
MEDLINE
(
PubMed
,
no
time
limits
)
was
performed
on
14
December
2007
.

The
full
text
of
all
citations
was
obtained
for
review
.

Furthermore
,
two
abstracts
on
safinamide
published
as
proceedings
of
a
European
conference
were
reviewed
.

RESULTS
/
CONCLUSION
:
Safinamide
is
a
promising
investigational
drug
for
PD
with
a
novel
mode
of
action
.

Early
reports
confirm
the
potential
efficacy
of
safinamide
in
PD
.

Further
studies
on
potential
effects
on
cognition
and
neuroprotection
are
needed
.
OBJECTIVE
:
Tricyclic
antidepressants
(
TCAs
)
are
one
of
the
first-line
pharmacological
treatments
against
neuropathic
pain
.

TCAs
increase
the
extracellular
concentrations
of
noradrenaline
and
serotonin
by
blocking
the
reuptake
transporters
of
these
amines
.

However
,
the
precise
downstream
mechanism
leading
to
the
therapeutic
action
remains
identified
.

In
this
work
,
we
evaluated
the
role
of
adrenergic
receptors
(
ARs
)
in
the
action
of
TCAs
.

METHODS
:
We
used
pharmacological
and
genetic
approaches
in
mice
to
study
the
role
of
ARs
in
the
antiallodynic
action
of
the
TCA
nortriptyline
.

Peripheral
neuropathy
was
induced
by
the
insertion
of
a
polyethylene
cuff
around
the
main
branch
of
the
sciatic
nerve
.

The
specific
role
of
beta
(
2
)
-AR
was
evaluated
by
studying
beta
(
2
)
-AR
(
-
/
-
)
mice
.

We
used
von
Frey
filaments
to
assess
mechanical
allodynia
.

RESULTS
:
The
antiallodynic
action
of
nortriptyline
was
not
affected
by
cotreatment
with
the
alpha
(
2
)
-AR
antagonist
yohimbine
,
the
beta
(
1
)
-AR
antagonists
atenolol
or
metoprolol
,
or
the
beta
(
3
)
-AR
antagonist
SR
59230A
.

On
the
contrary
,
the
beta-AR
antagonists
propranolol
or
sotalol
,
the
beta
(
1
)
/
beta
(
2
)
-AR
antagonists
alprenolol
or
pindolol
,
or
the
specific
beta
(
2
)
-AR
antagonist
ICI
118
,
551
blocked
the
action
of
nortriptyline
.

The
effect
of
nortriptyline
was
also
totally
absent
in
beta
(
2
)
-AR-deficient
mice
.

INTERPRETATION
:
Stimulation
of
beta
(
2
)
-AR
is
necessary
for
nortriptyline
to
exert
its
antiallodynic
action
against
neuropathic
pain
.

These
findings
provide
new
insight
into
the
mechanism
by
which
antidepressants
alleviate
neuropathic
pain
.

Our
results
also
raise
the
question
of
a
potential
incompatibility
between
beta-blockers
that
affect
beta
(
2
)
-AR
and
antidepressant
drugs
in
patients
treated
for
neuropathic
pain
.
The
ethyl

were
evaluated
for
their
antioxidant
capacities
by

DPPH
)
free
radical

activity
and
β-carotene

.

Both
extracts
exhibited
strong

against
the

81
and

(

,
respectively
)
and
strong

in
β-carotene

.

Both

were
found
to
have
high
phenolic

with
values
of
39
and
44mg

g
as
indicated
by
Follin-Ciocalteau's

.

Antioxidant
TLC
assay-guided
isolation
on
the
methanol
extract
led
to
the
isolation
of
a
new
pyranocoumarin
,
glabranin
(
1
)
,
umbelliferone
(
2
)
,
scopoletin
(
3
)
and
sesamin
(
4
)
,
and
their
structures
were
determined
by
spectroscopy
.

Compounds
(
1-3
)
showed
significant
activities
on
DPPH

with
the
IC50
of
240
.
20
,
810
.
02
and
413
.
19μgml
(
-1
)
,
respectively
.

However
,
in
β-carotene
bleaching
assay
,
sesamin
(
4
)
showed
higher
inhibitory
activity
(
1mgml
(

,
95%
)
than
glabranin
(
1
)
(
1mgml
(

,
74%
)
,
whilst
umbelliferone
(

were
slightly
pro-oxidant

Taxanes
are
one
of
the
most
powerful
classes
of
compounds
among
all
chemotherapeutic
drugs
.

Only
30
years
separate
the
isolation
of
the
first
taxane
from
the
results
of
direct
clinical
comparisons
in
metastatic
breast
,
ovarian
,
and
lung
cancer
between
the
two
taxanes
available
in
routine
clinical
practice
.

These
results
suggest
a
more
favorable
benefit-to-risk
ratio
for
docetaxel
compared
to
paclitaxel
when
these
drugs
are
used
as
single
agents
or
in
combination
with
other
chemotherapeutic
agents
in
an
every-3-week
dosing
regimen
.

Pharmacological
data
support
the
difference
between
the
taxanes
,
likely
explaining
the
clinical
results
.

Considering
the
molecular
pharmacology
of
the
two
drugs
,
docetaxel
appears
to
bind
to
beta-tubulin
with
greater
affinity
and
has
a
wider
cell
cycle
activity
than
paclitaxel
.

Docetaxel
also
appears
to
have
direct
antitumoral
activity
via
an
apoptotic
effect
mediated
by
bcl-2
phosphorylation
.

In
addition
,
docetaxel
has
a
longer
retention
time
in
tumor
cells
than
paclitaxel
because
of
greater
uptake
and
slower
efflux
.

Pharmacokinetics
and
pharmacodynamics
of
the
taxanes
show
both
agents
to
be
extensively
metabolized
in
the
liver
,
and
paclitaxel
has
a
nonlinear
pharmacokinetic
behavior
while
docetaxel
has
linear
pharmacokinetics
.

These
differences
explain
the
more
simple
treatment
schedule
and
favorable
results
for
docetaxel
as
a
single
agent
and
in
combination
therapy
.

Last
,
but
not
least
,
there
is
a
pharmacokinetic
interaction
between
paclitaxel
and
the
anthracyclines
,
an
active
class
of
compounds
commonly
used
in
the
treatment
of
breast
cancer
.

This
pharmacokinetic
interaction
is
associated
with
greater
cardio-
and
myelotoxicities
,
which
are
sequence
dependent
.

These
pharmacological
data
likely
explain
the
different
clinical
development
strategies
for
the
two
molecules
as
well
as
the
different
clinical
results
from
individual
trials
and
direct
comparisons
.
Botulinum
toxin
(
BoNT
)
is
a
potent
neurotoxin
that
is
produced
by
the
gram-positive
,
spore-forming
,
anaerobic
bacterium
,
Clostridum
botulinum
.

There
are
7
known
immunologically
distinct
serotypes
of
BoNT
:
types
A
,
B
,
C1
,
D
,
E
,
F
,
and
G
.

Clostridum
neurotoxins
are
produced
as
a
single
inactive
polypeptide
chain
of
150kDa
,
which
is
cleaved
by
tissue
proteinases
into
an
active
di-chain
molecule
:
a
heavy
chain
(
H
)
of
∼100kDa
and
a
light
chain
(
L
)
of
∼50kDa
held
together
by
a
single
disulfide
bond
.

Each
serotype
demonstrates
its
own
varied
mechanisms
of
action
and
duration
of
effect
.

The
heavy
chain
of
each
BoNT
serotype
binds
to
its
specific
neuronal
ecto-acceptor
,
whereby
,
membrane
translocation
and
endocytosis
by
intracellular
synaptic
vesicles
occurs
.

The
light
chain
acts
to
cleave
SNAP-25
,
which
inhibits
synaptic
exocytosis
,
and
therefore
,
disables
neural
transmission
.

The
action
of
BoNT
to
block
the
release
of
acetylcholine
botulinum
toxin
at
the
neuromuscular
junction
is
best
understood
,
however
,
most
experts
acknowledge
that
this
effect
alone
appears
inadequate
to
explain
the
entirety
of
the
neurotoxin's
apparent
analgesic
activity
.

Consequently
,
scientific
and
clinical
evidence
has
emerged
that
suggests
multiple
antinociceptive
mechanisms
for
botulinum
toxins
in
a
variety
of
painful
disorders
,
including
:
chronic
musculoskeletal
,
neurological
,
pelvic
,
perineal
,
osteoarticular
,
and
some
headache
conditions

serotonin
(
5-hydroxytryptamine;
5HT
)
transporter
cDNA
,
denoted
dSERT1
,
was
isolated
and
characterized
in
oocytes
.

dSERT1
shows
little
transport
of
other
monoamines
and
is
Na

and
Cl-

.

Sequence
analysis
indicates

strong
homologies
(
approximately
50%
)
among
dSERT1
and
mammalian
5HT
,
norepinephrine
,
and
dopamine
transporters
.

Interestingly
,
the
pharmacological
properties
of
dSERT1
,
including
sensitivity
to
antidepressants
,
are
more
similar
to
those
of
mammalian
catecholamine

than
to
mammalian

.

paronychioides
(

exhibited
the

also
had

Results
showed
that

protected

through
several

,
including
:

Bisphenol
A
(
BPA
)
has
been
widely
used
in
the
manufacture
of
polycarbonate
plastic
,
water
bottles
and
food
containers
.

Previous
studies
have
established
that
BPA
could
cause
developmental
toxicity
by
inhibiting
the
proliferation
and
differentiation
of
rat
embryonic
midbrain
(
MB
)
cells
in
vitro
.

However
,
the
underlying
mechanisms
have
not
been
well
studied
yet
.

In
the
current
study
,
we
examined
the
proliferation
and
differentiation
of
MB
cells
treated
with
10
(
-12
)
-10
(
-4
)
M
BPA
and
found
that
only
10
(
-4
)
M
BPA
inhibited
proliferation
and
differentiation
.

Then
,
we
investigated
the
cell
cycle
progression
and
apoptosis
of
MB
cells;
10
(
-4
)
M
BPA
caused
an
explicit
S
phase
and
G2
/
M
phase
arrest
in
the
cell
cycle
and
increased
the
percentage
of
apoptotic
cells
.

Moreover
,
the
phosphorylation
of
mitogen-activated
protein
kinase
(
MAPK
)
and
cyclic-AMP
response
binding
protein
(
CREB
)
and
the
expression
of
some
apoptotic
regulatory
genes
were
investigated
.

BPA
(
10
(
-4
)
M
)
reduced
the
phosphorylation
of
C-Jun
N-terminal
kinase
(
JNK
)
and
CREB
,
and
increased
the
mRNA
expression
level
of
Bax
and
p53
.

Our
findings
demonstrated
that
BPA
could
cause
developmental
toxicity
through
anti-proliferation
and
pro-apoptosis
in
MB
cells
.

Multiple
signaling
pathways
,
such
as
the
JNK
,
CREB
and
p53-mitochondrial
apoptosis
pathways
,
participate
in
these
effects
.
Human
8p11
stem
cell
leukemia
/
lymphoma
syndrome
usually
presents
as
a
myeloproliferative
disorder
(
MPD
)
that
evolves
to
acute
myeloid
leukemia
and
/
or
lymphoma
.

The
syndrome
associated
with
t
(
8;13
)
(
p11;q12
)
results
in
expression
of
the
ZNF198-FGFR1
fusion
tyrosine
kinase
that
plays
a
pathogenic
role
in
hematopoietic
transformation
.

We
found
that
ZNF198-FGFR1
activated
both
the
AKT
and
mitogen
activated
protein
kinase
(
MAPK
)
prosurvival
signaling
pathways
,
resulting
in
elevated
phosphorylation
of
the
AKT
target
FOXO3a
at
T32
and
BAD
at
S112
,
respectively
.

These
phosphorylated
residues
subsequently
sequestered
the
proapoptotic
FOXO3a
and
BAD
to
14-3-3
to
prevent
apoptosis
.

We
used
a
peptide-based
14-3-3
competitive
antagonist
,
R18
,
to
disrupt
14-3-3-ligand
association
.

Expression
of
R18
effectively
induced
apoptosis
in
hematopoietic
Ba
/
F3
cells
transformed
by
ZNF198-FGFR1
compared
with
control
cells
.

Moreover
,
purified
recombinant
transactivator
of
transcription
(
TAT
)
-conjugated
R18
proteins
effectively
transduced
into
human
leukemia
cells
and
induced
significant
apoptosis
in
KG-1a
cells
expressing
FGFR1OP2-FGFR1
fusion
tyrosine
kinase
but
not
in
control
HL-60
and
Jurkat
T
cells
.

Surprisingly
,
R18
was
only
able
to
dissociate
FOXO3a
,
but
not
BAD
as
previously
proposed
,
from
14-3-3
binding
and
induced
apoptosis
partially
through
liberation
and
reactivation
of
FOXO3a
.

Our
findings
suggest
that
14-3-3
integrates
prosurvival
signals
in
FGFR1
fusion-transformed
hematopoietic
cells
.

Disrupting
14-3-3-ligand

Schizophrenia
is
characterized
by
a
range
of
positive
and
negative
symptoms
,
and
cognitive
deficits
.

While
positive
symptoms
respond
to
current
antipsychotic
agents
,
negative
symptoms
and
cognitive
deficits
are
often
resistant
to
pharmacopea
.

Thus
research
is
now
focused
on
developing
third-generation
antipsychotics
that
combine
antagonism
or
partial
agonism
at
dopamine
D
(
2
)
-like
receptors
with
agonism
at
serotonin
5-HT
(
1A
)
receptors
.

Such
an
association
is
anticipated
to
provide
therapeutic
benefits
against
a
broader
range
of
schizophrenia
symptoms
.

Bifeprunox
is
one
such
third-generation
antipsychotic
agent
which
acts
as
a
partial
agonist
at
D
(
2
)
-like
receptors
and
is
an
efficacious
agonist
at
5-HT
(
1A
)
receptors
,
with
little
interaction
at
5HT
(
2A
/
2C
)
,
muscarinic
or
histaminergic
H
(
1
)
receptors
.

This
review
summarizes
the
pharmacological
profiles
of
the
current
antipsychotic
agents
and
describes
the
rationale
behind
the
development
of
third-generation
antipsychotics
.

It
also
evaluates
current
data
concerning
bifeprunox
in
comparison
with
currently
available
antipsychotics
,
as
well
as
those
that
are
still
under
clinical
development
.

The
aim

the
psychophysical
effects
of
both
TRPA1
and
TRPM8
activation
in
humans
by
application
of
either
cinnamaldehyde

.

We
applied
10%
cinnamaldehyde
or
40%
menthol
solutions
on
the
forearm
in
10
study
participants
.

Quantitative
sensory
testing
and
laser
Doppler
imaging
was
performed
before
and
after
exposure
to
the
compounds
.

Cinnamaldehyde
evoked
significant
spontaneous
pain
and
induced
heat
and
mechanical
hyperalgesia
,
cold
hypoalgesia
and
a
neurogenic
axon
reflex
erythema
.

In
contrast
,
TRPM8
activation
by
menthol
produced
no
axon
reflex
reaction
and
resulted
in
cold
hyperalgesia
.

We
conclude
that
agonists
of
TRPA1
and
TRPM8
channels
produce
strikingly
different
psychophysical
patterns

On
the
basis
of
data
obtained
in
rabbits
,
the
imidazoline
receptor
ligand
rilmenidine
has
been
suggested
to
decrease
blood
pressure
in
humans
by
activating
central
alpha
(
2A
)
-adrenoceptors
.

A
prerequisite
for
this
hypothesis
was
the
unproved
assumption
that
rabbit
and
human
alpha
(
2A
)
-adrenoceptors
are
equally
activated
by
rilmenidine
.

Because
alpha
(
2A
)
-adrenoceptors
in
the
brain
and
on
cardiovascular
sympathetic
nerve
terminals
are
identical
,
the
latter
were
used
as
a
model
for
the
former
to
confirm
or
disprove
this
assumption
.

Human
atrial
appendages
and
rabbit
pulmonary
arteries
were
used
to
determine
the
potencies
of
alpha
(
2
)
-adrenoceptor
agonists
in
inhibiting
the
electrically
(
2
Hz
)
evoked
[
(
3
)
H
]
norepinephrine
release
and
of
antagonists
in
counteracting
the
alpha
(
2
)
-adrenoceptor-mediated
inhibition
induced
by
moxonidine
.

In
the
rabbit
pulmonary
artery
,
rilmenidine
and
oxymetazoline
are
potent
full
agonists
,
whereas
in
the
human
atrial
appendages
they
are
antagonists
at
the
alpha
(
2
)
-autoreceptors
,
sharing
this
property
with
rauwolscine
,
phentolamine
,
and
idazoxan
.

In
contrast
,
prazosin
is
ineffective
.

In
addition
,
a
partial
nucleotide
and
amino
acid
sequence
of
the
rabbit
alpha
(
2A
)
-adrenoceptor
(
a
region
known
to
substantially
influence
the
pharmacological
characteristics
of
the
alpha
(
2
)
-adrenoceptor
)
revealed
marked
differences
between
the
rabbit
and
the
human
alpha
(
2A
)
-adrenoceptor
.

The
sympathetic
nerves
of
both
the
human
atrial
appendages
and
rabbit
pulmonary
artery
are
endowed
with
alpha
(
2A
)
-autoreceptors
,
at
which
,
however
,
both
rilmenidine
and
oxymetazoline
exhibit
different
properties
(
antagonism
and
agonism
,
respectively
)
.

The
antagonistic
property
of
rilmenidine
at
human
alpha
(
2A
)
-adrenoceptors
indicates
that
in
contrast
to
the
suggestion
based
on
rabbit
data
,
the
hypotensive
property
of
the
drug
in
humans
is
not
due
to
activation
of
alpha
(
2A
)
-adrenoceptors
but
other
,
presumably
I
(
1
)
-imidazoline
receptors
,
are
probably
involved
.
Human
follistatin
is
a
regulatory
glycoprotein
with
widespread
biologic
functions
,
including
antiinflammatory
activities
,
wound-healing
properties
,
and
muscle-stimulating
effects
.

The
role
of
follistatin
in
a
wide
range
of
biologic
activities
shows
promise
for
potential
clinical
application
,
which
has
prompted
considerable
interest
in
the
investigation
of
the
protein
as
a
potential
disease-modifying
agent
.

In
spite
of
this
potential
,
the
development
of
follistatin
as
a
broad
use
biotherapeutic
has
been
severely
hindered
by
a
poor
understanding
and
characterization
of
its
pharmacokinetic
/
pharmacodynamic
(
PK
/
PD
)
relationships
.

Therefore
,
to
better
define
these
relationships
,
we
performed
in-depth
analyses
of
the
PK
/
PD
relationships
of
native
follistatin-315
(
FST315
)
.

Our
data
indicate
that
the
intrinsic
PK
/
PD
properties
of
native
FST315
are
poorly
suited
for
acting
as
a
parentally
administered
biotherapeutic
with
broad
systemic
effects
.

Here
,
we
leveraged
protein
engineering
to
modify
the
PK
characteristics
of
the
native
molecule
by
fusing
FST315
to
a
murine
IgG
(
1
)
Fc
and
removing
the
intrinsic
heparan
sulfate-binding
activity
of
follistatin
.

The
engineered
variant
molecule
had
~100-
and
~1600-fold
improvements
in
terminal
half-life
and
exposure
,
respectively
.

In
contrast
to
the
native
FST315
,
the
variant
showed
a
robust
,
dose-dependent
pharmacological
effect
when
administered
subcutaneously
on
a
weekly
basis
in
mouse
models
of
muscle
atrophy
and
degeneration
.

These
studies
highlight
the
underappreciated
and
critical
relationship
between
optimizing
multiple
physical
and
chemical
properties
of
follistatin
on
its
overall
PK
/
PD
profile
.

Moreover
,
our
findings
provide
the
first
documented
strategy
toward
the
development
of
a
follistatin
therapeutic
with
potential
use
in
patients
affected
with
skeletal
muscle
diseases

showed

In

performed

uptake
was
similar

Prevalent
use
of
bisphenol-A
(
BPA
)
in
the
manufacture
of
resins
,
plastics
and
paper
products
has
led
to
frequent
exposure
of
most
people
to
this
endocrine
disruptor
.

Some
rodent
studies
have
suggested
that
BPA
can
exert
detrimental
effects
on
brain
development
.

However
as
rodent
models
cannot
be
relied
on
to
predict
consequences
of
human
exposure
to
BPA
during
development
,
it
is
important
to
investigate
the
effects
of
BPA
on
non-human
primate
brain
development
.

Previous
research
suggests
that
BPA
preferentially
targets
dopamine
neurons
in
ventral
mesencephalon
and
glutamatergic
neurons
in
hippocampus
,
so
the
present
work
examined
the
susceptibility
of
these
systems
to
low
dose
BPA
exposure
at
the
fetal
and
juvenile
stages
of
development
in
non-human
primates
.

Exposure
of
pregnant
rhesus
monkeys
to
relatively
low
levels
of
BPA
during
the
final
2
months
of
gestation
,
induced
abnormalities
in
fetal
ventral
mesencephalon
and
hippocampus
.

Specifically
,
light
microscopy
revealed
a
decrease
in
tyrosine
hydroxylase-expressing
(
dopamine
)
neurons
in
the
midbrain
of
BPA-exposed
fetuses
and
electron
microscopy
identified
a
reduction
in
spine
synapses
in
the
CA1
region
of
hippocampus
.

In
contrast
,
administration
of
BPA
to
juvenile
vervet
monkeys
(
14-18
months
of
age
)
was
without
effect
on
these
indices
,
or
on
dopamine
and
serotonin
concentrations
in
striatum
and
prefrontal
cortex
,
or
on
performance
of
a

task

.

These
data
indicate
that
BPA
exerts
an

impact

development

levels
within
the
range

a
male-specific
gene
controlled
by
pulsatile
GH
via
signal
transducer
and
activator
of
transcription
5b
(
STAT5b
)
.

To
determine
if
these
effects
of
MC
depend
on
hepatic
microsomal
P450-mediated
activity
,
we
examined
biologic
responses
to
MC
treatment
in
liver
Cpr-null
(
LCN
)
mice
with
hepatocyte-specific
conditional
deletion
of
NADPH-cytochrome

(
POR
)
.

MC
caused
mild
induction
of
Por
and
a
hepatic
inflammatory
marker
in
wild-type
mice
,
whereas
MC
caused
strong
induction
of
AHR
target
genes
,
Cyp1a1
,
Cyp1a2
,
and
Cyp1b1
in
wild-type
and

mice
.

Two
mouse
hepatic
STAT5b
target
genes
,
Cyp2d9
and
major
urinary
protein
2
(
Mup2
)
,
were
suppressed
by
MC
in
wild-type
mice
,
and
the
CYP2D9
mRNA
response
was
maintained
in
LCN
mice
.

In
wild-type
mice
only
,
MC
decreased
hepatic
GH
receptor
(
GHR
)
mRNA
but
increased
GHR
protein
levels
.

There
was
an
apparent
impairment
of
STAT5
phosphorylation
by
MC
in
wild-type
and
LCN
mice
,
but
large
interanimal
variation
prevented
achievement
of
statistical
significance
.

In
vehicle-treated
mice
,
basal

of
MUP2
mRNA
,
GHR
mRNA
,
GHR
protein
,
and
the
activation
status
of
extracellular
signal-regulated
kinase
2
and
Akt
were
influenced
by
hepatic
Por
genetic
status
.

These
results
indicate
that
the
effects
of
MC
on
hepatic
GH
signaling
components
and
target
genes
are
complex
,
involving
aspects
that
are
both
dependent

Cisplatin-induced
nephrotoxicity
is
a
serious
problem
that
limits
its
use
in
cancer
treatment
.

The
present
study
aimed
to
investigate
the
renal
protective
capacity
of
pioglitazone
to
reduce
the
cisplatin-
induced
nephrotoxicity
.

The
underlying
suggested
mechanism
(
s
)
and
whether
this
nephroprotective
effect
(
if
any
)
interferes
with
the
cytotoxic
effect
of
cisplatin
on
cancer
cells
were
also
investigated
.

Pioglitazone
,
Bisphenol
A

,

injected
(
Peroxisome

,
or
their
combination
were
administered
to
rats
one
hour
before
cisplatin
injection
.

Moreover
,
their
effects
on
the
cell
viability
of
human
renal
adenocarcinoma
cell
models
(
ACHN
)
were
studied
.

The
obtained
results
showed
that
pioglitazone
improved
the
renal
function
,
structural
changes
,
renal
malondialdehyde

,

in

injected
rats
.

It
increased
both
renal

(
GSH
)
content
and
PPAR-γ
gene
expression
.

In
contrast
to
the
data
obtained
by
prior
administration
of
BADGE
.

Pioglitazone
also
potentiated
the
cytotoxic
effect
of
cisplatin
on
human
renal
adenocarcinoma
cells
and
this
effect
was
abolished
by
BADGE
co
administration
.

In
conclusion
,
these
results
suggested
that
pioglitazone
protected
against
cisplatin-
induced
nephrotoxicity
through
its
interaction
with
PPAR-γ
receptors
and
antioxidant
effects
.

Furthermore
,
pioglitazone
did
not
interfere
but
rather
potentiated
the
cytotoxic
effects
of
cisplatin
on
human
renal
adenocarcinoma
cells
.

or

,
were
activated
by
apocalmodulin
(
ApoCaM
)
to
an
extent
of
60%
.

Both
truncated
forms
of
GAD67
(
tGAD67
)
,
HGAD67
(
Delta1-70
)
and
HGAD67
(
Delta1-90
)
,
were
markedly
activated
by
ApoCaM
to
an
extent
of
141
and
85%
,
respectively
,
while
GST-HGAD67
was
not
significantly
affected
.

The
activation
appears
to
be
due
to
an
increase
of
GAD
affinity
for
its
cofactor
,
pyridoxal
phosphate
(
PLP
)
.

This
conclusion
is
based
on
the
following
observations
.

Firstly
,
the
V
(
max
)
of
GAD
was
increased
when
ApoCaM
was
present
whereas
the
affinity
for
the
substrate
,
glutamate
,
was
not
affected
.

Secondly
,
the
affinity
of
GAD
for
PLP
was
increased
in
the
presence
of
ApoCaM
.

Thirdly
,
results
from
calmodulin-agarose
affinity
column
chromatography
studies
indicated
a
direct
interaction
or
binding
between
ApoCaM
and
GAD
.

Fourthly
,
ApoCaM
was
found
to
be
copurified
with
GAD65
/
GAD67
by
anti-GAD65
/
67
immunoaffinity
column
using
rat
brain
extract
.

Hence
,
it
is
proposed
that
a
conformational
change
is
induced
when
ApoCaM
interacts
with
GAD65
or
tGAD67
,
resulting
in
an
increase
of
GAD
affinity
for
PLP
and
the
activation
of
GAD
.

The
physiological
significance
of
the
interaction
between
GAD
and
ApoCaM
is
discussed

on
the

Two-dimensional

Furthermore

Our

suggest
that
1

led
to

,
as
shown
by

Structural
correlates
of
ligand
binding
to
alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-
4-isoxazolepropionic
acid
(
AMPA
)
receptors
were
examined
by
altering
conserved
lysine
residues
to
either
glutamate
or
glutamate
at
position
445
of
the
GluR-A
subunit
and
position
449
of
the
GluR-B
subunit
.

Receptors
were
expressed
in
human
embryonic
kidney
293
cells
and
in
Xenopus
oocytes
as
homomeric
GluR-A
or
heteromeric
combinations
of
GluR-A
/
B
.

The
functional
properties
of
the
resulting
receptors
were
measured
with
patch-clamp
and
voltage-clamp
electrophysiology
.

These
mutations
,
which
reduced
the
total
positive
charge
at
the
lysine
445
position
,
selectively
altered
the
affinity
of
some
ligands
and
had
no
obvious
effect
on
receptor
desensitization
properties
.

The
L-glutamate
EC50
was

microM
when
wild-type
GluR-A
was
coexpressed
with
GluR-B
(

/
B
)
and
38
.
9
microM
when
GluR-A445Q
/
B449Q
receptors
were
tested
.

The
AMPA
EC50
was
similarly
reduced
(

,
3
.
71
microM;
GluR-A445Q
/
B449Q
,
21
.

microM
)
.

Receptors
containing
a
glutamate
residue
at
this
position
were
even
less
sensitive
to
L-glutamate
and
AMPA
.

Whereas
the
apparent
potency
of
L-glutamate
varied
inversely
with
the
total
positive
charge
regardless
of
the
subunit
,
the
affinity
of
AMPA
was
more
sensitive
to
mutations
in
GluR-A
than
to
those
in
GluR-B
.

Interestingly
,
the
EC50
of
kainate
was
unaffected
by
most
of
these
mutations
and
actually
increased
slightly
with
GluR-A445E
/
B449E
receptors
.

The
affinity
of
6-cyano-2
,
3-dihydroxy-7-
nitroquinoxaline
(
CNQX
)
was
slightly
reduced
with
GluR-A445E
/
B449E
receptors
,
whereas
the
apparent
affinity
of
GYKI52466
was
unchanged
.

These
data
confirm
that
structural
correlates
of
binding
to
AMPA
receptors
vary
among
different
ligands
.

than

The
latter
was
also
reflected
by
lower

.

We
found
no

The
findings
suggest
that
the

may
include
reduced

However
,
the
mechanisms

This

was
undertaken
to
elucidate
the
mechanism

that
have
the

the

were
obtained

increased
alpha-tocopherol

dose-dependent
manner
.

Second
,
probucol
,
an
antiatherogenic
compound
reported
to
be
an
inactivator
of

reduced
hepatic
alpha-tocopherol
secretion
.

Third

,
addition
of
1%

diet
decreased
plasma
alpha-tocopherol

These
results
strongly
suggest
that
ABCA1
is
substantially
involved
in
hepatic
alpha-tocopherol
secretion

OBJECTIVE
:
To
report
on
a
patient
developing
hepatic
veno-occlusive
disease
while
being
treated
with
immunosuppressive
doses
of
cyclophosphamide
(
<
or
=
2
mg
/
kg
)
.

CASE
SUMMARY
:
A
66-year-old
woman
with
autoimmune
hemolytic
anemia
developed
hepatic
veno-occlusive
disease
while
being
treated
with
immunosuppressive
cyclophosphamide
100
mg
/
day
in
combination
with
roxithromycin
(
total
dose
600
mg
/
day
)
.

After
all
drugs
were
stopped
,
the
patient
recovered
within
2
weeks
.

The
Naranjo
probability
scale
indicated
a
probable
relationship
between
veno-occlusive
disease
and
treatment
with
cyclophosphamide
in
this
patient
.

DISCUSSION
:
Since
roxithromycin
inhibits
CYP3A4
,
which
is
involved
with
cyclophosphamide
metabolism
,
a
drug-drug
interaction
could
have
been
responsible
.

In
addition
,
roxithromycin
is
an
inhibitor
of
the
drug
transporter
P-glycoprotein
,
possibly
leading
to
accumulation
of
cyclophosphamide
in
endothelial
cells
.

Alternatively
,
since
cyclophosphamide
has
been
reported
to
induce

CONCLUSIONS
:
In
specific
patients
,
cyclophosphamide
can
be
associated
with
hepatic

at

doses
.
BACKGROUND
:
Clinical
studies
suggest
a
survival
advantage
in
cancer
patients
receiving
low
molecular
weight
heparin
(
LMWH
)
.

A
suggested
mechanism
for
this
beneficial
effect
may
reside
in
the
antiangiogenic
activity
of
heparins
.

OBJECTIVES
:
In
this
study
we
investigated
whether
two
different
LMWHs
,
i
.

e
.

enoxaparin
and
dalteparin
,
and
unfractionated
heparin
(
UFH
)
,
affect
the
angiogenic
potential
of
human
microvascular
endothelial
cells
(
HMEC-1
)
promoted
by
tumor
cells
.

METHODS
:
HMEC-1
cells
were
incubated
with
tumor
cell
conditioned
media
(
TCM
)
derived
from
human
breast
cancer
and
leukemic
cells
(
i
.

e
.

MCF-7
,
MDA
.

MB
.
231
,
and
NB4
cell
lines
)
or
recombinant
cytokines
(
i
.

e
.

VEGF
,
FGF-2
,
TNF-alpha
)
+
/
-heparins
.

Capillary-like
tube
formation
in
Matrigel
and
cell
proliferation
were
evaluated
.

RESULTS
:
All
three
TCM
induced
a
significant
(
p<0
.
05
)
increase
in
total
length
of
tubes
formed
by
HMEC-1
in
Matrigel
.

These
increases
were
significantly
counteracted
(
62
to
100%
mean
inhibition
)
by
enoxaparin
and
dalteparin
,
but
were
significantly
less
affected
by
UFH
.

Similarly
,
the
tube
formation
induced
by
standard
VEGF
,
FGF-2
,
or
TNF-alpha
was
100%
inhibited
by
enoxaparin
,
and
70-90%
by
dalteparin
,
whereas
minor
or
no
inhibition
was
observed
with
UFH
.

VEGF
was
the
most
active
cytokine
in
TCM
of
both
breast
cancer
and
leukemic
cells
.

EC
proliferation
was
significantly
increased
by
standard
angiogenic
factors
,
and
slightly
affected
by
breast
cancer
TCM
(
p
=
ns
)
.

The
addition
of
heparins
significantly
counteracted
the
proliferative
stimuli
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
These
results
support
a
major
role
for
LMWH
compared
to
UFH
in
inhibiting
the
proangiogenic
effect
exerted
by
tumor
cells
or
purified
angiogenic
factors
on
microvascular
endothelium
.
GABA
receptor
activation
in
central
nervous
white
matter
may
be
protective
during
white
matter
hypoxia
in
the
adult
,
and
it
may
modify
axonal
conduction
,
especially
in
the
developing
brain
.

GABA
uptake
is
important
for
the
shaping
of
the
GABA
signal
,
but
quantitative
data
are
lacking
for
GABA
uptake
and
GABA-metabolizing
enzymes
in
central
nervous
white
matter
.

We
report
that
high-affinity
uptake
of
GABA
in
adult
pig
corpus
callosum
,
fimbria
,
subcortical
pyramidal
tracts
,
and
occipital
white
matter
is
approximately
20%
of
that
in
temporal
cortex
gray
matter
.

Tiagabine
(
0
.
1
microM
)
,
an
antiepileptic
drug
that
specifically
inhibits
the
GAT-1
GABA
transporter
inhibited
GABA
uptake
50%
in
temporal
cortex
and
60-68%
in
white
structures
.

This
finding
indicates
that
GAT-1
is
an
important
GABA
transporter
in
white
matter
and
suggests
that
white
matter
GABA
uptake
is
inhibited
during
tiagabine
therapy
.

GABA
transaminase
activity
in
white
structures
was
approximately
20%
of
neocortical
values
.

Glutamate
decarboxylase
(
GAD
)
activity
in
white
structures
was
only
4%
of
that
in
neocortex
(
7-12
pmol
/
mg
tissue
x
min
(
-1
)
versus
approximately
200
pmol
/
mg
tissue
x
min
(
-1
)
)
.

Since
white
matter
activity
of
citrate
synthase
of
the
tricarboxylic
acid
cycle
was
approximately
25%
of
neocortical
values
(
approximately
0

4

min
(
-1
)
versus
approximately
1
.
5
nmol
/

tissue
x
min
(
-1

)
,
the
low
GAD
activity
suggests
a
slower
metabolic
turnover
of
GABA
in
white
than
in
gray
matter

Twelve
alkyl

(
1-12
)
of
the
high-affinity
serotonin
transporter
(
SERT
)
inhibitor
6-nitroquipazine
(
6-NQ
)
were
synthesized
and
studied
using
in

radioligand
competition
binding
assays
to
determine
their
binding
affinity
(
Ki
)
.

The
putative
antidepressant
activity
of
five
of
the
binders
with
the
highest
SERT
binding
affinities
was
studied
by
the
forced
swim

mouse
tests
.

The
three-dimensional
(
3D
)
structures
of
8
and

were
determined
using

technique
.

Flexible
docking
of
the
compounds
was
undertaken
to
illustrate
the
binding
of
the
compounds
in
the
SERT
model
.

Our
results
showed
that
several
of
the
6-NQ
analogues
are
high-affinity
SERT
inhibitors
and
indicated
that
the
octyl
(
8
)
,
decyl
(

and
dodecyl
(

)
6-NQ
analogues
exhibit

Neuroinflammation
and
oxidative
stress
are
involved
in
the
pathogenesis
of
neurodegenerative
diseases
such
as
Alzheimer's
diseases
and
Parkinson's
disease
.

Naturally
derived
kavalactones
isolated
from
Piper
methysticum
(
Piperaceae
)
have
been
shown
to
exhibit
neuroprotective
effects
.

We
have
previously
reported
that
a
chemically
synthesized
kavalactone
derivative
,
2'
,
6'-dichloro-5-methoxymethyl-5
,
6-dehydrokawain
(
compound
1
)
protects
against
oxidative
stress-induced
neuronal
cell
death
through
activation
of
Nrf2
signaling
.

In
the
present
study
,
we
examined
the
effect
of
compound
1
on
neuroinflammation
.

In
BV2
microglial
cells
,
compound
1
strongly
inhibited
LPS-stimulated
iNOS
induction
and
NO
production
,
but
did
not
affect
LPS-stimulated
induction
of
COX2
.

At
6h
after
LPS
challenge
,
when
iNOS
induction
was
not
clearly
seen
,
treatment
with
LPS
or
compound
1
alone
increased
expression
of
heme
oxygenase
1
(
HO-1
)
whose
transcription
is
regulated
by
Nrf2
.

When
treated
with
both
,
compound
1
enhanced
LPS-stimulated
HO-1
induction
,
which
was
more
evident
at
24h
after
LPS
treatment
.

Furthermore
,
LPS-stimulated
activation
of
Nrf2
signaling
and
nuclear
translocation
of
Nrf2
were
potentiated
by
compound
1
.

The
mechanism
by
which
compound
1
activated
Nrf2
signaling
was
supposed
to
be
a
covalent
modification
of
the
sulfhydryl
groups
of
Keap1
by
an
α
,
β-unsaturated
carbonyl
group
present
in
the
compound
1
.

Treatment
with
hemin
,
a
HO-1
inducer
,
and
with
[
Ru
(
CO
)
3Cl2
]
2
,
a
CO
donor
,
decreased
LPS-stimulated
iNOS
induction
and
NO
production
.

In
contrast
,
siRNA-mediated
knockdown
of
HO-1
expression
reduced
the
inhibitory
effect
of
compound
1
on
LPS-stimulated
iNOS
induction
and
NO
production
.

The
compound
1
inhibited
LPS-stimulated
ERK
phosphorylation
after
LPS
treatment
.

Finally
,
compound
1
suppressed
LPS
/
IFN-γ-stimulated
NO
production
in
primary
microglial
cells
.

These
results
suggest
that
compound
1
is
capable
of
inhibiting
LPS-stimulated
iNOS
induction
and
NO
production
via
activation
of
Nrf2
signaling
and
HO-1
induction
in
microglial
cells
.

Taken
together
,
compound
1
has
a
potential
to
reduce
neuroinflammation
as
well
as
oxidative
stress
in
neurodegenerative
diseases
through
activation
of
Nrf2
signaling
.
Brain-derived
neurotrophic
factor
(
BDNF
)
signaling
via
TrkB
crucially
regulates
synaptic
plasticity
in
the
brain
.

Although
BDNF
is
abundant
at
hippocampal
mossy
fiber
(
MF
)
synapses
,
which
critically
contribute
to
hippocampus
dependent
memory
,
its
role
in
MF
synaptic
plasticity
(
long-term
potentiation
,
LTP
)
remained
largely
unclear
.

Using
field
potential
recordings
in
CA3
of
adult
heterozygous
BDNF
knockout
(
ko
,
BDNF
+
/
-
)
mice
we
observed
impaired
(
∼50%
)
NMDAR-independent
MF-LTP
.

In
contrast
to
MF
synapses
,
LTP
at
neighboring
associative
/
commissural
(
A
/
C
)
fiber
synapses
remained
unaffected
.

To
exclude
that
impaired
MF-LTP
in
BDNF
+
/
-
mice
was
due
to
developmental
changes
in
response
to
chronically
reduced
BDNF
levels
,
and
to
prove
the
importance
of
acute
availability
of
BDNF
in
MF-LTP
,
we
also
tested
effects
of
acute
interference
with
BDNF
/
TrkB
signaling
.

Inhibition
of
TrkB
tyrosine
kinase
signaling
with
k252a
,
or
with
the
selective
BDNF
scavenger
TrkB-Fc
,
both
inhibited
MF-LTP
to
the
same
extent
as
observed
in
BDNF
+
/
-
mice
.

Basal
synaptic
transmission
,
short-term
plasticity
,
and
synaptic
fatigue
during
LTP
induction
were
not
significantly
altered
by
treatment
with
k252a
or
TrkB-Fc
,
or
by
chronic
BDNF
reduction
in
BDNF
+
/
-
mice
.

Since
the
acute
interference
with
BDNF-signaling
did
not
completely
block
MF-LTP
,
our
results
provide
evidence
that
an
additional
mechanism
besides
BDNF
induced
TrkB
signaling
contributes
to
this
type
of
LTP
.

Our
results
prove
for
the
first
time
a
mechanistic
action
of
acute
BDNF
/
TrkB
signaling
in
presynaptic
expression
of
MF-LTP
in

The
affinities
of

atypical
and

typical
antipsychotic
drugs
for
the
cloned
rat
D4
dopamine
receptor
and
the
D4
/
D2
ratios
were
examined
.

Of
the
atypical
antipsychotic
drugs
tested
,
only
clozapine
,
risperidone
,
olanzapine
,
zotepine
and
tiospirone
had
affinities
less
than
20
nM
.

In
fact
,
many
atypical
antipsychotic
drugs
had
relatively
low
affinities
for
the
cloned
rat
D4
receptor
,
with
Ki
values
greater
than
100
nM
(
Seroquel
,
fluperlapine
,
tenilapine
,
FG5803
and
melperone
)
.

Additionally
,
several
typical
antipsychotic
drugs
had
high
affinities
for
the
cloned
rat
D4
receptor
,
with
Kis
less
than
20
nM
(
loxapine
,
chlorpromazine
,
fluphenazine
,
mesoridazine
,
thioridazine
and
trifluoroperazine
)
.

The
ratios
of
D2
/
D4
affinities
did
not
differentiate
between
these
two
types
of
antipsychotic
drugs
.

Thus
,
D4
dopamine
receptor
affinity
,
used
as
a
single
measure
,
does
not
distinguish
between
the
group
of
typical
and
atypical
antipsychotic
drugs
analyzed

performed
to
gain

alkylides

to
rationalize
the

The
3-O-sidechains
of
19
and

point
to
the
so-called
hydrophilic
side

as
seen

In

the

of
17
and
18
bend
to
the
backside
,
the
so-called
hydrophobic
side
of
the
macrolide
ring

The
results
clearly
indicated
the
alkylides
with
improved
antibacterial
activity
might
possess
a
novel
binding
mode
,
which
is
different
from
clarithromycin
and
the

to
identify
covariates
,
including
genetic
polymorphisms
,
which
affect

and
HCY
PK
parameters
.

METHOD
:
The
study
cohort
comprised
21
patients
undergoing
HSCT
who
received
CY
intravenously
between
2009
and
2011
.

Clinical
characteristics
and
CY
and
HCY
concentration
data
were
collected
for
all
patients
,
and
ABCB1
,
ABCC2
,
GSTA1
,
GSTM1
,
GSTP1
,
GSTT1
,
CYP2B6
,
CYP2C19
,
and
CYP3A5
genotyping
was
performed
.

A
hypothetical
enzyme
compartment
was
conducted
using
the
NONMEM
program
.

RESULTS
:
A
population
PK
analysis
showed
that
the
ABCC2
1249
genotype
and
aspartate
aminotransferase
levels
significantly
affected
non-induced
clearance
(
CL
UI
)
and
induced
clearance
(
CL
I
)
of
CY
,
respectively
.

The
final
estimate
of
the
mean
CL

and
CL
I
of
CY
was
15

683

respectively
,
and
the
mean
volume
of

)
of

was
88
.

The
inter-individual
variability
for
CL

,
CL

,
and
V

of
CY
was
52

and

,
respectively
.

Additionally
,
the
CL
UI
of
CY
was
significantly
decreased
to
approximately
51
%
in
patients
with
the
1249
GA
heterozygous
genotype
compared
to
those
with
the
1249
GG
wild-type
genotype
(

)
.

There
were
only
three
heterozygous
GA
variants
of
ABCC2
1249
in
the
study
patients
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
The
population
PK
model
developed
in
this
study
implies
an
influence
of
genetic
factors
on
the
clearance
of
CY
.

Clearance
was
moderately
reduced
in
patients
with
the
ABCC2
1249GA
heterozygous
genotype

We
have
previously
reported
that
NADPH
oxidase
2
(
Nox2
)
is
up-regulated
in
spinal
cord
microglia
after
spinal
nerve
injury
,
demonstrating
that
it
is
critical
for
microglia
activation
and
subsequent
pain
hypersensitivity
.

However
,
the
mechanisms
and
molecules
involved
in
Nox2
induction
have
not
been
elucidated
.

Previous
studies
have
shown
that
Toll-like
receptors
(
TLRs
)
are
involved
in
nerve
injury-induced
spinal
cord
microglia
activation
.

In
this
study
,
we
investigated
the
role
of
TLR
in
Nox2
expression
in
spinal
cord
microglia
after
peripheral
nerve
injury
.

Studies
using
TLR
knock-out
mice
have
shown
that
nerve
injury-induced
microglial
Nox2
up-regulation
is
abrogated
in
TLR2
but
not
in
TLR3
or
-4
knock-out
mice
.

Intrathecal
injection
of
lipoteichoic
acid
,
a
TLR2
agonist
,
induced
Nox2
expression
in
spinal
cord
microglia
both
at
the
mRNA
and
protein
levels
.

Similarly
,
lipoteichoic
acid
stimulation
induced
Nox2
expression
and
reactive
oxygen
species
production
in
primary
spinal
cord
glial
cells
in
vitro
.

Studies
on
intracellular
signaling
pathways
indicate
that
NF-κB
and
p38
MAP
kinase
activation
is
required
for
TLR2-induced
Nox2
expression
in
glial
cells
.

Conclusively
,
our
data
show
that
TLR2
mediates
nerve
injury-induced
Nox2
gene
expression
in
spinal
cord
microglia
via
NF-κB
and
p38
activation
and
thereby
may
contribute
to
spinal
cord
microglia
activation
.
The
serotonin
(
5-HT
)
receptors
of
type
6
(
5-HT6
)
are
quite
different
from
all
other
5-HT
receptors
,
as
they
include
a
short
third
cytoplasmatic
loop
and
a
long
C-terminal
tail
,
and
one
intron
located
in
the
middle
of
the
third
cytoplasmatic
loop
.

A
lot
of
controversies
still
exist
regarding
their
binding
affinity
,
effects
of
5-HT6
ligands
on
brain
catecholamines
,
behavioral
syndromes
regulated
by
them
,
and
brain
distribution
.

In
spite
of
the
lack
of
information
on
metabolic
pattern
of
the
various
compounds
,
some
of
5-HT6
receptor
ligands
entered
the
clinical
development
as
potential
anti-dementia
,
antipsychotic
,
antidepressant
and
anti-obese
drugs
.

The
present
paper
is
a
comprehensive
review
on
the
state
of
art
of
the
5-HT6
receptors
,
while
highlighting
the
potential
clinical
applications
of
5-HT6
receptor
agonists
/
antagonists
.
Using
radioligand
receptor
binding
methods
,
the
affinities
(
Ki
)
of
amoxapine
and
loxapine
for
various
receptors
(
adrenergic
alpha
1
,
alpha
2
,
beta;
dopaminergic
D1
,
D2;
serotoninergic
5-HT1
,
5-HT2;
Muscarinic
,
GABA
,
BZ
)
were
investigated
.

The
two
compounds
showed
high
affinities
for
5-HT2
,
D2
and
alpha
1
receptors
(
Ki
less
than
10
(
-7
)
mol
/
L
)
,
moderate
affinity
for
alpha
2
receptor
(
Ki
less
than
10
(
-6
)
mol
/
L
)
,
and
low
affinities
for
M
and
5-HT1
receptor
(
Ki
less
than
10
(
-5
)
mol
/
L
)
.

In
addition
,
amoxapine
appeared
to
have
low
affinities
for
D1
and
GABA
receptors
.

For
D1
receptor
,
loxapine
was
found
to
have
moderate
affinity
which
was
nearly
20
fold
greater
than
amoxapine
,
but
amoxapine
exhibited
more
potent
inhibitory
effects
on
serotonin
receptors
and
weaker
inhibitory
affects
on
dopamine
receptors
.

Neither
amoxapine
nor
loxapine
showed
significant
affinity
for
BZ
and
beta-adrenergic
receptors
.

These
differences
in
the
affinities
may
be
responsible
for
their
different
psychopharmacological
effects
in
the
clinical
treatment
of
patients
.

The
regulation
of
5-HT2
and
beta
receptors
were
examined
in
chronic
experiments
on
rats
given
amoxapine
8
mg
/
kg
or
loxapine
1
mg
/
kg
orally
once
daily
for
one
to
three
weeks
.

The
5-HT2
receptor
density
was
time-dependently
reduced
but
no
effect
on
beta
receptors
was
observed
.

The
down-regulation
of
5-HT2
receptors
might
be
associated
with
antidepressant
action
of
the
two
drugs
.
BACKGROUND
:
The
mammalian
target
of
rapamycin
(
mTOR
)
is
a
highly
conserved
serine
/
threonine
kinase
that
controls
cell
growth
and
metabolism
in
response
to
nutrients
,
growth
factors
,
cellular
energy
and
stress
,
and
has
pleiotropic
effects
.

Its
blockade
,
by
mTOR
inhibitors
(
mTOR-Is
)
,
such
as
sirolimus
or
everolimus
,
leads
to
antiproliferative
effects
.

METHODS
:
We
have
reviewed
the
major
studies
that
deal
with
the
utilization
of
mTOR-Is
after
kidney
transplant
and
the
outcomes
.

RESULTS
:
Calcineurin-inhibitor
(
CNI
)
avoidance
,
under
the
umbrella
of
sirolimus-based
immunosuppression
in
de
novo
kidney-transplant
(
KT
)
patients
,
is
associated
with
worse
results
compared
with
those
observed
in
patients
receiving
CNI-based
immunosuppression
.

Conversely
,
using
mTOR-Is
in
the
context
of
CNI
minimization
and
CNI-free
protocols
is
safe
and
efficient
when
used
after
3
months
post-transplant
.

If
cyclosporin
A
(
CsA
)
is
used
in
combination
with
mTOR-I
,
considerable
dose
reduction
of
both
drugs
is
required
.

A
better
choice
may
be
withdrawal
of
CsA
from
this
combination
after
3-12
months
.

Later
withdrawal
or
conversion
to
an
mTOR-I
may
not
be
beneficial
.

Kidney
transplant
recipients
given
mTOR-Is
have
reduced
incidence
of
de
novo
posttransplant
malignancies
.

Posttransplant
Kaposi's
sarcoma
and
nonmelanotic
skin
malignancies
frequently
undergo
remission
/
regression
after
conversion
to
mTOR-I
immunosuppression
.

The
associated
side
effects
of
mTOR-Is
are
numerous
and
may
lead
to
significant
drug
cessation
.

CONCLUSION
:
mTOR-Is
could
be
more
widely
used
in
kidney
transplant
patients
due
to
reduced
nephrotoxicity
and
de
novo
cancer
compared
with
CNIs
.
A
study
on
the
oncolytic
activity
of
the
L-cysteine
derivative
L-cysteine
,
ethyl
ester
,
S-
(
N-methylcarbamate
)
monohydrochloride
(
NSC
303861
)
,
revealed
that
the
drug
caused
complete
regression
of
the
MX-1
human
mammary
tumor
xenograft
.

The
compound
also
exhibited
moderate
antitumor
activity
against
murine
leukemia
P388
(
T
/
C
value
of
169%
at
a
daily
dose
of
400
mg
/
kg
)
and
against
M5076
sarcoma
(
T
/
C
value
of
135%
at
a
daily
dose
of
600
mg
/
kg
)
.

The
drug
was
inactive
against
B16
melanoma
,
Lewis
lung
,
colon
38
and
CD8F1
mammary
carcinomas
.

The
compound
exhibited
significant
cytotoxicity
against
hepatoma
3924A
cells
in
culture
(
LC50
=
6
microM
)
.

Studies
on
the
mechanism
of
action
revealed
that
the
cytotoxicity
of
the
drug
could
be
partially
abrogated
by
protecting
hepatoma
3924A
cells
in
culture
with
L-glutamine
.

At
6
h
after
injection
of
the
compound
(
400
mg
/
kg
)
into
rats
bearing
hepatoma
3924A
,
the
pools
of
L-glutamine
and
L-glutamate
in
the
tumor
decreased
to
33%
and
71%
,
respectively
,
of
control
levels;
the
drug
selectively
inhibited
the
activities
of
L-glutamine-requiring
enzymes
of
purine
nucleotide
biosynthesis
,
amidophosphoribosyltransferase
,
FGAM
synthase
,
and
GMP
synthase
,
to
21%
,
1%
,
and
69%
,
respectively
,
without
significantly
altering
the
activities
of
pyrimidine
biosynthetic
enzymes
,
carbamoylphosphate
synthase
II
and
CTP
synthase
.

Measurement
of
the
nucleotide
concentrations
further
corroborated
the
actions
of
the
drug
on
the
purine
nucleotide
biosynthetic
enzyme
activities
.

Drug
injection
(
400
mg
/
kg
)
in
the
hepatoma
3924A-bearing
rats
reduced
the
concentrations
of
IMP
in
the
tumor
to
52%
,
those
of
total
adenylates
to
52%
,
those
of
total
guanylates
to
57%
,
and
those
of
NAD
to
73%
,
without
significantly
perturbing
the
pyrimidine
nucleotide
pools
.

Studies
on
the
mechanism
of
action
of
the
L-cysteine
derivative
suggested
that
the
compound
behaved
as
an
L-glutamine
antagonist
,
selectively
acting
on
the
enzymes
of
purine
nucleotide
biosynthesis
.

Although
the
liver
is
a
cadmium-target
organ
,
hepatocyte
response
involved
in
its
toxicity
is
not
yet
elucidated
.

A
link
between
this
heavy
metal
treatment
and
Stat3
signaling
pathways
was
examined
in
primary
mouse
hepatocytes
.

We
provided
evidence
of
a
novel
link
among
NADPH
oxidase
and
Stat3
signaling
,
mediated
by
Src
,
EGFR
,
and
Erk1
/
2
.

Cadmium
activates
NADPH
oxidase
.

ROS
produced
by
this
oxidase
activates
Src
,
enable
that
in
turn
,
transactivates
EGFR
that
activates
Stat3
in
tyrosine
,
allowing
its
dimerization
.

Also
,
ROS
from
NADPH
oxidase
favors
ERK1
/
2
activation
that
phosphorylates
Stat3
in
serine
,
resulting
in
a
compensatory
or
adaptive
survival
response
such
as
production
of
metallothionein-II
in
short
Cd
exposure
times
.

However
,
after
12h
CdCl2
treatment
,
cell
viability
diminished
in
50%
,
accompanied
by
a
drastic
decrease
of
metallothionein-II
production
,
and
an
increase
in
p53
activation
and
the
pro-apoptotic
protein
Bax
.
Leflunomide
,
a
novel
drug
with
proven
efficacy
in
rheumatoid
arthritis
,
is
an
isoxazol
derivative
structurally
unrelated
to
other
immunomodulatory
drugs
.

Leflunomide
is
rapidly
metabolized
to
its
active
form
,
A77
1726
.

Two
mechanisms
of
action
have
been
identified
for
A77
1726
:
inhibition
of
dihydroorotate
dehydrogenase
(
DHODH
)
and
inhibition
of
tyrosine
kinases
.

DHODH
inhibition
occurs
at
lower
concentrations
of
A77
1726
than
that
of
tyrosine
kinases
and
is
currently
considered
the
major
mode
of
action
.

Stimulated
lymphocytes
must
increase
ribonucleotide
levels
from
8
to
16-fold
before
proceeding
from
the
G1
into
the
S
phase
.

Increased
levels
of
ribonucleotides
can
only
be
met
by
de
novo
ribonucleotide
synthesis
.

At
low
levels
of
ribonucleotides
,
p53
,
a
"sensor"
molecule
,
gets
activated
and
prevents
progression
through
the
cell
cycle
.

Therefore
,
an
inhibitor
of
de
novo
uridine
monophosphate
synthesis
would
predictably
arrest
stimulated
cells
at
the
G1
phase
.

In
support
of
this
mechanism
of
action
,
in
vitro
mitogen
stimulated
human
peripheral
blood
lymphocytes
treated
with
A77
1726
undergo
arrest
at
the
G1
phase;
this
inhibition
is
reversed
by
uridine
.
Both
the
sulfide
and
sulfone
metabolites
of
sulindac
,
a
nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory
drug
,
display
anticarcinogenic
effects
in
experimental
models
.

Sulindac
sulfide
inhibits
cyclooxygenase
(
COX
)
enzyme
activities
and
has
been
reported
to
suppress
ras-dependent
signaling
.

However
,
the
mechanisms
by
which
sulindac
sulfone
suppresses
cancer
growth
are
not
as
defined
.

We
studied
the
effects
of
these
sulindac
metabolites
in
human
colon
cancer-derived
Caco-2
cells
that
have
been
transfected
with
an
activated
K-ras
oncogene
.

Stable
transfected
clones
expressed
high
levels
of
COX-2
mRNA
and
protein
,
compared
with
parental
cells
.

K-ras-transfected
cells
formed
tumors
more
quickly
when
injected
into
severe
combined
immunodeficiency
disease
mice
than
parental
cells
,
and
this
tumorigenesis
was
suppressed
by
treatment
with
sulindac
.

Sulindac
sulfone
inhibited
COX-2
protein
expression
,
which
resulted
in
a
decrease
in
prostaglandin
synthase
E2
production
.

Sulindac
sulfide
had
little
effect
on
COX-2
in
this
model
,
but
did
suppress
prostaglandin
synthase
E2
production
,
presumably
by
inhibiting
COX
enzyme
activity
.

These
data
indicate
that
the
sulfide
and
sulfone
derivatives
of
sulindac
exert
COX-dependent
effects
by
distinct
mechanisms
.

At

BMS-763534

the

showed

B3LYP
have
been
performed
to
study
the
methyl

step
in

N-methyltransferase
(

)
.

This
enzyme
catalyzes
the
S-adenosyl-L-methionine
(
SAM
)
-dependent
methylation
of
glycine
to
form
sarcosine
.

The
starting
point
for
the
calculations
is
the
recent
X-ray
crystal
structure
of
GNMT
complexed
with
SAM
and
acetate
.

Several
quantum
chemical
models
with
different
sizes
,
employing
up
to
98
atoms
,
were
used
.

The
calculations
demonstrate
that
the

mechanism
,
where
the
methyl
group
is
transferred
in
a
single
S
(

,
is

.

By
adding

groups
at

,
it
was
furthermore
demonstrated
that
hydrogen
bonds
to
the
amino

the

Moclobemide
rather
selectively
inhibited
MAO-A
.

Its
inhibitory
potency
is
rather
low
,
like
that
of
toloxatone
,
whereas
clorgyline
,
harmaline
,
cimoxatone
and
brofaromine
were
all
found
to
be
at
least
100
times
more
potent
.

Phenelzine
,
isocarboxazid
and
tranylcypromine
were
nonspecific
,
inhibiting
MAO-A
and
MAO-B
to
about
the
same
extent
.

The
same
drugs
were
also
tested
ex
vivo
.

Here
again
moclobemide
preferentially
inhibited
MAO-A;
it
was
equipotent
to
clorgyline
and
brofaromine
in
these
tests
,
and
2-4
times
as
potent
as
cimoxatone
and
harmaline
.

Moclobemide
is
a
relatively
weak
MAO-A
inhibitor
in
vitro
and
yet
more
potent
in
vivo
than
other
reversible
inhibitors
,
suggesting
that
the
compound
may
be
converted
in
vivo
to
an
active
form
.

Nevertheless
,
it
has
not
been
possible
so
far
to
identify
activated
derivatives
,
and
recent
findings
that
moclobemide
markedly
inhibits
liver
MAO-A
within
5
min
of
an
intravenous
injection
strongly
suggests
that
the
compound
itself
is
responsible

the

Cyclooxygenase
(
COX
)
-2-derived
prostanoids
can
influence
several
processes
that
are
linked
to
carcinogenesis
.

We
aimed
to
address
the
hypothesis
that
platelets
contribute
to
aberrant
COX-2
expression
in
HT29
colon
carcinoma
cells
and
to
reveal
the
role
of
platelet-induced
COX-2
on
the
expression
of
proteins
involved
in
malignancy
and
marker
genes
of
epithelial-mesenchymal
transition
(
EMT
)
.

Human
platelets
co-cultured
with
HT29
cells
rapidly
adhered
to
cancer
cells
and
induced
COX-2
mRNA
expression
,
but
not
protein
synthesis
which
required
the
late
release
of
platelet
PDGF
and
COX-2
mRNA
stabilization
.

Platelet-induced
COX-2-dependent
PGE2
synthesis
in
HT29
cells
was
involved
in
downregulation
of
p21
(
WAF1
/
CIP1
)
and
upregulation
of
cyclinB1
,
since
these
effects
were
prevented
by
rofecoxib
(
a
selective
COX-2
inhibitor
)
and
rescued
by
exogenous
PGE2
.

Galectin-3
,
highly
expressed
in
HT29
cells
,
is
unique
among
galectins
because
it
contains
a
collagen-like
domain
.

Thus
,
we
studied
the
role
of
galectin-3
and
platelet
collagen
receptors
in
platelet-induced
COX-2
overexpression
.

Inhibitors
of
galectin-3
function
(
β-lactose
,
a
dominant-negative
form
of
galectin-3
,
Gal-3C
,
and
anti-galectin-3
antibody
M3
/
38
)
or
collagen
receptor-mediated
platelet
adhesion
(
revacept
,
a
dimeric
collagen
receptor
GPVI-Fc
)
prevented
aberrant
COX-2
expression
.

Inhibition
of
platelet-cancer
cell
interaction
by
revacept
was
more
effective
than
rofecoxib
in
preventing
platelet-induced
mRNA
changes
of
EMT
markers
suggesting
that
direct
cell-cell
contact
and
aberrant
COX-2
expression
synergistically
induced
gene
expression
modifications
associated
with
EMT
.

In
conclusion
,
our
findings
provide
the
rationale
for
testing
blockers
of
collagen
binding
sites
,
such
as
revacept
,
and
galectin-3
inhibitors
in
the
prevention
of
colon
cancer
metastasis
in
animal
models
followed
by
studies
in

Previous
reports
have
identified
a
role
for
the
tyrosine
kinase
receptor
EphB4
and
its
ligand
,
ephrinB2
,
as
potential
mediators
of
both
bone
formation
by
osteoblasts
and
bone
resorption
by
osteoclasts
.

In
the
present
study
,
we
examined
the
role
of
EphB4
during
bone
repair
after
traumatic
injury
.

We
performed
femoral
fractures
with
internal
fixation
in
transgenic
mice
that
overexpress
EphB4
under
the
collagen
type
1
promoter
(
Col1-EphB4
)
and
investigated
the
bone
repair
process
up
to
12
weeks
postfracture
.

The
data
indicated
that
Col1-EphB4
mice
exhibited
stiffer
and
stronger
bones
after
fracture
compared
with
wild-type
mice
.

The
fractured
bones
of
Col1-EphB4
transgenic
mice
displayed
significantly
greater
tissue
and
bone
volume
2
weeks
postfracture
compared
with
that
of
wild-type
mice
.

These
findings
correlated
with
increased
chondrogenesis
and
mineral
formation
within
the
callus
site
at
2
weeks
postfracture
,
as
demonstrated
by
increased
safranin
O
and
von
Kossa
staining
,
respectively
.

Interestingly
,
Col1-EphB4
mice
were
found
to
possess
significantly
greater
numbers
of
clonogenic
mesenchymal
stromal
progenitor
cells
(
CFU-F
)
,
with
an
increased
capacity
to
form
mineralized
nodules
in
vitro
under
osteogenic
conditions
,
when
compared
with
those
of
the
wild-type
control
mice
.

Furthermore
,
Col1-EphB4
mice
had
significantly
lower
numbers
of
TRAP-positive
multinucleated
osteoclasts
within
the
callus
site
.

Taken
together
,
these
observations
suggest
that
EphB4
promotes
endochondral
ossification
while
inhibiting
osteoclast
development
during
callus
formation
and
may
represent
a
novel
drug
target
for
the
repair
of
fractured
bones
.

A

of
the
muscarinic

diphenidol
bearing

,
and
steric
properties
was
synthesized
and
their
affinity
for
the
M2

muscarinic

subtypes
was
evaluated
by
functional
tests
.

Two
derivatives
(

2d
)
showed
an
M2-selective
profile
which
was
confirmed
by
functional
tests
on
the

M4
receptors
.

A
possible
relationship
between
M2
selectivity
and
lipophilicity
of
the
1-substituent
was
suggested
by
structure-activity
analysis
.

This
work
showed
that
appropriate

can
lead
to

Cultures
of

cerebellum
from
7-day-old
mice
were
used
to
investigate
the
mechanism
involved
in
synthesis
and
cellular
redistribution
of
GABA
in
these
cultures
consisting
primarily
of
glutamatergic
granule
neurons
and
a
smaller
population
of
GABAergic
Golgi
and
stellate
neurons
.

The
distribution
of
GAD
,
GABA
and
the
vesicular
glutamate
transporter
VGlut-1
was
assessed
using
specific
antibodies
combined
with
immunofluorescence
microscopy
.

Additionally
,
tiagabine
,
SKF
89976-A
,
betaine
,
beta-alanine
,
nipecotic
acid
and
guvacine
were
used
to
inhibit
the
GAT1
,
betaine
/
GABA
(
BGT1
)
,
GAT2
and
GAT3
transporters
.

Only
a
small
population
of
cells
were
immuno-stained
for
GAD
while
many
cells
exhibited
VGlut-1
like
immuno-reactivity
which
,
however
,
never
co-localized
with
GAD
positive
neurons
.

This
likely
reflects
the
small
number
of
GABAergic
neurons
compared
to
the
glutamatergic
granule
neurons
constituting
the
majority
of
the
cells
.

GABA
uptake
exhibited
the
kinetics
of
high
affinity
transport
and
could
be
partly
(
20%
)
inhibited
by
betaine
(
IC
(
50
)
142
microM
)
,
beta-alanine
(
30%
)
and
almost

)
inhibited

microM
)
or
nipecotic
acid
and
guvacine
at
1
mM
concentrations
(
95%
)
.

Essentially
all
neurons
showed
GABA
like
immunostaining
albeit
with
differences
in
intensity
.

The
results
indicate
that
GABA
which
is
synthesized
in
a
small
population
of
GAD-positive
neurons
is
redistributed
to
essentially
all
neurons
including
the
glutamatergic
granule
cells
.

GAT1
is
not
likely
involved
in
this
redistribution
since
addition
of
15
microM
tiagabine
(
GAT1
inhibitor
)
to
the
culture
medium
had
no
effect
on
the
overall
GABA
content
of
the
cells
.

Likewise
the
BGT1
transporter
cannot
alone
account
for
the
redistribution
since
inclusion
of
3
mM
betaine
in
the
culture
medium
had
no
effect
on
the
overall
GABA
content
.

The
inhibitory
action
of
beta-alanine
and
high
concentrations
of
nipecotic
acid
and
guvacine
on
GABA
transport
strongly
suggests
that
also
GAT2
or
GAT3
(
HUGO
nomenclature
)
could
play
a
role
.
The
homomeric
α7
nicotinic
acetylcholine
receptor
is
a
well-studied
therapeutic
target
,
though
its
characteristically
rapid
desensitization
complicates
the
development
of
drugs
with
specific
agonist
effects
.

Moreover
,
some
experimental
compounds
such
as
GTS-21
(
2
,
4diMeOBA
)
,
a
derivative
of
the
α7-selective
partial
agonist
benzylidene
anabaseine
(
BA
)
,
produce
a
prolonged
residual
desensitization
(
RD
)
in
which
the
receptor
remains
non-activatable
long
after
the
drug
has
been
removed
from
extracellular
solution
.

In
contrast
,
the
desensitization
caused
by
GTS-21's
dihydroxy
metabolite
(
2
,
4diOHBA
)
is
relatively
short-lived
.

RD
is
hypothetically
due
to
stable
binding
of
the
ligand
to
the
receptor
in
its
desensitized
state
.

We
can
attribute
the
reduction
in
RD
to
a
single
BA
hydroxyl
group
on
the
4'
benzylidene
position
.

Computational
prediction
derived
from
homology
modeling
showed
the
serine36
(
S36
)
residue
of
α7
as
a
reasonable
candidate
for
point-to-point
interaction
between
BA
compounds
and
the
receptor
.

Through
evaluating
the
activity
of
BA
and
simple
derivatives
on
wild-type
and
mutant
α7
receptors
,
it
was
observed
that
the
drug-receptor
pairs
which
were
capable
of
hydrogen
bonding
at
residue
36
exhibited
significantly
less
stable
desensitization
.

Further
experiments
involving
the
type
II
positive
allosteric
modulator
(
PAM
)
PNU-120596
showed
that
the
various
BA
compounds'
preference
to
induce
either
a
PAM-sensitive
(
D
(
s
)
)
or
PAM-insensitive
(
D
(
i
)
)
desensitized
state
is
concentration
dependent
and
suggested
that
both
states
are
destabilized
by
S36
H-bonding
.

These
results
indicate
that
the
fine-tuning
of
agonists
for
specific
interaction
with
S36
can
facilitate
the
development
of
therapeutics
with
targeted
effects
on
ion
channel

properties
and

state
stability

The

inhibitor
led
to
a

of

transcription
.

The
COX-2
inhibitor
led
to
a
complete
blockade
of

secretion
and

transcription
but
had
no
effect
on
corticosterone
secretion
.

The

had
no

These
results
demonstrate
the
crucial
role
of
eicosanoid
pathways
in
mediating
the
stimulation
of
the
HPA
axis
induced
by
IL-1beta

Moreover

we
found
a
clear
dissociation
of
the
effect
of
the
blockage
of
COXs
upon
ACTH
and
corticosterone
secretion

suggesting
that
IL-1beta
may
act

well
as
at

adrenal
cortex

stimulate
the
secretion

proliferation
.

Platelet-derived

attenuated
by
lowering

)
and
was
enhanced
by
elevating

RATIONALE
:
d-Fenfluramine
stimulates
the
release
of
serotonin
(
5-HT
)
and
is
a
potent
inhibitor
of
the
re-uptake
of
5-HT
into
nerve
terminals
.

Administration
of
d-fenfluramine
suppresses
food
intake
in
both
animals
and
humans
.

OBJECTIVE
:
We
have
investigated
the
role
of
the
5-HT2C
receptor
in
mediating
the
effect
of
d-fenfluramine
on
mouse
food
intake
and
the
behavioural
satiety
sequence
.

METHODS
:
Mutant
mice
lacking
serotonin
5-HT2C
receptors
and
wild-type
animals
were
habituated
to
a
daily
presentation
of
wet
mash
.

Animals
were
non-deprived
and
received
d-fenfluramine
(
3-30
mg
/
kg
)
30
min
prior
to
being
assessed
for
the
presence
of
stereotypy
and
presented
with
wet
mash
.

The
behaviour
of
animals
was
observed
for
the
subsequent
40
min
and
food
intake
was
recorded
.

RESULTS
:
d-Fenfluramine
dose-dependently
inhibited
the
consumption
of
a
palatable
wet
mash
by
the
mice
.

d-Fenfluramine
(
3
mg
/
kg
)
significantly
reduced
the
amount
of
wet
mash
consumed
by
wild-type
mice
and
induced
a
temporal
advance
in
the
behavioural
satiety
sequence
consistent
with
an
enhancement
of
satiety
.

Mutant
mice
were
less
sensitive
to
the
satiating
effects
of
3
mg
/
kg
d-fenfluramine
.

Hence
,
this
dose
of
d-fenfluramine
had
a
reduced
effect
on
both
food
consumption
and
the
behavioural
satiety
sequence
in
the
5-HT2C
mutant
mice
.

In
contrast
,
mutant
mice
showed
an
increased
sensitivity
to
the
stereotypy
induced
by
high
doses
of
d-fenfluramine
(
10
,
30
mg
/
kg
)
compared
to
that
of
wild-type
littermates
.

CONCLUSION
:
These
data
demonstrate
a
role
for
the
5-HT2C
receptor
in
mediating
d-fenfluramine-induced
satiety
.
Aldosterone
induces
elastin
production
in
cardiac
fibroblasts
through
activation
of
insulin-like
growth
factor-I
receptors
in
a
mineralocorticoid
receptor-independent
manner
.
OBJECTIVES
:
In
this
study
,
we
investigated
the
crosstalk
of
endothelin-1
(
ET-1
)
and
platelet-derived
growth
factor
(
PDGF
)
in
coronary
artery
smooth
muscle
cell
(
SMC
)
proliferation
in
the
rat
cardiac
allograft
model
.

BACKGROUND
:
Previous
studies
have
suggested
an
independent
role
of
ET-1
and
PDGF
in
the
development
of
cardiac
allograft
arteriosclerosis
(
i
.

e
.

,
chronic
rejection
)
.

METHODS
:
Heterotopic
heart
transplantations
were
performed
from
Dark
Agouti
to
Wistar
Furth
rats
.

Grafts
were
harvested
after
five
days
in
an
acute
rejection
model
and
after
60
days
in
a
chronic
rejection
model
.

In
the
in
vitro
part
of
the
study
,
SMC
proliferation
and
migration
were
quantitated
,
as
well
as
messenger
ribonucleic
acid
(
mRNA
)
levels
of
ET-1
and
PDGF
ligands
and
receptors
after
growth
factor
stimulation
.

RESULTS
:
Acute
rejection
induced
both
ET-1
receptors
in
the
arterial
wall
.

On
linear
regression
analysis
of
chronically
rejecting
cardiac
allografts
,
a
strong
correlation
between
intimal
thickening
and
immunoreactivity
of
ET-1
and
ET
receptors
A
and
B
(
ET
(
A
)
and
ET
(
B
)
)
in
the
arterial
walls
was
observed
.

Treatment
with
Bosentan
,
a
mixed
ET-1
receptor
antagonist
,
significantly
reduced
the
incidence
and
intensity
of
arteriosclerotic
lesions
in
rat
cardiac
allografts
,
as
well
as
total
intragraft
ET
(
A
)
and
ET
(
B
)
mRNA
expression
and
intimal
cell
ET-1
and
receptor
immunoreactivity
.

This
was
associated
with
significantly
reduced
intragraft
PDGF
beta-receptor
(
PDGF-Rbeta
)
mRNA
expression
.

In
contrast
,
CGP
53716
,
a
protein
tyrosine
kinase
inhibitor
selective
for
the
PDGF
receptor
,
did
not
reduce
intragraft
ET-1
,
ET
(
A
)
or
ET
(
B
)
mRNA
expression
.

In
rat
coronary
artery
SMC
cultures
,
ET-1
stimulation
significantly
upregulated
PDGF-Ralpha
and
-Rbeta
mRNA
expression
and
augmented
PDGF-BB-mediated
SMC
proliferation
as
well
as
PDGF-AB-
and
PDGF-BB-mediated
SMC
migration
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
Our
results
suggest
that
the
ET-1
/
PDGF-Rbeta
/
PDGF-BB
axis
may
operate
in
SMC
migration
and
proliferation
in
cardiac
allograft
arteriosclerosis
,
thus
explaining
the
marked
beneficial
effects
of
blocking
the
signaling
downstream
of
ET-1
receptors

Molecular
mechanisms
concerning
the

stress
,

by
a
grape
seed
extract
,
Burgund
Mare
variety
(
BM
)
,
in
SKH-1
mice
exposed
to
UVB
,
were
investigated
.

The
animals
were
irradiated
with
single
and
multiple
doses
of
UVB
in
10
consecutive
days
.

In
each
experiment
were
used
five
groups
of
animals
:
control
,
vehicle
,
UVB
irradiated
,
vehicle
+
UVB
,
BM
+
UVB
.

The
extract
was
applied
topically
,
30min
before
each
UVB
exposure
,
in
a
dose
of
4mg
total
polyphenols
/
cm
(
2
)
.

BM
remarkably
inhibited
UVB-induced
activation
of
inducible
nitric
oxide
synthase
(
iNOS
)
and
therefore
generation
of
nitric
oxide
(
NO
)
and
nitrotyrosine
,
in
a
UVB
single
dose
regimen
.

BM
also
suppressed
NF-kB
activation
by
UVB
but
did
not
affect
the
activity
of
total
ERK
1
/
2
.

In
multiple
UVB
irradiations
,
BM
increased
NO
formation
and
total
ERK
1
/
2
activity
and
reduced
iNOS
activity
and
nitrotyrosine
levels
,
inhibited
cell
proliferation
,
diminished
p53
and
caspase-3
immunoreactivities
and
increased
the
percentage
of
Bcl-2
positive
cells
.

We
concluded
that
BM
modulates
the
apoptotic
response
of
SKH-1
mice
skin
in
UVB
irradiation
by
the
inhibition
of
p53
,
caspase-3
,
Bax
/
Bcl-2
and
proliferating
cell
nuclear
antigen
expressions
,
as
well
as
by
reducing
the
activation
of
iNOS
and
NF-kB
.
BACKGROUND
&
AIMS
:
The
pathogenesis
of
nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory
drug-induced
enteropathy
is
controversial
,
but
it
is
thought
that
cyclooxygenase-1
(
COX-1
)
inhibition
is
of
pivotal
importance
.

We
compared
small
intestinal
function
and
morphology
in
untreated
wild-type
,
COX-1-
and
COX-2-deficient
mice
and
the
effect
of
indomethacin
,
selective
COX-1
(
SC-560
)
,
and
COX-2
(
celecoxib
)
inhibition
.

METHODS
:
Intestinal
permeability
(
(
51
)
CrEDTA
)
,
inflammation
(
fecal
granulocyte
marker
protein
)
,
prostaglandin
E
(
2
)
(
PGE
(
2
)
)
levels
,
and
macroscopic
and
microscopic
appearances
were
assessed
at
baseline
and
after
the
drugs
.

RESULTS
:
COX-1
(
-
/
-
)
animals
were
normal
except
for
a
97%
decrease
in
intestinal
PGE
(
2
)
levels
.

COX-1
(
+
/
+
)
and
COX-1
(
-
/
-
)
animals
reacted
in
a
similar
way
to
indomethacin
.

However
,
celecoxib
,
having
caused
no
damage
in
COX-1
(
+
/
+
)
animals
,
caused
small
bowel
ulcers
in
COX-1
(
-
/
-
)
animals
.

Selective
inhibition
of
COX-1
decreased
intestinal
PGE
(
2
)
levels
in
COX-2
(
+
/
+
)
and
COX-2
(
-
/
-
)
animals
by
95%-97%
,
but
caused
only
small
bowel
ulcers
in
the
latter
group
.

Dual
inhibition
of
COX-1
and
COX-2
in
wild-type
animals
resulted
in
similar
small
bowel
damage
.

Between
40%
and
50%
of
untreated
COX-2
(
-
/
-
)
animals
had
increased
intestinal
permeability
and
inflammation
.

Some
had
ileal
ulcers
that
were
distinctively
different
from
indomethacin-induced
ulcers
.

Furthermore
,
long-term
celecoxib
administration
in
wild-type
animals
was
associated
with
similar
damage
as
in
the
COX-2
(
-
/
-
)
mice
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
COX-1
deficiency
or
inhibition
and
short-term
COX-2
inhibition
are
compatible
with
normal
small
intestinal
integrity
.

Dual
inhibition
of
the
COX
enzymes
leads
to
damage
similar
to
that
seen
with
indomethacin
.

Long-term
COX-2
deficiency
or
inhibition
is
associated
with
significant
intestinal
pathology
despite
normal
intestinal
PGE
(
2
)
levels
,
suggesting
a
role
for
COX-2
in
the
maintenance
of
small
intestinal
integrity
in
the
mouse
.

Pharmacologic
stress
testing
uses
vasodilators
to
provide
objective
evidence
of
myocardial
ischemia
.

Adenosine
and
dipyridamole
are
nonselective
adenosine
receptor
agonists
that
have
been
associated
with
myocardial
infarction
(
MI
)
during
intravenous
infusion
.

Mechanisms
postulated
for
this
effect
include
coronary
steal
,
transmural
steal
,
global
hypotension
,
and
direct
vasoconstriction
.

Regadenoson
,
a
direct
A2A
agonist
,
was
approved
for
use
in
stress
testing
in
2008
.

We
describe
a
68-year-old
man
who
presented
to
our
institution
with
typical
angina
,
relieved
by
nitroglycerin
.

He
did
not
have
electrocardiogram
(
ECG
)
changes
suggestive
of
myocardial
pathology
,
and
laboratory
testing
did
not
reveal
a
significant
rise
in
troponin-I
levels
.

To
further
assess
the
etiology
of
his
symptoms
,
he
underwent
a
pharmacologic
stress
test
with
regadenoson
followed
by
technetium
99
m
sestamibi
.

Six
minutes
after
regadenoson
infusion
,
the
patient
developed
severe
retrosternal
chest
pain
accompanied
by
ST
elevations
on
ECG
.

Sublingual
nitroglycerin
was
administered
that
resolved
both
the
pain
and
ECG
changes
.

The
patient
subsequently
underwent
urgent
coronary
angiography
and
was
found
to
have
a
95%
critical
stenosis
involving
the
left
anterior
descending
artery
.

We
conclude
this
case
represents
a
MI
secondary
to
coronary
steal
phenomenon
induced
by
regadenoson
infusion
.

Clinicians
should
be
aware
this
adverse
effect
can
occur
despite
the
improved
side-effect
profile
of
regadenoson
.

Continuous
monitoring
of
vital
signs
and
the
ECG
with
regular
assessment
of
symptoms
is
imperative
to
identify
this
rare
but
potentially
devastating
adverse
event
.

Sulfur

)
is
a
vesicant
chemical

and

agent
.

Besides
skin
and
eye
injury
,
respiratory
damage
has
been
mainly
responsible
for
morbidity
and
mortality
after
SM
exposure
.

Previously
,
it
was
shown
that
suppressing
the
death
receptor
(
DR
)
response
by
the
dominant-negative
Fas-associated
death
domain
protein
prior
to
SM
exposure
blocked
apoptosis
and
microvesication
in
skin
.

Here
,
we
studied
whether
antagonizing
the
Fas
receptor
(
FasR
)
pathway
by
small-interfering
RNA
(
siRNA
)
applied
after
SM
exposure
would
prevent
apoptosis
and
,
thus
,
airway
injury
.

Normal
human
bronchial
/
tracheal
epithelial
(
NHBE
)
cells
were
used
as
an
in
vitro
model
with
FasR
siRNA
,
FasR
agonistic
antibody
CH11
,
and
FasR
antagonistic
antibody
ZB4
as
investigative
tools
.

In
NHBE
cells
,
both
SM
(
300
µM
)
and
CH11
(
100
ng
/
ml
)
induced
caspase-3
activation
,
which
was
inhibited
by
FasR
siRNA
and
ZB4
,
indicating
that
SM-induced
apoptosis
was
via
the
Fas
response
.

FasR
siRNA
inhibited
SM-induced
caspase-3
activation
when
added
to
NHBE
cultures
up
to
8
hours
after
SM
.

Results
using
annexin
V
/
propidium
iodide-stained
cells
showed
that
both
apoptosis
and
necrosis
were
involved
in
cell
death
due
to
SM;
FasR
siRNA
decreased
both
apoptotic
and
necrotic
cell
populations
.

Bronchoalveolar
lavage
fluid
(
BALF
)
of
rats
exposed
to
SM
(
1
mg
/
kg
,
50
minutes
)
revealed
a
significant
(
P
<
0
.
05
)
increase
in
soluble
Fas
ligand
and
active
caspase-3
in
BALF
cells
.

These
findings
suggest
an
intervention
of
Fas-mediated
apoptosis
as
a
postexposure
therapeutic
strategy
with
a
therapeutic
window
for
SM
inhalation
injury
and
possibly
other
respiratory
diseases
involving
the
Fas

Estramustine
is
a
novel
anti-microtubule
drug
shown
to
bind
MAP-1
and
MAP-2
(
microtubule-associated
proteins
)
in
vitro
.

In
this
paper
we
have
shown
that
estramustine
specifically
binds
MAP-1A
in
Du
145a
cells
,
resulting
in
disruption
of
MAP-1A
microtubules
and
inhibition
of
type
IV
collagenase
secretion
.

Immunofluorescence
studies
revealed
that
at
30
microM
levels
estramustine
blocked
type
IV
collagenase
secretion
by
partial
disruption
of
the
MAP-1A
microtubule
networks
.

Immunoprecipitation
studies
with
polyclonal
antibodies
provided
quantitative
evidence
that
30-60
microM
estramustine
blocked
secretion
of
a
105
x
10
(
3
)
Mr
type
IV
collagenase
.

Pulse-labeling
experiments
confirmed
that
the
effect
was
not
a
result
of
inhibition
of
either
protein
synthesis
or
altered
rates
of
type
IV
collagenase
turnover
.

Finally
,
drug
uptake
studies
with
[
3H
]
estramustine
,
scintillation
counting
and
fluorography
demonstrated
that
the
principal
target
of
the
drug
was
MAP-1A
.

For
the
first
time
we
have
shown
that
the
drug
blocks
secretion
by
binding
MAP-1A
and
causing
incomplete
disruption
of
the
microtubule
networks
.

Checkpoint
kinase
1
(
Chk1
)
inhibitors
are
being
trialled
for
their
efficacy
in
enhancing
conventional
chemotherapeutic
agents
,
but
their
effectiveness
as
single
agents
is
not
known
.

We
have
examined
the
effectiveness
of
two
novel
Chk1
selective
inhibitors
,
AR323
and
AR678
,
in
a
panel
of
melanoma
cell
lines
and
normal
cell
types
.

We
demonstrate
that
these
drugs
display
single-agent
activity
,
with
IC50s
in
the
low
nanomolar
range
.

The
drugs
produce
cytotoxic
effects
in
cell
lines
that
are
most
sensitive
to
these
drugs
,
whereas
normal
cells
are
only
sensitive
to
these
drugs
at
the
higher
concentrations
where
they
have
cytostatic
activity
.

The
cytotoxic
effect
is
the
consequence
of
inhibition
of
S-phase
Chk1
,
which
drives
cells
prematurely
from
late
S
phase
into
an
aberrant
mitosis
and
results
in
either
failure
of
cytokinesis
or
cell
death
through
an
apoptotic
mechanism
.

The
sensitivity
to
the
Chk1
inhibitors
was
correlated
with
the
level
of
endogenous
DNA
damage
indicating
replicative
stress
.

Chk1
inhibitors
are
viable
single-agent
therapies
that
target
melanoma
cells
with
high
levels
of
endogenous
DNA
damage
.

This
sensitivity
suggests
that
Chk1
is
a
critical
component
of
an
adaptation
to
replicative
stress
in
these
cells
.

It
also
suggests
that
markers
of
DNA
damage
may
be
useful
in
identifying
the
melanomas
and
potentially
other
tumour
types
that
are
more
likely
to
be
sensitive
to
Chk1
inhibitors
as
single
agents
.

Alcohol
dehydrogenase
5
(
ADH5
)
is
a
member
of
the
mammalian
alcohol
dehydrogenase
family
of
yet
undefined
functions
.

ADH5
was
first
identified
at
the
DNA
level
in
human
and
deer
mouse
.

A
rat
alcohol
dehydrogenase
structure
of
similar
type
has
been
isolated
at
the
cDNA
level
using
human
ADH5
as
a
screening
probe
,
where
the
rat
cDNA
structure
displayed
several
atypical
properties
.

mRNA
for
rat
ADH5
was
found
in
multiple
tissues
,
especially
in
the
kidney
.

In
vitro
translation
experiments
indicated
that
rat
ADH5
is
expressed
as
efficiently
as
ADH1
and
furthermore
,
rat
ADH5
was
readily
expressed
in
COS
cells
fused
to
Green
Fluorescent
Protein
.

However
,
no
soluble
ADH5
protein
could
be
heterologously
expressed
in
Escherichia
coli
cells
with
expression
systems
successfully
used
for
other
mammalian
ADHs
,
including
fused
to
glutathione-S-transferase
.

Molecular
modelling
of
the
enzyme
indicated
that
the
protein
does
not
fold
in
a
productive
way
,
which
can
be
the
explanation
why
no
stable
and
active
ADH5
has
been
isolated
.

These
results
indicate
that
ADH5
,
while
readily
expressed
at
the
mRNA
level
,
does
not
behave
similarly
to
other
mammalian
ADHs
investigated
.

The
results
,
in
vitro
and
in
silico
,
suggest
an
unstable
ADH5
structure
,
which
can
explain
for
why
no
active
and
stable
protein
can
be
isolated
.

Further
possibilities
are
conceivable
:
the
ADH5
protein
may
have
to
interact
with
a
stabiliser
,
or
the
gene
is
actually
a
pseudogene
.

Fibrates
and
thiazolidinediones
are
used
clinically
to
treat
hypertriglyceridemia
and
hyperglycemia
,
respectively
.

Fibrates
bind
to
the
peroxisome
proliferator-activated
receptor
(
PPAR
)
-alpha
,
and
thiazolidinediones
are
ligands
of
PPAR-gamma
.

These
intracellular
receptors
form
heterodimers
with
retinoid
X
receptor
to
modulate
gene
transcription
.

To
elucidate
the
target
genes
regulated
by
these
compounds
,
we
treated
Zucker
diabetic
fatty
rats
(
ZDF
)
for
15
days
with
a
PPAR-alpha-specific
compound
,
fenofibrate
,
a
PPAR-gamma-specific
ligand
,
rosiglitazone
,
and
a
PPAR-alpha
/
-gamma
coagonist
,
GW2331
,
and
measured
the
levels
of
several
messenger
RNAs
(
mRNAs
)
in
liver
by
real-time
polymerase
chain
reaction
.

All
3
compounds
decreased
serum
glucose
and
triglyceride
levels
.

Fenofibrate
and
GW2331
induced
expression
of
acyl-coenzyme
A
(
CoA
)
oxidase
and
enoyl-CoA
hydratase
and
reduced
apolipoprotein
C-III
and
phosphoenolpyruvate
carboxykinase
mRNAs
.

Rosiglitazone
modestly
increased
apolipoprotein
C-III
mRNA
and
had
no
effect
on
expression
of
the
other
2
genes
in
the
liver
but
increased
the
expression
of
glucose
transporter
4
and
phosphoenolpyruvate
carboxykinase
in
adipose
tissue
.

We
identified
a
novel
target
in
liver
,
mitogen-activated
phosphokinase
phosphatase
1
,
whose
down-regulation
by
PPAR-alpha
agonists
may
improve
insulin
sensitivity
in
that
tissue
by
prolonging
insulin
responses
.

The
results
of
these
studies
suggest
that
activation
of
PPAR-alpha
as
well
as
PPAR-gamma
in
therapy
for
type
2
diabetes
will
enhance
glucose
and
triglyceride
control
by
combining
actions
in
hepatic
and
peripheral
tissues
.
The
present
paper
features
an
exciting
time
in
the
late
1980s
when
I
,
as
a
visiting
scientist
,
had
the
privilege
to
participate
in
the
early
and
very
exciting
development
of

in
Professor
Adam
Heller's
laboratory
at
the
Department
of
Chemical
Engineering
at
University
of
Texas
at
Austin
.

This

is
followed
by
an
overview
of
the
research
my
visit
initiated
at
Uppsala
University
.

In
collaboration
with
Swedish
colleagues
,
we

Functional

)
leads
to
hypophosphatasia
,
characterized
by
rickets
/
osteomalacia
attributable
to
elevated
levels
of
extracellular
inorganic
pyrophosphate
,
a
potent
mineralization
inhibitor
.

Osteopontin
(
OPN
)
is
also
elevated
in
the
plasma
and
skeleton
of
Alpl
(

)
mice
.

Phosphorylated
OPN
is
known
to
inhibit
mineralization
,
however
,
the
phosphorylation
status
of
the
increased
OPN
found
in
Alpl
(
-

)
mice
is
unknown
.

Here
,
we
generated
a
transgenic
mouse
line
expressing
human
TNAP
under
control
of
an
osteoblast-specific
Col1a1
promoter
(
Col1a1-Tnap
)
.

The
transgene
is
expressed
in
osteoblasts
,
periosteum
,
and
cortical
bones
,
and
plasma
levels
of
TNAP
in
mice
expressing
Col1a1-Tnap
are
10-20
times
higher
than
those
of
wild-type
mice
.

The
Col1a1-Tnap
animals
are
healthy
and
exhibit
increased
bone
mineralization
by
microCT
analysis
.

Crossbreeding
of
Col1a1-Tnap
transgenic
mice
to
Alpl
(

)
mice
rescues
the
lethal
hypophosphatasia
phenotype
characteristic
of
this
disease
model
.

Osteoblasts
from
[

)
heterozygous
osteoblasts
,
while
Alpl
(
-

)
osteoblasts
show
no
mineralization
.

We
found
that
the
increased
levels
of
OPN
in
bone
tissue
of
Alpl
(
-

)
mice
are
comprised
of
phosphorylated
forms

;
Alpl

mice
had
both
phosphorylated
and
dephosphorylated
forms
of
OPN
.

OPN
from
[

osteoblasts
were
more
phosphorylated
than
non-transgenic
control

Titanium
dioxide-liquid

revealed
that

cancer
.
BACKGROUND
:
Theophylline
and
long
acting
beta2-agonists
are
bronchodilators
used
for
the
management
of
persistent
asthma
symptoms
,
especially
nocturnal
asthma
.

They
represent
different
classes
of
drug
with
differing
side-effect
profiles
.

OBJECTIVES
:
To
assess
the
comparative
efficacy
,
safety
and
side-effects
of
long-acting
beta-agonists
and
theophylline
in
the
maintenance
treatment
of
asthma
.

SEARCH
STRATEGY
:
Randomised
,
controlled
trials
(
RCTs
)
were
identified
using
the
Cochrane
Airways
Group
register
.

The
register
was
searched
using
the
following
terms
:
asthma
and
theophylline
and
long
acting
beta-agonist
or
formoterol
or
foradile
or
eformoterol
or
salmeterol
or
bambuterol
or
bitolterol
.

Titles
and
abstracts
were
then
screened
to
identify
potentially
relevant
studies
.

The
bibliography
of
each
RCT
was
searched
for
additional
RCTs
.

Authors
of
identified
RCTs
were
contacted
for
other
relevant
published
and
unpublished
studies
.

SELECTION
CRITERIA
:
All
included
studies
were
RCTs
involving
adults
and
children
with
clinical
evidence
of
asthma
.

These
studies
must
have
compared
oral
sustained
release
and
/
or
dose
adjusted
theophylline
with
an
inhaled
long-acting
beta-agonist
.

DATA
COLLECTION
AND
ANALYSIS
:
Potentially
relevant
trials
,
identified
by
screening
titles
and
/
or
abstracts
,
were
obtained
.

Two
reviewers
independently
assessed
full
text
versions
of
these
trials
to
decided
whether
the
trial
should
be
included
in
the
review
,
and
assessed
its
methodological
quality
.

Where
there
was
disagreement
between
reviewers
,
this
was
resolved
by
consensus
,
or
reference
to
a
third
party
.

Data
were
extracted
by
two
independent
reviewers
.

Inter-rater
reliability
was
assessed
by
simple
agreement
.

Study
authors
were
contacted
to
clarify
randomisation
methods
,
provide
missing
data
,
verify
the
data
extracted
and
identify
unpublished
studies
.

Relevant
pharmaceutical
manufacturers
were
also
contacted
.

MAIN
RESULTS
:
Six
trials
met
the
inclusion
criteria
.

Five
used
salmeterol
and
one
,
biltoterol
.

They
were
of
varying
quality
.

There
was
a
trend
for
salmeterol
to
improve
FEV1
more
than
theophylline
in
three
studies
and
salmeterol
use
was
associated
with
more
symptom
free
nights
.

Bitolterol
,
used
in
only
one
study
,
was
reported
to
be
less
effective
than
theophylline
.

Subjects
taking
salmeterol
experienced
fewer
adverse
events
than
those
using
theophylline

REVIEWER'S
CONCLUSIONS
:
Salmeterol
may
be
more
effective
than
theophylline

Systemic

whereas

and
the
systemic

which
were
blocked
by

.

These
findings
indicate
that
VTA
GABA
neurons
are
coupled
electrically
via
gap
junctions
and
that
the
inhibitory
effect
of
ethanol
on
electrical
transmission
is
primarily
via
inhibition
of
NMDA
receptor-mediated
excitation
,
not
via
enhancement
of
GABA
receptor-mediated

.

Thus
,
the
rewarding
properties
of

may
result
from
inhibitory
effects
on
excitatory
glutamatergic
neurotransmission
between
electrically
coupled
networks
of

Abnormal
uterine
bleeding
(
AUB
)
,
which
is
defined
as
excessively
heavy
,
prolonged
and
/
or
frequent
bleeding
of
uterine
origin
,
is
a
frequent
cause
of
visits
to
the
Emergency
Department
and
/
or
health
care
provider
.

While
there
are
many
etiologies
of
AUB
,
the
one
most
likely
among
otherwise
healthy
adolescents
is
dysfunctional
uterine
bleeding
(
DUB
)
,
which
is
characterizing
any
AUB
when
all
possible
underlying
pathologic
causes
have
been
previously
excluded
.

The
most
common
cause
of
DUB
in
adolescence
is
anovulation
,
which
is
very
frequent
in
the
first
2-3
post-menarchal
years
and
is
associated
with
immaturity
of
the
hypothalamic
-
pituitary
-
ovarian
axis
.

Management
of
AUB
is
based
on
the
underlying
etiology
and
the
severity
of
the
bleeding
and
primary
goals
are
prevention
of
complications
,
such
as
anemia
and
reestablishment
of
regular
cyclical
bleeding
,
while
the
management
of
DUB
can
in
part
be
directed
by
the
amount
of
flow
,
the
degree
of
associated
anemia
,
as
well
as
patient
and
family
comfort
with
different
treatment
modalities
.

Treatment
options
for
DUB
are
:
combined
oral
contraceptives
(
COCs
)
,
progestogens
,
non
steroidal
anti
inflammatory
drugs
(

Dabrafenib
is
a
BRAF
(
gene
encoding
serine
/
threonine-protein
kinase
B-Raf
)
inhibitor
that
has
been
developed
to
selectively
target
the
valine
600
to
glutamic
acid
substitution
(
BRAF
(
V600E
)
)
,
which
is
commonly
found
in
metastatic
melanoma
.

Clinical
trials
with
dabrafenib
have
shown
encouraging
results;
however
,
the
central
nervous
system
distribution
of
dabrafenib
remains
unknown
.

Thus
,
the
objective
of
the
current
study
was
to
evaluate
the
brain
distribution
of
dabrafenib
in
mice
,
and
to
see
whether
active
efflux
by
P-glycoprotein
(
P-gp
)
and
breast
cancer
resistance
protein
(
BCRP
)
restricts
its
delivery
across
the
blood-brain
barrier
(
BBB
)
.

In
vitro
accumulation
studies
conducted
in
Madin-Darby
canine
kidney
II
cells
indicate
that
dabrafenib
is
an
avid
substrate
for
both
P-gp
and
BCRP
.

Directional
flux
studies
revealed
greater
transport
in
the
basolateral
to
apical
direction
with
corrected
efflux
ratios
greater
than
2
for
both
P-gp
and
Bcrp1

Further
,
compared
with

,
another
BRAF
(

,
dabrafenib
showed
greater
brain
penetration
with
a
similar
dose
.

In
conclusion
,
the
dabrafenib
brain
distribution
is
limited
in
an
intact

and
the
data

have
clinical

The
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
investigate
the
role
of
insulin-degrading
enzyme
(
IDE
,
EC
3
.
4
.
22
.
11
)
in
insulin
degradation
in
alveolar
epithelium
.

The
primary
culture
of
isolated
rat
type-II
pneumocytes
was
used
for
the
in-vitro
characterization
of
IDE
.

Insulin
was
then
administered
intratracheally
with
various
inhibitors
to
assess
the
improvement
in
its
pulmonary
bioavailability
.

In
cultured
type-II
pneumocytes
,
the
cytosolic
insulin-degrading
activity
contributed
81%
of
total
insulin
degradation
,
reached
a
maximum
at
pH
7
.
5
and
had
an
apparent
Michaelis-Menten
constant
(
Km
)
of
135
nM
.

N-Ethylmaleimide
,
p-chloromercuribenzoic
acid
and
1
,
10-phenanthroline
inhibited
insulin-degrading
activity
almost
completely
in
both
crude
homogenate
and
cytosol
.

An
immunoprecipitation
study
showed
that
IDE
contributed
74%
of
cytosolic
insulin-degrading
activity
.

Western
blot
analysis
showing
a
single
band
of
110
kDa
on
reduced
SDS
(
sodium
dodecylsulphate
)
gels
confirmed
the
presence
of
IDE
in
cultured
type-II
cells
.

When
given
intratracheally
with
insulin
,
inhibitors
including
N-ethylmaleimide
,
p-chloromercuribenzoic
acid
,
and
1
,
10-phenanthroline
significantly
enhanced
the
absolute
bioavailability
of
insulin
and
the
compound's
hypoglycaemic
effects
.

These
results
suggest
that
IDE
is
present
in
alveolar
epithelium
and
might
be
involved
in
limiting
insulin
absorption
in
the
lung
.

OBJECTIVE
:
To
assess
the
fatty
acid
pattern
in
plasma
and
synovial
fluid
(
SF
)
in
rheumatoid
arthritis
(
RA
)
and
to
determine
clinical
factors
related
to
possible
abnormalities
.

METHODS
:
Thirty-nine
patients
with
RA
were
included
.

SF
samples
were
obtained
from
9
patients
.

Disease
activity
was
assessed
using
the
Ritchie
Articular
Index
and
erythrocyte
sedimentation
rate
.

Fatty
acids
were
assayed
with
gas
liquid
chromatography
.

RESULT
:
Decreased
levels
of
eicosapentaenoic
acid
(
p
<
0
.
0001
)
and
total
n3
polyunsaturated
fatty
acids
(
p
<
0
.
05
)
were
observed
in
plasma
and
in
joint
fluid
,
respectively
.

An
increase
of
the
substrates
of
delta-5-desaturase
(
C20
:
3n6
and
C20
:
2n6
)
and
decrease
of
their
products
(
C20
:
4n6
and
C22
:
4n6
)
was
observed
in
plasma
total
lipids
and
phospholipids
.

The
long
chain
mono-unsaturated
fatty
acids
(
C20
:
1n9
,
C22
:
1n9
,
C24
:
ln9
)
were
increased
in
the
joint
fluid
and
in
plasma
phospholipids
.

Patients
with
active
disease
showed
a
mild
decrease
of
several
saturated
fatty
acids
,
n3
,
and
n6
polyunsaturated
fatty
acids
.

Minor
abnormalities
or
no
changes
in
fatty
acid
profile
were
found
related
to
use
of
steroids
,
nonsteroidal
antiinflammatory
drugs
,
and
gold
salts
,
or
malnutrition
.

CONCLUSION
:
The
fatty
acid
pattern
found
in
RA
(
decreased
levels
of
n3
polyunsaturated
fatty
acids
)
may
explain
the
beneficial
effect
of
fish
oil
.

Changes
in
n6
polyunsaturated
fatty
acids
suggest
that
delta-5
desaturation
is
decreased
and
this
might
facilitate
the
antiinflammatory
effect
of
botanical
lipids
in
RA
.

OPINION
STATEMENT
:
Treatment
of
early
stage
breast
cancer
requires
a
multimodality
approach
in
order
to
eradicate
residual
cancer
and
prevent
recurrent
disease
.

Targeting
the
pathways
that
promote
or
sustain
cancer
cell
growth
and
invasion
is
critical
to
the
effective
treatment
of
breast
and
other
cancers
.

Overexpression
of
the
family
of
HER
receptors
have
been
associated
with
a
variety
of
malignancies;
the
first
and
best
studied
is
the
association
of
overexpression
of
the
HER2
/
neu
receptor
with
a
more
aggressive
breast
cancer
phenotype
and
poorer
survival
.

A
humanized
antibody
to
HER2
/
neu
,
trastuzumab
,
is
now
FDA
approved
for
the
treatment
of
early
stage
,
HER2
/
neu
overexpressing
breast
cancer
sequenced
with
chemotherapy
including
doxorubicin
,
cyclophosphamide
,
and
paclitaxel
.

Additional
international
and
national
studies
support
the
significant
impact
of
trastuzumab
on
both
disease
free
and
overall
survival
in
women
with
this
aggressive
form
of
breast
cancer
.

Toxicity
includes
a
low
but
clear
risk
of
congestive
heart
failure
,
and
the
large
phase
III
trials
have
helped
to
determine
which
patients
are
at
higher
risk
for
this
complication
.

Non-anthracycline
containing
regimens
are
an
alternative
therapy
associated
with
reduced
cardiac
toxicity
.

Trastuzumab
therapy
is
now
the
standard
of
care
for
the
treatment
of
early
stage
,
HER2
/
neu
positive
breast
cancer
given
in
combination
with
one
of
several
chemotherapy
regimens
.

Ongoing
questions
include
the
appropriate
duration
of
trastuzumab
treatment
as
well
as
the
optimal
chemotherapy
regimen
and
sequence
.

The
next
large
phase
III
adjuvant
trial
for
this
subset
of
breast
cancer
is
an
international
collaboration
designed
to
evaluate
the
added
or
alternative
benefit
of
an
oral
tyrosine
kinase
inhibitor
targeting
HER2
/
neu
as
well
as
the
epidermal
growth
factor
receptor
(
EGFR
)
,
lapatinib
.

Other
trials
are
investigating
differences
in
duration
.

Studies
in
the
neoadjuvant
setting
should
help
to
define
markers
of
trastuzumab
and
lapatinib
sensitivity
and
resistance
.

Preliminary
data
combining
trastuzumab
with
the
antiangiogenic
antibody
bevacizumab
is
encouraging;
this
combination
will
be
tested
in
both
early
stage
and
late
stage
disease

BACKGROUND
:
Systemic
lupus
erythematosus
(
SLE
)
is
a
complex
genetic
disease;
the
histamine
H4
receptor
(
HRH4
)
has
been
shown
to
be
related
to
different
kinds
of
autoimmune
disorders;
and
copy
number
variations
(
CNVs
)
have
been
found
to
be
associated
with
various
types
of
diseases
.

OBJECTIVES
:
To
explore
a
possible
association
between
HRH4
(
formerly
H4R
)
CNVs
and
the
risk
of
SLE
.

METHODS
:
Genomic
DNA
and
RNA
from
340
patients
with
SLE
and
392
healthy
controls
were
extracted
,
and
CNVs
and
mRNA
levels
of
HRH4
were
examined
.

RESULTS
:
The
expression
of
HRH4
mRNA
was
significantly
increased
in
patients
with
SLE
compared
with
controls
.

Amplification
of
HRH4

CONCLUSION
:

Abamectin
(
ABA
)
,
which
belongs
to
the
family
of
avermectins
,
is
used
as
a
parasiticide;
however
,
ABA
poisoning
can
impair
liver
function
.

In
a
previous
study
using
isolated
rat
liver
mitochondria
,
we
observed
that
ABA
inhibited
the
activity
of
adenine
nucleotide
translocator
and
FoF1-ATPase
.

The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
characterize
the
mechanism
of
ABA
toxicity
in
isolated
rat
hepatocytes
and
to
evaluate
whether
this
effect
is
dependent
on
its
metabolism
.

The
toxicity
of
ABA
was
assessed
by
monitoring
oxygen
consumption
and
mitochondrial
membrane
potential
,
intracellular
ATP
concentration
,
cell
viability
,
intracellular
Ca
(
2
+
)
homeostasis
,
release
of
cytochrome
c
,
caspase
3
activity
and
necrotic
cell
death
.

ABA
reduces
cellular
respiration
in
cells
energized
with
glutamate
and
malate
or
succinate
.

The
hepatocytes
that
were
previously
incubated
with
proadifen
,
a
cytochrome
P450
inhibitor
,
are
more
sensitive
to
the
compound
as
observed
by
a
rapid
decrease
in
the
mitochondrial
membrane
potential
accompanied
by
reductions
in
ATP
concentration
and
cell
viability
and
a
disruption
of
intracellular
Ca
(
2
+
)
homeostasis
followed
by
necrosis
.

Our
results
indicate
that
ABA
biotransformation
reduces
its
toxicity
,
and
its
toxic
action
is
related
to
the
inhibition
of
mitochondrial
activity
,
which
leads
to
decreased
synthesis
of
ATP
followed
by
cell
death
.
Selective
adhesion
of
plasma
proteins
to
immobilized
heparin
is
considered
to
be
beneficial
regarding
hemocompatibility
of
foreign
materials
in
contact
with
blood
.

Prothrombin
,
thrombin
,
antithrombin
III
(
AT3
)
,
and
fibrinogen
were
selected
for
analysis
in
an
experimental
model
.

Biomolecular
interaction
analysis
employing
surface
plasmon
resonance
was
utilized
to
record
and
analyze
their
binding
properties
in
real
time
.

Biotinylated
heparin
,
heparin-albumin
conjugate
,
and
albumin
,
respectively
,
were
immobilized
onto
streptavidin-coated
sensors
as
ligands
.

Prothrombin
did
not
bind
to
any
of
the
ligand
surfaces
and
no
specific
binding
of
any
of
the
plasma
proteins
to
albumin
was
observed
.

Binding
kinetics
of
thrombin
to
heparin
and
to
heparin-albumin
conjugate
were
calculated
using
two
different
methods
.

For
heparin
,
identical
K
(
D
)
(
equilibrium
dissociation
constant
)
values
of
61
x
10
(
-9
)
M
were
obtained
with
both
methods
.

For
the
conjugate
,
only
slightly
different
K
(
D
)
values
of
111
x
10
(
-9
)
and
104
x
10
(
-9
)
M
,
respectively
,
were
calculated
.

The
affinity
of
thrombin
toward
the
heparin-coated
surface
proved
to
be
higher
than
its
affinity
toward
the
heparin
conjugate
.

The
binding
pattern
of
AT3
to
both
heparin
and
heparin-albumin
conjugate
,
although
specific
,
was
biphasic
,
possibly
due
to

For

a

was
calculated
,
indicating

conjugate
.

A
high-affinity
binding
of
fibrinogen
to
high-density
surfaces
of
both
heparin
and
the
conjugate
was
observed
.

However
,
as

The
plant
growth
regulator
ethephon
(
2-chloroethylphosphonic
acid
)
inhibits
human
butyrylcholinesterase
(
BChE
)
by
making
a
covalent
adduct
on
the
active
site
serine
198
.

Our
goal
was
to
extend
earlier
studies
on
ethephon
inhibition
.

Addition
of
freshly
prepared
ethephon
to
BChE
in
buffered
medium
,
at
pH
7
.
0
and
22
°C
,
resulted
in
no
inhibition
initially
.

However
,
inhibition
developed
progressively
over
60
min
of
incubation
.

Preincubation
of
ethephon
in
pH
7-9
buffers
increased
its
initial
inhibitory
potency
.

These
observations
indicated
that
ethephon
itself
was
not
the
inhibitor
.

About
3%
of
the
initial
ethephon
could
be
trapped
as
a
BChE
adduct
.

Mass
spectral
analysis
of
the
active
site
peptide
from
inhibited
BChE
showed
that
the
inhibitor
added
a
mass
of
108
Da
to
the
active
site
serine
on
peptide
FGES198AGAAS
.

This
result
rules
out
a
previous
hypothesis
that
ethephon
adds
HPO3
to
BChE
(
added
mass
of
80
Da
)
.

To
accommodate
these
observations
,
we
propose
that
in
aqueous
media
at
neutral
to
slightly
alkaline
pH
about
3%
of
the
ethephon
is
converted
(
t1
/

at

)
into
a
cyclic
oxaphosphetane
which
is
the
actual
BChE
inhibitor
forming
the
2-hydroxyethylphosphonate
adduct
on
BChE
at
Ser198
while
about
97%
of
the
ethephon
breaks
down
to
ethylene
(
t1

Primary
hepatocyte
cultures
are
now
considered
as
convenient
models
for
in
vitro
analyzing
liver
drug
transport
.

However
,
if
primary
human
and
rat
hepatocytes
have
been
well-characterized
with
respect
to
drug
transporter
expression
and
regulation
,
much
less
is
known
for
primary
mouse
hepatocytes
.

The
present
study
was
therefore
designed
to
gain
insights
about
this
point
.

The
profile
of
sinusoidal
and
canalicular
drug
transporter
mRNA
expression
in
short
time
(
4h
)
-cultured
mouse
hepatocytes
was
found
to
be
highly
correlated
with
that
of
freshly
isolated
hepatocytes;
by
contrast
,
those
of
counterparts
cultured
for
a
longer
time
(
until
4days
)
either
in
monolayer
configurations
on
plastic
or
collagen
or
in
sandwich
configuration
with
matrigel
were
profoundly
altered
:
uptake
drug
transporters
such
as
Oct1
,
Oatps
and
Oat2
were
thus
down-regulated
,
whereas
most
of
efflux
transporters
such
as
Mdr1a
/
b
,
Mrp3
,
Mrp4
and
Bcrp
were
induced
.

Moreover
,
short
time-cultured
hepatocytes
exhibited
the
highest
levels
of
sinusoidal
influx
transporter
activities
.

Transporter-mediated
drug
secretion
into
canalicular
networks
was
however
only
observed
in
sandwich-cultured
hepatocytes
.

Mouse
hepatocytes
cultured
either
in
monolayer
or
sandwich
configurations
were
finally
shown
to
exhibit
up-regulation
of
referent
transporters
in
response
to
exposure
to
prototypical
activators
of
the
drug
sensing
receptors
pregnane
X
receptor
,
aryl
hydrocarbon
receptor
or
constitutive
androstane
receptor
.

Taken
together
,
these
data
demonstrate
the
feasibility
of
using
primary
mouse
hepatocytes
for
investigating
potential
interactions
of
xenobiotics
with
hepatic
transporter
activity

regulation
,
provided
that
adequate

Rett
syndrome
(
RTT
)
is
a
pervasive
neurodevelopmental
disorder
,
primarily
affecting
girls
.

RTT
causes
a
wide
variety
of
debilitating
symptoms
and
no
cure
currently
exists
.

Mouse
models
bearing
mutations
in
the
Mecp2
gene
recapitulate
most
physiological
and
behavioural
RTT-related
abnormalities
.

Stimulating

brief
maternal
separations
or

)
reduce
stress
and
fear
responses
at
adulthood
.

The
present
study
investigated
whether
impacting
early
in
development
the
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
axis
,
by
exposing
Mecp2-308
mutant
pups
to
a
low
dose
of
corticosterone
(
50
µg
/
ml
,
during
the
1st
week
of
life
)
may
contrast
RTT-related
abnormalities
in
neuroendocrine
regulation
and
behavioural
adaptation
at
adulthood
.

In
line
with
previous
reports
,
when
fully
symptomatic
,
MeCP2-308
mice
showed
a
reduction
in
the
regular
nocturnal
hyperactivity
in
the
home-cage
and
increased
anxiety-like
behaviours
and
plasma
corticosterone
(
CORT
)
levels
in
response
to
restraint
stress
.

An
abnormal
elevation
in
mRNA
levels
of
mineralocorticoid
receptors
(
MR
)
and
BDNF
gene
was
also
evident
in
the
hippocampus
of
fully
symptomatic
mutant
mice
.

Neonatal
CORT
modulated
MR
gene
expression
and
behavioural
reactivity
towards
a
novel
object
,
also
restoring
wt-like
levels
of
locomotor
/
exploratory
behaviour
in
mutant
mice
.

Enhanced
sensitivity
to
the
neonatal
treatment
(
in
terms
of
increase
in
GR
and
MR
mRNA
levels
)
,
was
also
evident
in
the
hippocampus
of
MeCP2-308
mice
compared
to
wt
littermates
.

Present
results
corroborate
the
hypothesis
that
targeting
the
glucocorticoid
system
may
prove
valid
in
contrasting
at
least
some
of
the
RTT-related
symptoms
and
provide
evidence
that
pharmacological
interventions
during
critical
early
time
windows
can
persistently
improve
the
behavioural
phenotype
of
RTT
mice
.

Current
data
also
support
the
emerging
role
played
by
Mecp2
in
mediating
the
epigenetic
programming
induced
by
early
life
events
and
indicate
that
,
in
the
absence
of
functional
MeCP2
,
programming
of
the
central
nervous
system
in
response
to
early
environmental
stimuli
is
abnormally
regulated
.

Panaxadiol

,
which
exhibits

.

Epigallocatechin
gallate
(
EGCG
)
,
a
major
catechin
in
green
tea
,
is
a
strong
botanical
antioxidant
.

In
this
study
,
we
investigated
the
possible
synergistic
anticancer
effects
of
PD
and
EGCG
on
human
colorectal
cancer
cells
and
explored
the
potential
role
of
apoptosis
in
the
synergistic
activities
.

Effects
of
selected
compounds
on
HCT-116
and
SW-480
human
colorectal
cancer
cells
were
evaluated
by
a
modified

were
analyzed
by
flow

after

.

Cell
growth
was
suppressed
after
treatment
with
PD
(
10

20
µm
)
for
48
h
.

When
PD
(
10

20
µm
)
was
combined
with
EGCG
(
10
,
20
,
and
30
µm
)
,
significantly
enhanced
antiproliferative
effects
were
observed
in
both
cell
lines
.

Combining
20
µm
of
PD
with
20
and
30
µm
of
EGCG
significantly
decreased
S-phase
fractions
of
cells
.

In
the
apoptotic
assay
,
the
combination
of
PD
and
EGCG
significantly
increased
the
percentage
of
apoptotic
cells
compared
with
PD
alone
(

)
.

The
synergistic
apoptotic
effects
were
also
supported
by
docking
analysis
,
which
demonstrated
that
PD
and
EGCG
bound
in
two
different
sites

the
annexin

Data
from
this

suggested
that

Mammalian
cysteine
dioxygenase
(
CDO
)
is
a
non-heme
iron
metalloenzyme
that
catalyzes
the
first
committed
step
in
oxidative
cysteine
catabolism
.

The
active
site
coordination
of
CDO
comprises
a
mononuclear
iron
ligated
by
the
Nepsilon
atoms
of
three
protein-derived
histidines
,
thus
representing
a
new
variant
on
the
2-histidine-1-carboxylate
(
2H1C
)
facial
triad
motif
.

Nitric
oxide
was
used
as
a
spectroscopic
probe
in
investigating
the
order
of
substrate-O2
binding
by
EPR
spectroscopy
.

In
these
experiments
,
CDO
exhibits
an
ordered
binding
of
l-cysteine
prior
to
NO
(
and
presumably
O2
)
similar
to
that
observed
for
the
2H1C
class
of
non-heme
iron
enzymes
.

Moreover
,
the
CDO
active
site
is
essentially
unreactive
toward
NO
in
the
absence
of
substrate
,
suggesting
an
obligate
ordered
binding
of
l-cysteine
prior
to
NO
.

Typically
,
addition
of
NO
to
a
mononuclear
non-heme
iron
center
results
in
the
formation
of
an
{FeNO}7
(
S
=
3
/
2
)
species
characterized
by
an
axial
EPR
spectrum
with
gx
,
gy
,
and
gz
values
of
approximately
4
,
approximately
4
,
and
approximately
2
,
respectively
.

However
,
upon
addition
of
NO
to
CDO
in
the
presence
of
substrate
l-cysteine
,
a
low-spin
{FeNO}7
(
S
=
1
/
2
)
signal
that
accounts
for
approximately
85%
of
the
iron
within
the
enzyme
develops
.

Similar
{FeNO}7
(
S
=
1
/
2
)
EPR
signals
have
been
observed
for
a
variety
of
octahedral
mononuclear
iron-nitrosyl
synthetic
complexes;
however
,
this
type
of
iron-nitrosyl
species
is
not
commonly
observed
for
non-heme
iron
enzymes
.

Substitution
of
l-cysteine
with
isosteric
substrate
analogues
cysteamine
,
3-mercaptopropionic
acid
,
and
propane
thiol
did
not
produce
any
analogous
{FeNO}7
signals
(
S
=
1
/
2
or
3
/
2
)
,
thus
reflecting
the
high
substrate
specificity
of
the
enzyme
observed
by
a
number
of
researchers
.

The
unusual
{FeNO}7
(
S
=
1
/
2
)
electronic
configuration
adopted
by
the
substrate-bound
iron-nitrosyl
CDO
(
termed
{ES-NO}7
)
is
a
result
of
the
bidentate
thiol
/
amine
coordination
of
l-cysteine
in
the
NO-bound
CDO
active
site
.

DFT
computations
were
performed
to
further
characterize
this
species
.

The
DFT-predicted
geometric
parameters
for
{ES-NO}7
are
in
good
agreement
with
the
crystallographically
determined
substrate-bound
active
site
configuration
of
CDO
and
are
consistent
with
known
iron-nitrosyl
model
complexes
.

Moreover
,
the
computed
EPR
parameters
(
g
and

values
)
are
in
excellent
agreement
with

The
understanding
of
the
neurobiological
processes
leading
to
major
depressive
disorder
(
MDD
)
is
an
active
field
of
research
in
the
scientific
community
.

For
years
,
the
alteration
of
monoamine
neurotransmission
,
in
particular
serotonin
(
5-HT
)
,
has
been
considered
the
most
significant
pathophysiological
mechanism
of
the
disorder
.

However
,
biological
data
supporting
the
postulated
MDD-related
monoamine
alterations
have
been
inconclusive
,
and
the
use
of
monoaminergic
antidepressants
has
not
yielded
the
expected
results
.

In
the
last
few
years
,
it
has
been
demonstrated
that
inflammatory
pathways
have
a
significant
role
in
the
pathophysiology
of
MDD
.

According
to
the
cytokine
hypothesis
,
the
disorder
would
be
due
to
a
stress-related
increased
production
of
cytokines
,
including
interleukins
,
tumor
necrosis
factor-
α
and
interferon-
α
and
γ
.

These
,
in
turns
,
would
cause
the
activation
of
the
indoleamine
2
,
3
dioxygenase
(
IDO
)
,
with
subsequent
production
of
tryptophan
(
TRP
)
catabolites
along
the
IDO
pathway
(
TRYCATs
)
and
decreased
availability
of
TRP
and
5-HT
.

Besides
monoamines
,
other
molecular
mechanisms
,
as
those
within
the
inflammatory
pathways
,
should
be
taken
into
account
in
the
attempt
to
clarify
the
pathophysiology
of
MDD
and
to
improve
its
treatment
.
Sodium-glucose

To

of

and

meclizine
and
homochlorcyclizine;
phenothiazines
:
promethazine
)
on
neuronal
uptake
of
dopamine
(
DA
)
,
noradrenaline
(
NA
)
,
and
5-hydroxytryptamine
(
5-HT
)
,
the
effects
on
the
turnover
of
these
monoamines
were
examined
in
the
mouse
brain
,
based
on
the
alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine-induced
depletion
of
DA
and
NA
or
probenecid-induced
accumulation
of
5-hydroxyindoleacetic
acid
.

The
DA
turnover
was
reduced
remarkably
by
diphenhydramine
,
tripelennamine
,
and
promethazine
,
and
also
significantly
by
chlorpheniramine
,
mepyramine
,
clemizole
,
and
homochlorcyclizine
,
at
doses
used
in
the
ordinary
animal
experiments
.

The
5-HT
turnover
was
reduced
markedly
by
mepyramine
,
tripelennamine
,
and
chlorpheniramine
.

In
contrast
,
the
NA
turnover
was
increased
by
promethazine
and
homochlorcyclizine
,
possibly
due
to
their
antagonistic
effects
on
alpha-adrenoceptors
.

These
results
suggest
that
(
1
)
the
degree
of
inhibition
of
the
uptake
of
DA
and
5-HT
by
histamine
H1-receptor
antagonists
is
considerably
different
,
(
2
)
most
H1-antagonists
have
little
influence
on
NA
uptake
and
some
compounds
enhance
NA
release
,
and
that
(
3
)
carbinoxamine
,
clemastine
,
triprolidine
,
and
meclizine
have
comparatively
weak
influences
on
monoamine
metabolism
.

These
effects
on
brain
monoamine
systems
may
be
related
to
some
central
actions
of
histamine
H1-receptor
antagonists
,
such
as
an
addiction
to
these
compounds
combined
with
opioids
.
In
the
present
study
,
we
investigated
the
effect
of
fenoterol-induced
constitutive
beta
(
2
)
-adrenoceptor
activity
on
muscarinic
receptor
agonist-
and
histamine-induced
bovine

Bovine
tracheal

strips
were
incubated
with

microM
fenoterol
or

for
various
periods
of
time
(
5
,
30
min
,
18
h
)
at
37
degrees
C
.

After
extensive
washout
(
3
h
,
37
degrees
C
)
,
isometric
contractions
were
measured
to
the
full
muscarinic
receptor
agonist
methacholine
,
the
partial
muscarinic
receptor
agonist
4-
(
m-chlorophenyl-carbamoyloxy
)
-2-butynyltrimethylammonium
(
McN-A-343
)
and
histamine
.

Fenoterol
treatment
significantly
reduced
the
sensitivity
(
pEC
(
50
)
)
to
methacholine
in
a
time-dependent
manner
,
without
affecting
maximal
contraction
(
E
(
max
)
)
.

Fenoterol
treatment
similarly
reduced
the
pEC
(
50
)
of
McN-A-343
and
histamine;
however
,
E
(
max
)
values
were
also
reduced
,
to
approximately
70%
of
control
after
18-h
treatment
.

The
inverse
agonist
timolol
,
having
no
effect
on
control
preparations
,
consistently
restored
the
reduced
pEC
(
50
)
and
E
(
max
)
values
of
the
contractile
agonists
.

Remarkably
,
in
the
presence
of
timolol

,
after

Chronic
morphine
leads
to
compensatory
up-regulation
of
cAMP
signaling
pathways
in
numerous
brain
regions
.

One
potential
consequence
of
up-regulated
cAMP
signaling
is
increased
phosphorylation
of
cAMP
response
element
binding
protein
(
CREB
)
,
a
transcription
factor
that
may
regulate
neuroadaptations
related
to
morphine
dependence
.

Altered
gene
expression
within
the
nucleus
accumbens
(
NAc

,
a
ventral
component
of
the

that
receives
substantial
dopaminergic
input
,
may
play
a
role
in
some
of
the
motivational
aspects
of
opiate
withdrawal
.

To
determine
if
morphine
withdrawal
leads
to
increased
CREB
phosphorylation
in
striatal
tissues
,
we
examined
the
effects
of
naloxone-precipitated
morphine
withdrawal
on
CREB
phosphorylation
in
primary
cultures
of
rat
striatal
neurons
.

Precipitated
morphine
withdrawal
was
associated
with
enhanced
dopamine-
,
SKF

(
D1
receptor
agonist
)
-
,
and
forskolin-induced
CREB
phosphorylation
.

During
precipitated
withdrawal
,
D1
receptor-mediated
CREB
phosphorylation
was
dependent
on
cAMP-dependent
protein
kinase
(
PKA
)
.

Precipitated
withdrawal
also
led
to
up-regulation
of
c-fos
mRNA
in
response
to
SKF
82958
.

CREB
protein
levels
were
not
altered
by
acute
or
chronic
morphine
.

These
results
suggest
that
D1
receptor-mediated
signal
transduction
is
enhanced
during
morphine
withdrawal
.

Furthermore
,
they
are
consistent
with
in
vivo
evidence
suggesting
that
increased
CREB
activation
in
portions
of

revealed
that

The

closely
matched
the

In

these

indicate
that

a

recognizes

Recent

biology
have
characterised
a
new
class
of
chloride
channels
(
CLCs
)
that
are
referred
to
as
voltage-gated
CLCs
.

To
date
nine
such
voltage-gated
CLCs
(
CLC-1

CLC-7

CLC-Ka
and
CLC-Kb
,
which
are
encoded
by
the
genes
CLCN1

CLCN7

CLC-Ka

,
respectively
)
have
been
identified
in
mammals

Mutations
in
two
of
these
,
CLC-5
and

,
have
been
defined
in
the
hypercalciuric
nephrolithiasis
disorders

a
form
of

respectively

In
addition

other
forms

have
been
defined
with
mutations
involving
the
bumetanide-sensitive
sodium-potassium-chloride
cotransporter

and
the
potassium
channel
ROMK

Finally
,
mutations

Although
minocycline
does
not
directly
inhibit
these

,
the
effects
may
result
from
interference
with
upstream
mechanisms
resulting
in
their
secondary
activation
.

Because
the
above-mentioned
factors
are
important
in
amyotrophic

(

)
,
we
tested
minocycline
in
mice
with
ALS
.

Here
we
report
that
minocycline
delays
disease
onset
and
extends
survival
in
ALS
mice
.

Given
the
broad
efficacy
of
minocycline
,
understanding
its
mechanisms
of
action
is
of
great
importance
.

We
find
that
minocycline
inhibits
mitochondrial
permeability-transition-mediated
cytochrome

release
.

Minocycline-mediated
inhibition
of
cytochrome
c
release
is
demonstrated
in

,
in
cells
,
and
in
isolated
mitochondria
.

Understanding
the
mechanism
of
action
of
minocycline
will
assist
in
the
development

testing
of
more
powerful
and
effective
analogues
.

Because
of
the
safety
record
of
minocycline
,
and
its
ability
to
penetrate
the

,
this

The
following
was

Anandron

the

CPT

(

I
)
catalyses
the
conversion
of

into
palmitoylcarnitine
in
the
presence
of
L-carnitine
,
facilitating
the
entry
of
fatty
acids

.

We
propose
a
3-D
(
three-dimensional
)
structural
model
for
L-CPT
I
(
liver
CPT
I
)
,
based
on
the
similarity
of
this
enzyme
to
the
recently
crystallized
mouse
carnitine
acetyltransferase
.

The
model
includes
607
of
the
773
amino
acids
of
L-CPT
I
,
and
the
positions
of
carnitine
,
CoA
and
the
palmitoyl
group
were
assigned
by
superposition
and
docking
analysis
.

Functional
analysis
of
this
3-D
model
included
the
mutagenesis
of
several
amino
acids
in
order
to
identify
putative
catalytic
residues
.

Mutants
D477A
,
D567A
and
E590D
showed
reduced
L-CPT
I
activity
.

In
addition
,
individual
mutation
of
amino
acids
forming
the
conserved
Ser685-Thr686-Ser687
motif
abolished
enzyme
activity
in
mutants
T686A
and
S687A
and
altered
K
(
m
)
and
the
catalytic
efficiency
for
carnitine
in
mutant
S685A
.

We
conclude
that
the
catalytic
residues
are
His473
and
Asp477
,
while
Ser687
probably
stabilizes
the
transition

STUDY
OBJECTIVE
:
Rebound
hypersomnolence
(
RHS
:
increased
sleep
following
increased
wake
)
is
a
limiting
side-effect
of
many
wake-promoting
agents
.

In
particular
,
RHS
in
the
first
few
hours
following
wake
appears
to
be
associated
with
dopamine
(
DA
)
-releasing
agents
,
e
.

g
.

,
amphetamine
,
but
whether
it
can
also
be
produced
by
DA
transporter
(
DAT
)
inhibition
alone
is
unknown
.

In
these
studies
,
DA-releasing
and
DAT-inhibiting
agents
and
their
interaction
were
systematically
examined
for
their
ability
to
increase
wake
and
induce
RHS
.

DESIGN
:
Chronically
implanted
rats
were
evaluated
in
a
blinded
,
pseudo-randomized
design
.

PARTICIPANTS
:
237
rats
were
used
in
these
studies
with
1
week
between
repeat
tests
.

INTERVENTIONS
:
Animals
were
habituated
overnight
and
dosed
the
next
day
,
5
h
after
lights
on
,
with
test
agents
.

MEASUREMENTS
AND
RESULTS
:
Sleep
/
wake
activityand
RHS
were
evaluated
using
EEG
/
EMG
recording
up
to
22
h
post
dosing
.

In
vitro
dopamine
release
was
evaluated
in
rat
synaptosomes
.

At
doses
that
produced
equal
increases
in
wake
,
DA-releasing
(
amphetamine
,
methamphetamine
,
phentermine
)
and
several
DAT-inhibiting
agents
(
cocaine
,
bupropion
,
and
methylphenidate
)
produced
RHS
during
the
first
few
hours
after
the
onset
of
sleep
recovery
.

However
,
other
DAT-inhibiting
agents
(
mazindol
,
nomifensine
,
GBR-12909
,
and
GBR-12935
)
did
not
produce
RHS
.

Combination
treatment
with
amphetamine
and
nomifensine
produced
waking
activity
greater
than
the
sum
of
their
individual
activities
alone
while
ameliorating
the
amphetamine-like
RHS
.

In
rat
synaptosomes
,
nomifensine
reduced
the
potency
of
amphetamine
to
induce
DA
release
approximately
270-fold
,
potentially
explaining
its
action
in
ameliorating
amphetamine-induced
RHS
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
All
DA
releasing
agents
tested
,
and
some
DAT-inhibiting
agents
,
produced
RHS
at
equal
wake-promoting
doses
.

Thus
amphetamine-like
DA
release
appears
sufficient
for
inducing
RHS
,
but
additional
properties
(
pharmacologic
and
/
or
pharmacokinetic
)
evidently
underlie
RHS
of
other
DAT
inhibitors
.

Enhancing
wake
while
mitigating
RHS
can
be
achieved
by
combining
DAT-inhibiting
and
DA-releasing
agents
.

Mammary
adipose
tissue
may
contribute
to
breast
cancer
development
and
progression
by
altering
neighboring
epithelial
cell
behavior
and
phenotype
through
paracrine
signaling
.

Dietary
exposure
to
soy
foods
is
associated
with
lower
mammary
tumor
risk
and
reduced
body
weight
and
adiposity
in
humans
and
in
rodent
breast
cancer
models
.

Despite
the
suggested
linkage
between
obesity
and
breast
cancer
,
the
local
influence
of
bioactive
dietary
components
on
mammary
adiposity
for
anti-tumor
effects
remains
unknown
.

Herein
,
we
report
that
post-weaning
dietary
exposure
to
soy
protein
isolate
and
its
bioactive
isoflavone
genistein
lowered
mammary
adiposity
and
increased
mammary
tumor
suppressor

and
E-cadherin
expression
in
female
mice
,
relative
to

.

To
ascertain
genistein's
role
in
mammary
adipose
deposition
that
may
affect
underlying
epithelial
cell

,
we
evaluated
genistein's
effects
on
SV40-immortalized
mouse
mammary
stromal
fibroblast-like

MSF
)
cells
during
differentiation
to
adipocytes
.

MSF
cultured

with
40
nM
genistein
showed
reductions
in
mature
adipocyte
numbers
,
triglyceride
accumulation
,
and
PPARγ
and

transcript
levels
.

Genistein
inhibition
of
adipose

was
accompanied
by
increased
estrogen

expression
and
was
modestly
recapitulated
by
ERβ
selective
agonist
2
,
3-bis
(

-propionitrile
(

.

Reduction
of
ERβ

by

increased
PPARγ

and
stromal
fibroblast

into
mature
adipocytes;
the
latter
was

PURPOSE
:
We
determined
the
effects
of
vorinostat
[
suberoylanilide
hydroxamic
acid
(
SAHA
)
]
and
/
or
dasatinib
,
a
dual
Abl
/
Src
kinase
(
tyrosine
kinase
)
inhibitor
,
on
the
cultured
human
(
K562
and
LAMA-84
)
or
primary
chronic
myelogenous
leukemia
(
CML
)
cells
,
as
well
as
on
the
murine
pro-B
BaF3
cells
with
ectopic
expression
of
the
unmutated
and
kinase
domain-mutant
forms
of
Bcr-Abl
.

EXPERIMENTAL
DESIGN
:
Following
exposure
to
dasatinib
and
/
or
vorinostat
,
apoptosis
,
loss
of
clonogenic
survival
,
as
well
as
the
activity
and
levels
of
Bcr-Abl
and
its
downstream
signaling
proteins
were
determined
.

RESULTS
:
Treatment
with
dasatinib
attenuated
the
levels
of
autophosphorylated
Bcr-Abl
,
p-CrkL
,
phospho-signal
transducer
and
activator
of
transcription
5
(
p-STAT5
)
,
p-c-Src
,
and
p-Lyn;
inhibited
the
activity
of
Lyn
and
c-Src;
and
induced
apoptosis
of
the
cultured
CML
cells
.

Combined
treatment
of
cultured
human
CML
and
BaF3
cells
with
vorinostat
and
dasatinib
induced
more
apoptosis
than
either
agent
alone
,
as
well
as
synergistically
induced
loss
of
clonogenic
survival
,
which
was
associated
with
greater
depletion
of
Bcr-Abl
,
p-CrkL
,
and
p-STAT5
levels
.

Cotreatment
with
dasatinib
and
vorinostat
also
attenuated
the
levels
of
Bcr-AblE255K
and
Bcr-AblT315I
and
induced
apoptosis
of
BaF3
cells
with
ectopic
expression
of
the
mutant
forms
of
Bcr-Abl
.

Finally
,
cotreatment
of
the
primary
CML
cells
with
vorinostat
and
dasatinib
induced
more
loss
of
cell
viability
and
depleted
Bcr-Abl
or
Bcr-AblT315I
,
p-STAT5
,
and
p-CrkL
levels
than
either
agent
alone
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
As
shown
here
,
the
preclinical
in
vitro
activity
of
vorinostat
and
dasatinib
against
cultured
and
primary
CML
cells
supports
the
in

testing
of
the
combination
in
imatinib
mesylate-sensitive
and

RATIONALE
:
A
common
polymorphism
(
5HTTLPR
)
within
the
promoter
region
of
the
serotonin
transporter
gene
(
LSC6A4
)
has
been
shown
to
influence
response
time
as
well
as
overall
response
to
selective
serotonin
reuptake
inhibitors
(
SSRIs
)
in
subjects
with
major
depressive
disorder
.

We
hypothesized
that
a
similar
effect
in
response
time
to
sertraline
would
be
observed
and
that
no
effect
on
response
time
would
be
seen
in
a
placebo
arm
.

OBJECTIVES
:
We
tested
the
hypothesis
that
subjects
homozygous
for
the
long
allele
at
the
5HTTLPR
polymorphism
would
respond
more
rapidly
to
sertraline
than
subjects
carrying
one
or
two
copies
of
the
short
allele
.

METHODS
:
HAM-D
and
CGI-I
responses
to
sertraline
and
placebo
were
measured
weekly
in
the
context
of
an
8-week
,
placebo-controlled
study
in
elderly
depressed
subjects
.

Genotyping
of
the
5HTTLPR
polymorphism
was
performed
to
test
for
correlations
with
response
at
each
week
in
the
sertraline
and
placebo
groups
(
n
=
206
)
.

RESULTS
:
Subjects
homozygous
for
the
long
allele
of
5HTTLPR
showed
a
significant
increase
in
response
at
week
1
and
week
2
,
as
assessed
by
the
CGI-I
scale
compared
with
subjects
carrying
one
or
two
copies
of
the
short
allele
(
P
=
0
.
01
at
both
weeks
)
.

No
significant
difference
was
observed
in
the
placebo
group
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
These
results
suggest
that
genetic
variation
in
the
serotonin
transporter
gene
effects
the
response
time
to
sertraline
and
provides
complementing
evidence
to
previous
reports
that
this
polymorphism
affects
response
time
to
other
SSRIs
.
Insulin
is
synthesized
in
the
pancreatic
beta
cell
as
a
larger
precursor
molecule
proinsulin
which
is
converted
to
insulin
and
C-peptide
by
the
concerted
action
of
prohormone
convertase
2
(
PC2
)
,
prohormone
convertase
3
(
PC3
)
and
carboxypeptidase
E
(
CPE
)
.

One
of
the
features
of
non-insulin-dependent
diabetes
mellitus
(
NIDDM
)
is
an
elevation
in
the
proinsulin
level
and
/
or
proinsulin
/
insulin
molar
ratio
suggesting
that
mutations
in
these
three
proinsulin
processing
enzymes
might
contribute
to
the
development
of
NIDDM
.

The
identification
of
a
mutation
in
the
CPE
gene
of
the
fat
/
fat
mouse
which
leads
to
marked
hyperproinsulinaemia
and
late-onset
obesity
and
diabetes
is
consistent
with
a
possible
role
for
mutations
in
CPE
in
the
development
of
diabetes
and
obesity
in
humans
.

In
order
to
test
this
hypothesis
,
we
have
isolated
and
characterized
the
human
CPE
gene
and
screened
it
for
mutations
in
a
group
of
Japanese
subjects
with
NIDDM
and
obesity
.

The
human
CPE
gene
consists
of
9
exons
spanning
more
than
60
kb
.

Primer
extension
analysis
identified
the
transcriptional
start
site
at
-141
bp
from
the
translational
start
site
.

Single
strand
conformational
polymorphism
analysis
and
nucleotide
sequencing
of
the
promoter
and
entire
coding
region
of
the
CPE
gene
in
269
Japanese
subjects
with
NIDDM
,
28
nondiabetic
obese
subjects
and
104
nonobese
and
nondiabetic
controls
revealed
three
nucleotide
changes
,
a
G-to-T
substitution
at
nucleotide
-53
,
a
G-to-A
substitution
at
nucleotide
-144
(
relative
to
start
of
transcription
)
in
the
promoter
region
and
a
silent
G-to-A
substitution
in
codon
219
.

None
of
the
nucleotide
substitutions
were
associated
with
NIDDM
or
obesity
.

Thus
,
genetic
variation
in
the
CPE
gene
does
not
appear
to
play
a
major
role
in
the
pathogenesis
of
NIDDM
or
obesity
in
Japanese
subjects
.
Electrical
field
stimulation
(
EFS
)
of
guinea-pig
airways
,
in
vitro
,
evokes
an
excitatory
nonadrenergic
noncholinergic
(
eNANC
)
contraction
mediated
by
release
of
tachykinins
from
sensory
nerve
endings
.

Epinastine
(
WAL
801CL
)
is
an
antihistaminic
drug
with
binding
affinity
at
certain
other
receptors
,
including
alpha-adrenergic
receptors
and
various
serotonin
(
5-HT
)
receptor
subtypes
.

It
is
used
in
asthma
treatment;
however
,
its
mechanism
of
action
remains
to
be
fully
defined
.

We
have
investigated
whether
epinastine
could
modulate
the
eNANC
contraction
in
guinea-pig
airways
in
vitro
,
and
have
tried
to
elucidate
its
receptor
mechanism
.

Epinastine
(
0
.
1-100
microM
)
produced
a
concentration-dependent
inhibition
of
the
noncholinergic
contraction
,
with
a
maximum
inhibition
of
91
+
/
-
7%
at
100
microM
.

Pretreatment
of
the
tissues
with
combined
5-HT1
/
5-HT2
antagonists
,
methysergide
(
1
microM
)
or
methiothepin
(
0
.
1
microM
)
,
significantly
attenuated
the
inhibitory
effect
of
epinastine
on
the
noncholinergic
contraction
.

Pretreatment
with
tropisetron
(
1
microM
)
,
a
5-HT3
antagonist
,
ketanserin
(
10
microM
)
,
a
5-HT2
antagonist
,
thioperamide
(
10
microM
)
,
a
histamine
H3
antagonist
,
or
phentolamine
(
10
microM
)
,
an
alpha-adrenergic
antagonist
,
however
,
had
no
effect
.

Chlorpheniramine
(
10
microM
)
,
another
histamine
H1
receptor
antagonist
without
significant
5-HT
receptor
binding
affinity
,
did
not
produce
any
inhibition
of
the
eNANC
contraction
.

Epinastine
(
100
microM
)
did
not
displace
the
dose-response
curve
to
exogenously
applied
substance
P
(
0
.
01-10
microM
)
.

These
results
suggest
that
epinastine
,
although
identified
as
a
5-HT
antagonist
,
acts
as
a
5-HT1
agonist
and
that
it
inhibits
the
noncholinergic
contraction
in
guinea-pig
airways
through
stimulation
of
a
prejunctional
5-HT1-like
receptor
,
located
to
sensory
nerves

An
overview
on
5alpha-reductase
inhibitors
.
The
'vascular
depression'
hypothesis
has
recently
attracted
significant
research
attention
,
although
the
causal
relationship
between
vascular-related
injuries
and
depression
has
not
been
established
.

Here
,
we
show
that
one
episode
of
cerebral
ischemia
was
sufficient
to
greatly
increase
the
sensitivity
of
rats
to
potentially
depressogenic
events
,
evaluated
at
below-threshold
intensities
in
the
open
space
swim
test
.

The
induced
'ischemic
depression'
was
lasting
and
sensitive
to
an
acute
administration
of
brain-derived
neurotrophic
factor
or
bryostatin-1
,
a
relatively
selective
activator
of
protein
kinase
Cε
,
during
the
induction
phase
.

Chronic
treatment
with
bryostatin-1
(
5
weeks
)
after
the
induction
of
depressive
behavior
reversed
the
depressive
immobility
and
produced
a
lasting
therapeutic
effect
,
which
remained
effective
3
weeks
after
discontinuation
of
the
treatment
.

Similar
treatment
with
alaproclate
,
a
selective
serotonin
reuptake
inhibitor
,
in
contrast
,
produced
temporary
relief
from
the
depressive
symptoms
,
with
the
therapeutic
effect
disappearing
soon
after
the
end
of
the
treatment
.

The
results
strongly
suggest
that
cerebral
ischemia
has
a
direct
role
in
shaping
the
sensitivity
of
an
individual
to
depressogenic
events
and
that
bryostatin-1-like
agents
may
be
developed
as
therapeutics
for
treating
ischemic
depression
in
humans
.
Glucocorticoids
can
cause
steroid-induced
diabetes
or
accelerate
the
progression
to
diabetes
by
creating
systemic
insulin
resistance
and
decreasing
functional
β-cell
mass
,
which
is
influenced
by
changes
in
β-cell
function
,
growth
,
and
death
.

The
synthetic
glucocorticoid
agonist
dexamethasone
(
Dex
)
is
deleterious
to
functional
β-cell
mass
by
decreasing
β-cell
function
,
survival
,
and
proliferation
.

However
,
the
mechanism
by
which
Dex
decreases
β-cell
proliferation
is
unknown
.

Interestingly
,
Dex
induces
the
transcription
of
an
antiproliferative
factor
and
negative
regulator
of
epidermal
growth
factor
receptor
signaling
,
Mig6
(
also
known
as
gene
33
,
RALT
,
and
Errfi1
)
.

We
,
therefore
,
hypothesized
that
Dex
impairs
β-cell
proliferation
by
increasing
the
expression
of
Mig6
and
thereby
decreasing
downstream
signaling
of
epidermal
growth
factor
receptor
.

We
found
that
Dex
induced
Mig6
and
decreased
[
(
3
)
H
]
thymidine
incorporation
,
an
index
of
cellular
replication
,
in
mouse
,
rat
,
and
human
islets
.

Using
adenovirally
delivered
small
interfering
RNA
targeted
to
Mig6
in
rat
islets
,
we
were
able
to
limit
the
induction
of
Mig6
upon
exposure
to
Dex
,
compared
with
islets
treated
with
a
control
virus
,
and
completely
rescued
the
Dex-mediated
impairment
in
replication
.

We
demonstrated
that
both
Dex
and
overexpression
of
Mig6
attenuated
the
phosphorylation
of
ERK1
/
2
and
blocked
the
G
(
1
)
/
S
transition
of
the
cell
cycle
.

In
conclusion
,
Mig6
functions
as
a
molecular
brake
for
β-cell
proliferation
during
glucocorticoid
treatment
in
β-cells
,
and
thus
,
Mig6
may
be
a
novel
target
for
preventing
glucocorticoid-induced
impairments
in
functional
β-cell
mass
.
There
is
evidence
that
high-density
lipoproteins
(
HDLs
)
may
regulate
platelet
function
,
but
disparate
results
exist
regarding
the
effects
of
oxidized
HDLs
on
platelets
.

The
objective
of
our
study
was
to
determine
the
role
of
in
vivo
oxidized
HDLs
on
platelet
aggregation
.

Platelet
aggregation
and
redox
status
were
investigated
in
5
patients
with
abetalipoproteinemia
(
ABLP
)
or
homozygous
hypobetalipoproteinemia
,
two
rare
metabolic
diseases
characterized
by
the
absence
of
apolipoprotein
B-containing
lipoproteins
,
compared
to
5
control
subjects
.

Platelets
isolated
from
plasma
of
patients
with
ABLP
aggregated
4
to
10
times
more
than
control
platelets
,
depending
on
the
agonist
.

By
contrast
,
no
differences
in
the
extent
of
platelet
aggregation
were
observed
between
ABLP
platelet-rich
plasma
(
PRP
)
and
control
PRP
,
suggesting
the
presence
of
a
protective
factor
in
ABLP
plasma
.

ABLP
HDLs
inhibited
agonist-induced
platelet
aggregation
by
binding
to
SR-BI
,
while
control
HDLs
had
no
effect
.

On
the
other
hand
,
lipoprotein-deficient
plasma
from
patients
with
ABLP
did
not
inhibit
platelet
aggregation
.

Severe
oxidative
stress
was
evidenced
in
patients
with
ABLP
.

Compared
to
control
HDLs
,
ABLP
HDLs
showed
a
40%
decrease
of
α-tocopherol
and
an
11-fold
increased
malondialdehyde
concentration
.

These
results
demonstrate
that
in
vivo
oxidized
HDLs
do
not
lose
their
antiaggregatory
properties
despite
oxidation
.

The
neuropeptide
apelin
is
expressed
in
hypothalamic
paraventricular
and
supraoptic
nuclei
and
mediates
its
effects
via
activation
of
the
apelin
receptor
(
APJ
)
.

Evidence
suggests
a
role
for
apelin
and
APJ
in
mediating
the
neuroendocrine
response
to
stress
.

To
understand
the
physiological
role
of
APJ
in
regulation
of
the
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
(
HPA
)
axis
,
we
measured
ACTH
and
corticosterone
(
CORT
)
plasma
levels
in
male
and
female
mice
lacking
APJ
(
APJ
knockout
,
APJ
KO
)
and
in
wild-type
controls
,
in
response
to
a
variety
of
acute
stressors
.

Exposure
to
mild
restraint
,
systemic
injection
of
lipopolysaccharide
(
LPS
)
,
insulin-induced
hypoglycaemia
and
forced
swim
(
FS
)
stressors
,
elevated
plasma
ACTH
and
CORT
levels
in
wild-type
mice
.

Acute
mild
restraint
significantly
increased
plasma
ACTH
and
CORT
to
a
similar
level
in
APJ
KO
mice
as
in
wild-type
mice
.

However
,
an
intact
APJ
was
required
for
a
conventional
ACTH
,
but
not
CORT
,
response
to
LPS
administration
in
male
mice
and
to
insulin-induced
hypoglycaemia
in
male
and
female
mice
.

In
contrast
,
APJ
KO
mice
displayed
an
impaired
CORT
response
to
acute
FS
stress
,
regardless
of
gender
.

These
data
indicate
that
APJ
has
a
role
in
regulation
of
the
HPA
axis
response
to
some
acute
stressors
and
has
a
gender-specific
function
in
peripheral
immune
activation
of
the
HPA
axis

We
present
a

with
an

that
allows
rapid

a
three-hybrid
system
that
enables
the
identification
of
mammalian

We
selected
three
structurally
diverse
pharmacologically
active
compounds
(
tamoxifen
,
reversine
,
and
FK506
)
as
model
baits
.

After

of
these
baits
,
MFCs
were
synthesized
via
a
CuAAC
reaction
,
demonstrating
the
general
applicability
of
the
MTX
reagent
.

In
analytical
mode
,
MASPIT
was
able
to
give
concentration-dependent
reporter
signals
for
the
established
target
proteins
.

Furthermore
,
we
demonstrate
that
the
sensitivity
obtained
with
the
new
MTX
reagent
was
significantly
stronger
than
that
of
a
previously
used
non-regiomeric
conjugate
mixture
.

Finally
,
the
FK506
MFC
was
explored
in
a
cellular
array
screen
for
targets
of
FK506
.

Out
of
a
pilot
collection
of
nearly
2000
full-length
human
ORF
preys
,
FKBP12
,
the
established
target
of
FK506
,
emerged
as
the
prey
protein
that
gave
the
highest
increase
in
luciferase
activity
.

This
indicates
that
our
newly
developed
synthetic
strategy
for
the
straightforward
generation
of
MFCs
is
a
promising
asset
to
uncover

more
effective
in

showed
35%
greater

observed
with

Multiple

Recently

the

potential

duration
,
and
their
importance
in
regulating
the
occurrence
of

have
garnered
more
attention
.

In
particular
,
late
Na
current
(
late

(
Na
)
)
has
been
shown
to
be
important
in
LQT2
and
LQT3
arrhythmias
.

Class

agents
like
dofetilide
,

,
and

,
which
can
all
cause
a

,
significantly
lengthen
action
potential

in

,
and
can
initiate
the
formation

These

can
lead
to
the
development
of
a
serious

,
in

models
and

.

However
,
pretreatment
with

that
block

)
,
like

,
and
RSD1235
,

significantly
attenuates
the

those
induced

,
a
specific
toxin
that
delays
Na
channel

and
amplifies

(

)
greatly
,
mimicking

.

The
Na

block
caused
by
lidocaine
and
RSD1235
can
be
through
the
open
or

These

Analysis
.
Over
the
last
years
,
considerable
progress
has
been
made
for
the
identification
and
characterization
of
drug
transporters
,
and
several
modeling
studies
have
been
undertaken
to
predict
their
effects
on
ADME
profiling
.

Thus
,
this
study
was
focused
on
the
peptide
transporter
hPepT2
,
which
influences
the
regional
pharmacokinetics
in
brain
,
the
reabsorption
from
renal
tubular
fluid
and
the
pulmonary
delivery
.

A
reliable
model
for
hPepT2
was
generated
by
fragments
based
on
the
resolved
structure
of
the
homologue
lactose
permease
LacY
and
the
structure
is
made
available
as
Supplementary
data
.

The
interaction
capacities
of
such
a
model
were
explored
by
docking
a
set
of
75
known
ligands
.

Docking
results
underlined
the
predilection
of
hPepT2
for
highly
hydrophobic
ligands
and
the
key
role
of
ionic
interactions
elicited
by
both
charged
termini
.

The
docking
results
were
further
verified
developing
a
pharmacophore
model
which
clarified
the
key
features
required
for
an
optimal
hPepT2
affinity
and
confirmed
the
main
factors
governing
the
hPepT2
/
hPepT1
selectivity
.

The
soundness
of
the
docking
results
and
the
agreement
with
the
pharmacophore
mapping
afford
an
encouraging
validation
for
the
proposed
hPepT2
model
and
suggest
that
it
can
be
conveniently
exploited
to
design
peptide-like
molecules
with
an
improved

The
dopamine
D4
receptor
,
which
is
considered
a
close
variant
of
the
dopamine
D2
receptor
,
has
recently
been
cloned
.

Receptor
binding
studies
demonstrated
that
clozapine
,
which
is
an
effective
antipsychotic
agent
but
atypical
in
that
it
lacks
the
usual

effects
of

antipsychotic
agents
,
has
high
selectivity
for
the
dopamine
D4
receptor
versus
the
dopamine

.

Comparative
binding

studies
have
been
carried
out
for
a
number
of
interesting
dopaminergic
agents
using
membranes
prepared
from
cloned

It
was

Compounds
with

Overall
,
the
results
with
the
antipsychotic
agents
tested
,
support
the
concept
that
dopamine
D4
receptor
selectivity
may
confer
clozapine-like
antipsychotic
efficacy

furthermore
that

Excessive
level
of
estrogen
is
considered
as
a

therefore
,
many
studies
have
focused

-positive
breast
cancer
,
even
though
ER-negative
cancer
has
a
poor
prognosis
than
ER-positive

.

We
evaluated
the
anti-cancer
effects
of
Ginkgo

extract
(
GBE
)
in
estrogen-independent

GBE

However
,
anti-cancer
effects
of
GBE
on

have
not
been
proved

In
this

,
we
tested
chemotherapeutic
potential
of
GBE
in
the
MDA-MB-231
(
ER-negative
)
human
breast
cancer

line
.

Our
results
showed
that
cytotoxicity
effects
of
GBE
in
MDA-MB-231
lead
to
DNA
fragmentation

high
concentrations
(

Caspase-3
was
significantly
activated
and
mRNA
levels
of

These
results
indicate
that
GBE
induces
apoptosis

NLRP3
inflammasome
has
been
reported
to
be
associated
with
various
kinds
of
immunological
diseases
including
colitis
.

However
,
there
are
few
drug
candidates
targeting
inflammasomes
for
the
treatment
of
colitis
.

In
the
present
study
,
we
aimed
at
examining
the
effect
of

,

Treatment
with

dose-dependently
attenuated

induced
by
DSS
.

In
addition
,
the
disease
activity
index
,
histopathologic

and
myeloperoxidase
activity
were
also
significantly
reduced
by
Fc11a-2
treatment
.

Moreover
,

of
DSS-induced
proinflammatory
cytokines
in
colon
,
including
TNF-α
,
IL-1β
,
IL-18
,
IL-17A
and

,
were
markedly
suppressed
by
Fc11a-2
.

Furthermore
,
a
decreased
CD11c
(
+
)
macrophage
infiltration
in
colons
and
inactivation
of
caspase-1
in
peritoneal
macrophages
were
detected
in
Fc11a-2-treated
mice
.

The
mechanism
of
action
of
Fc11a-2
was
related
to
the
inhibition
of
the
cleavage
of
pro-caspase-1
,
pro-IL-1β
and
pro-IL-18
which
in
turn
suppressed
the
activation
of
NLRP3
inflammasome
.

Taken
together
,
our
results
demonstrate
the
ability
of
Fc11a-2
to
inhibit
NLRP3
inflammasome
activation
and
its
potential
use
in
the
treatment
of

The

agonists
is
hypogonadism
,
a
major
cause
of

Consistent
with
this
observation
,
GnRH
agonists
increase
bone
turnover
and
decrease
bone
mineral
density
,
a
surrogate
for
fracture
risk
.

Large
claims-based
analyses

other
retrospective

provide
compelling
evidence
that
GnRH

increase
risk
of
clinical
fractures
.

Estrogens
play
a
central
role
in
homeostasis
of
the
normal

,
and
estrogen
deficiency

to
be
primarily
responsible

the
adverse

the
striatum
of
the
aged
Fischer
344
(
F344
)
rat
,
yet
the
mechanism
underlying
this
phenomenon
is
unknown
.

The
current
study
utilized
in
vivo
electrochemical
recordings
,
immunoblotting
and
biotinylation
in
young
(
6
months
)
,
late-middle
aged
(
18
months
)
and
aged
(
24
months
)
F344
rats
to
elucidate
the
potential
role
that
glutamate
transporters
(
GLT-1
,
GLAST
,
and
EAAC1
)
may
play
in
this
mechanism
.

Here
we
show
that
the
time
necessary
to
clear
glutamate
from
the
late-middle
aged
and
aged
striatum
is
significantly
prolonged
in
comparison
to
the
young
striatum
.

In
addition
,
an
analysis
of
various
sub-regions
of
the
striatum
revealed
a
marked
dorsoventral
gradient
in
terms
of
glutamate
clearance
times
in
the
aged
striatum
,
a
phenomenon
which
was
not
present
in
the
striatum
of
the
animals
of
the
remaining
age
groups
.

We
also
found
that
the
decreased
glutamate
clearance
time
observed
in
the
late-middle
aged
and
aged
rats
is
not
due
to
a
decrease
in
the
production
of
total
transporter
protein
among
these
three
transporters
.

Rather
,
a
significant
reduction
in
the
amount
of
GLAST
expressed
on
the
plasma
membrane
surface
in
the
aged
animals
(
approximately
55%
when
compared
to
young
rats
)
may
contribute
to
this
phenomenon
.

These
age-related
alterations
in
extracellular
l-glutamate
regulation
may
be
key
contributors
to
the
increased
susceptibility
of
the
aged
brain
to
excitotoxic
insults
such
as
stroke
and
hypoxia
.
Investigations
conducted
over
the
past
3
decades
have
demonstrated
that
serotonergic
receptors
,
specifically
the
5-HT2A
and
5-HT2C
subtypes
,
play
an
important
role
in
the
behavioral
effects
of
hallucinogenic
compounds
.

The
present
study
was
designed
to
determine
the
respective
significance
of
these
two
receptors
in
the
stimulus
effects
of
LSD
and
(

)
DOM
in
the
rat
.

Specifically
,
the
interactions
of
a
series
of
serotonergic
antagonists
(
risperidone
,
pirenpirone
,
metergoline
,
ketanserin
,

,

,
pizotyline
,
spiperone
,
cyprohepatadine
,

,
and
thioridazine
)
with
the
LSD
stimulus
and
the
(
-
)
DOM
stimulus
in
LSD-trained
subjects
was
defined
.

From
these
data
,
IC50
values
were
determined
for
the
inhibition
of
the
LSD-appropriate
responding
elicited
by
either
0

LSD
(
15-min

)
or
0

4
mg

)
DOM
(
75-min
pretreatment
)
.

In
addition
,
the
affinities
of
these
antagonists
for
5-HT2A
and
5-HT2C
receptors
were
determined
in
radioligand
competition
studies
,
5-HT2A
affinity
correlated
significantly
with
IC50
values
for
the
blockade
of
the
LSD
(
r

in
the

subjects
.

5-HT2C
affinity
did
not
correlate
significantly
with
either
series
of
IC50
values
.

These
data
indicate
that
(

the
stimulus
effects
of
LSD
,
and
(

)
the
substitution
of
(

are

The

(

products
of
the
parasitic

were
found
to
modify
the
in

proliferation
of
the
tumorous
colic
HT29-D4
cell
line
of
epithelial
origin
.

A
characteristic
feature
of
these
E-S
products
is
the
presence
of
a
high
level
of
acetylcholinesterase
(
AChE
)
activity
,
the
biological
significance
of
which
remains
unclear
.

To
determine
a
possible
role
of
AChE
on
cell
growth
,
the
enzyme
was
purified
from
E-S
products
using
edrophonium
chloride
.

Purity
was
confirmed
by
polyacrylamide
gel
electrophoresis
,
using
silver
and
Karnovsky
stains
,
before
assessing
its
effects
on
cell
proliferation
.

The
purified
AChE
was
incorporated
at
different
concentrations
in
a
culture
medium
of
HT29-D4
cells
.

A
mitogenic
effect
was
shown
for
low
concentrations
(
0
.
1-14
units
)
.

By
contrast
,
an
inhibitory
effect
was
noted
at
high
concentrations
(
35-1400
units
)
.

Furthermore
,
polyclonal
antibodies
were
prepared
and
depletion
of
AChE
in
E-S
products
by
immunoprecipitation
or
affinity
chromatography
resulted
in
a
partial
or
total
disappearance
of
the
stimulatory
effect
of
cell
growth
.

Thus
,
the
results

suggest
a
modulatory

,
while

An
antibody
generated
against
the

inhibited

,
while
no

observed
.

Furthermore
,
binding
of
125I-factor

to

was
inhibited
by
molar
excess
of
unlabeled
factor
Xa
,
but
not
by

An
article
presented
in
this
issue
of
Molecular
Pharmacology
(
p
.

1527
)
provides
an
intriguing
example
of
how
tyrosine
kinase
inhibitors
can
be
put
to
many
uses
.

In
this
article
,
the
action
of
dasatinib
(
BMS-354825
)
is
contrasted
with
that
of
imatinib
,
a
kinase
inhibitor
that
is
currently
being
used
to
treat
chronic
myelogenous
leukemia
and
other
disorders
.

Both
pharmacologic
inhibitors
target
several
tyrosine
kinases
,
including
Bcr-Abl
and
the
platelet-derived
growth
factor
receptor
(
PDGFR
)
.

Up
to
this
point
,
the
PDGFR
has
not
been
a
primary
therapeutic
target
for
this
class
of
agents
.

The
work
of
Chen
and
colleagues
shows
that
dasatinib
is
a
particularly
potent
inhibitor
of
PDGFR
and
that
the
compound
also
targets
Src
kinase
.

The
authors
suggest
that
this
combination
of
activities
could
be
useful
in
the
treatment
of
vascular
obstructive
diseases
.

Although
a
lack
of
absolute
specificity
has
typically
been
regarded
as
a
pharmacologic
drawback
,
this
study
exemplifies
how
drugs
with
multiple
molecular
targets
can
potentially
provide
a
very
beneficial
spectrum
of
therapeutic
activities
in
multiple

Control
of

Although
reducing
LDL
cholesterol
(
LDL-c
)
levels
decreases
morbidity
and
mortality
,
this
therapeutic
intervention
only
translates
into
a
25-40%
reduction
in
cardiovascular
events
.

Epidemiological
studies
have
shown
that
a
high
LDL-c
level
is
not
the
only
risk
factor
for
CAD;
low
HDL
cholesterol
(
HDL-c
)
is
an
independent
risk
factor
for
CAD
.

Apolipoprotein
A-I
(
ApoA-I
)
is
the
major
protein
component
of
HDL-c
that
mediates
reverse
cholesterol
transport
from
tissues
to
the
liver
for
excretion
.

Therefore
,
increasing
ApoA-I
levels
is
an
attractive
strategy
for
HDL-c
elevation
.

Using

was
identified
as
the
molecular

we
show
that

(

,
two
related
molecules
previously
used
as
anti-inflammatory
drugs
,
act

Both

by
causing
a

shift
of
the
voltage

curve
(
-23

,
respectively
)
and
by

The
effects
of
the
drugs
were
stronger
on
KCNQ2

on

subunits
.

In
contrast
,
they
did
not
enhance

Both

increased
KCNQ2

current
amplitude
at

led
to

meclofenamate

enhanced

Of

,
CYP2D

were
the
most
efficient
in
catalyzing

of
metabolizing
5-methoxytryptamine
to
serotonin
.

The
reaction
was
inhibited
by
the
specific
CYP2D
inhibitors
quinine
and
fluoxetine
.

Human
liver
microsomes
of
the
wild-type
CYP2D6
metabolized
5-methoxytryptamine
to
serotonin
more
effectively
than
did
the
defective
CYP2D6*4*4
ones
.

The
obtained
results
indicate
that
rat
brain
CYP2D
isoforms
catalyze
the
formation
of
serotonin
from
5-methoxytryptamine
,
and
that
the
deficit
or
genetic
defect
of
CYP2D
may
affect
serotonin
metabolism
in
the
brain
.

The
results
are
discussed
in
the
context
of
their
possible
physiological
and
pharmacological
significance
in
vivo
.
Ample
evidence
suggests
that
many
of
the
in
vivo
anti-metastatic
effects
by
heparins
reflect
their
actions
on
P-selectin-mediated
binding
.

We
hypothesized
that
the
ability
of
widely
used
heparins
and
derivatives
to
interfere
with
P-selectin-dependent
tumour
cell
interactions
under
flow
in
vitro
could
be
used
to
identify
anticoagulants
with
advanced
inhibitory
functions
on
experimental
blood-borne
metastasis
in
vivo
.

To
test
this
assumption
,
the
impact
of
unfractionated
heparin
,
the
low-molecular-weight
heparins
(
LMWH
)
nadroparin
and
enoxaparin
,
and
the
synthetic
pentasaccharide
fondaparinux
on
P-selectin-dependent
tumour
interactions
in
vitro
and
metastasis
formation
in
vivo
were
evaluated
.

Our
data
revealed
that
these
commonly
used
anticoagulants
widely
differ
in
their
potential
to
interfere
with
P-selectinmediated
cell
binding
.

Importantly
,
the
superior
inhibitory
capacity
on
P-selectin
function
of
unfractionated
heparin
and
LMWH
nadroparin
as
opposed
to
LMWH
enoxaparin
and
synthetic
heparin
pentasaccharide
fondaparinux
strongly
correlated
to
the
inhibitory
potency
of
each
in
inhibiting
experimental
lung
metastasis
in
vivo
.

Hence
,
P-selectin
inhibition
may
constitute
a
valuable
feature
to
identify
anticoagulants
that
are
suitable
for
anticancer
therapy
.

Replacement

pairs

in
differences
in
inhibition
constants
(
Ki
)
in

as
well
as
marked
differences
in
rat
intravenous
pharmacokinetic
profiles
.

The
difference
in
pharmacokinetic
profiles
between
lower
and
higher
affinity
inhibitors
(
LAIs
and
HAIs
,
respectively
)
was
characterized
by
remarkably
different
estimates
for
steady-state
volumes
of
distribution
(
Vss
:
1
.
8
to
2

0
versus
10
to
13
L

)
with
comparable
clearance
estimates
(
3
.
2
to
3
.
5
L
/
h
/
kg
)
.

When
the
observed
Vss
estimates
were
compared
to
the
values
predicted
with
the
tissue-composition-based
model
,
the
observed
Vss
estimates
for
HAIs
were
4
to
8-fold
larger
than
the
predicted
values
whereas
the
Vss
values
for
LAIs
were
comparable
each
other
.

Accordingly
,
a
negative
relationship
between
in
vitro
HSP90
Ki
versus
in
vivo
Vss
estimates
was
observed
among
these
inhibitors
.

We
therefore
hypothesized
that
pharmacokinetic
profiles
of
these
inhibitors
could
be
characterized
by
target-mediated
drug
disposition
(
TMDD
)
model
.

In
vivo
equilibrium
dissociation
constant
(
KD
)
estimates
for
HAIs
due
to
target
binding
by
TMDD
model
with
rapid
binding
approximation
were
1
to
6
nM
(
equivalent
to
0
.
3
to
2
nM
free
drug
)
,
which
appeared
comparable
to
the
in
vitro
Ki
estimates
(
2
to
3
nM
)
.

In
vivo
KD
values
of
LAIs
were
not
accurately
determined
by
the
TMDD
model
,
likely
due
to
non-specific
binding
dependent-tissue
distribution
obscuring
TMDD
profiles
.

Overall
,
these
results
suggest
that
the
observed
large
Vss
estimates
for
potent
HSP90
inhibitors
are
likely
due
to
pharmacological
target
binding
.

The
present
article
describes
the
purification
and
biophysical
characterization
of
the
mitochondrial
creatine
kinase
isoenzyme
from
chicken
brain
(
Mia-CK
)
.

Gel
permeation
chromatography
,
direct
mass
measurements
of
individual
molecules
by
scanning
transmission
electron
microscopy
,
and
analytical
ultracentrifugation
confirmed
the
existence
of
two
different
oligomeric
forms
,
dimeric
and
octameric
Mia-CK
,
with
molecular
masses
of
85
kDa
and
306-352
kDa

with
sedimentation
constants
of

.

and

S
,
respectively
.

In
addition
,
it
was
tested
if
Mia-
and
Mib-CK
can
form
heterodimeric
and
heterooctameric
molecules
with
subunits
of
other
CK
isoenzymes
.

By
denaturation
in
urea
or
guanidine
hydrochloride
and
subsequent
renaturation
,
MiaMib-CK
and
surprisingly
also
MiaM-CK
heterodimers
could
be
generated
.

In
contrast
,
no
heterodimers
were
obtained
between
Mib-
and
M-
or
B-CK
.

Furthermore
,
reoctamerization
of
a
mixture
of
Mia-
and
Mib-CK
homodimers
led
to
the
formation
of
MiaMib-CK
heterooctamers
.

In
these
heterooctamers
,
the
Mia-
and
Mib-CK
homodimers
remained
the
fundamental
building
blocks
.

No
subunit
exchange
between
adjacent
dimers
within
the
heterooctamer
could
be
observed
even
after
storage
for
3
months
at
4
degrees
C
.

The
relevance
of
these
data
on
the
structural
organization
of
the
Mi-CK
octamer
and
on
the
physiological
aspects
of
tissue-specific
isoenzyme
expression
are
discussed
.

Human
nuclear
uracil-DNA
glycosylase
UNG2
is
essential
for
post-replicative
repair
of
uracil
in
DNA
,
and
UNG2
protein
and
mRNA
levels
rapidly
decline
in
G2
/
M
phase
.

Previous
work
has
demonstrated
regulation
of
UNG2
at
the
transcriptional
level
,
as
well
as
by
protein
phosphorylation
and
ubiquitylation
.

UNG2
mRNA
,
encoded
by
the
UNG
gene
,
contains
a
long
3'untranslated
region
(
3'UTR
)
of
previously
unknown
function
.

Here
,
we
demonstrate
that
several
conserved
regions
in
the
3'UTR
are
potential
seed
sites
for
microRNAs
(
miRNAs
)
,
such
as
miR-16
,
miR-34c
,
and
miR-199a
.

Our
results
show
that
these
miRNAs
down-regulate
UNG
activity
,
UNG
mRNA
,
and
UNG
protein
levels
.

Down-regulation
was
dependent
on
the
3'UTR
,
indicating
that
the
miRNAs
directly
target
the
conserved
seed
sites
in
the
3'UTR
.

These
results
add
miRNAs
as
a
new
modality
to
UNG's
increasing
list
of
complex
regulatory
mechanisms
.
The

been
studied
by
monitoring
tyrosine
burial
and
2'-cytidine

The
folding
rate
for
wild-type
RNase
A
is
faster
in
the
presence
of
the
inhibitor
2'CMP
than
in
its
absence
,
indicating
that
the
transition-state
structure
in
the
rate-determining
step
is
stabilized
by
2'CMP
.

The
folding
rate
monitored
by
2'CMP
binding
to
the
major
slow-folding
species
of
Pro42Ala
RNase
A
is
faster
than
the
folding
rate
monitored
by
tyrosine
burial;
however
,
the
folding
rate
monitored
by
inhibitor
binding
to
the
minor
slow-folding
species
is
decreased
significantly
over
the
folding
rate
monitored
by
tyrosine
burial
,
indicating
that
the
major
and
minor
slow-folding
species
of
Pro42Ala
fold
to
the
native
state
with
different
transition-state
conformations
in
the

The
expression
of

receptor

)
in
breast
cancer
correlates
with
metastatic
disease
progression
compared
with
the
expression
of
full-length
p185ErbB2
.

We
now
show
that
heregulin
(
HRG
)
,
but
not
EGF
,
stimulates
p95ErbB2
phosphorylation
in
BT474
breast
cancer
cells
.

Furthermore
,
phospho-p95ErbB2
forms
heterodimers
with
ErbB3
,
but
not
EGFR
,
while
p185ErbB2
heterodimerizes
with
both
EGFR
and
ErbB3
.

The
predilection
of
p95ErbB2
to
heterodimerize
with
ErbB3
provides
an
explanation
for
its
regulation
by
HRG
,
an
ErbB3
ligand
.

GW572016
,
a
reversible
small

inhibitor
of
EGFR
and
ErbB2
tyrosine
kinases
,
inhibits
baseline
p95ErbB2
phosphorylation
in
BT474
cells
and
tumor
xenografts
.

Inhibition
of
p95ErbB2
,
p185ErbB2
,
and
EGFR
phosphorylation
by
GW572016
resulted
in
the
inhibition
of
downstream
phospho-Erk1
/
2
,
phospho-AKT
,
and
cyclin
D
steady-state
protein
levels
.

Increased
phosphorylation
of
p95ErbB2
and
AKT
in
response
to
HRG
was
abrogated
to
varying
degrees
by
GW572016
.

In
contrast
,
trastuzumab
did
not
inhibit
p95ErbB2
phosphorylation
or
the
expression
of
downstream
phospho-Erk1
/
2
,
phospho-AKT
,
or
cyclin
D
.

It
is
tempting
to
speculate
that
trastuzumab
resistance
may
be
mediated
in
part
by
the
selection
of
p95ErbB2-expressing
breast
cancer
cells
capable
of
exerting
potent
growth
and
prosurvival
signals
through
p95ErbB2-ErbB3
heterodimers
.

Thus
,
p95ErbB2
represents
a
target
for
therapeutic
intervention
,
and
one
that
is
sensitive
to
GW572016
therapy

Fanconi
Anemia
(
FA
)
is
a
rare
genetic
disorder
associated
with
a
bone-marrow
failure
,
cancer
predisposition
and
hypersensitivity
to
DNA
crosslinking
agents
.

Majority
of
the
15
FA
genes
and
encoded
proteins
characterized
so
far
are
integrated
into
DNA
repair
pathways
,
however
,
other
important
functions
cannot
be
excluded
.

FA
cells
are
sensitive
to
oxidants
,
and
accumulation
of
oxidized
proteins
has
been
characterized
for
several
FA
subgroups
.

Clinical
phenotypes
of
both
FA
and
other
closely
related
diseases
suggest
altered
functions
of
mitochondria
,
organelles
responsible
for
cellular
energetic
metabolism
,
and
also
serving
as
an
important
producer
and
the
most
susceptible
target
from
reactive
oxidative
species
(
ROS
)
.

In
this
study
,
we
have
shown
that
elevated
level
of
mitochondrial
ROS
in
FA
cells
is
in
parallel
with
the
decrease
of
mitochondrial
membrane
potential
,
the
decrease
of
ATP
production
,
impaired
oxygen
uptake
and
pathological
changes
in
the
morphology
of
mitochondria
.

This
is
accompanied
by
inactivation
of
enzymes
that
are
essential
for
the
energy
production
(
F1F0ATPase
and
cytochrome
C
oxidase
)
and
detoxification
of
ROS
(

SOD1
)

In
turn
,
overexpression
of
SOD1
could
rescue
oxygen
consumption

Importantly
,
the
depletion
of

that

of

On

we
propose
that

lead

Ecological
studies
in
Taiwan
,
Chile
,
Argentina
,
Bangladesh
,
and
Mexico
have
confirmed
significant
dose-dependent
associations
between
ingestion
of
arsenic-contaminated
drinking
water
and
the
risk
of
various
human
malignancies
.

The
FHIT
and
WWOX
genes
are
active
in
common
fragile
sites
FRA3B
and
FRA16D
,
respectively
.

Reduced
expression
of
FHIT
or
WWOX
is
known
to
be
an
early
indicator
of
carcinogen-induced
cancers
.

However
,
the
effect
of
arsenite
on
the
expressions
and
molecular
mechanisms
of
these
markers
is
still
unclear
.

The
aims
of
this
study
were
(
i
)
to
observe
the
expression
of
ATR
,
WWOX
and
FHIT
proteins
in
urothelial
carcinoma
(
UC
)
between
endemic
and
non-endemic
areas
of
blackfoot
disease
(
BFD
)
by
immunohistochemical
analyses;
(
ii
)
to
compare
expression
of
these
genes
between
arsenite-treated
SV-HUC-1
human
epithelial
cells
and
rat
uroepithelial
cells;
and
(
iii
)
to
determine
the
role
of
DNMT
and
MEK
inhibitors
on
expressions
of
WWOX
and
FHIT
in
response
to
arsenite
in
SV-HUC-1
.

The
experiments
revealed
that
expressions
of
ATR
,
WWOX
and
FHIT
in
UC
significantly
differed
between
BFD
areas
and
non-BFD
areas
(
p
=
0
.
003
,
0
.
009
and
0
.
021
,
respectively
)
.

In
fact
,
the
results
for
the
arsenite-treated
groups
showed
that
ATR
,
WWOX
and
FHIT
are
downregulated
by
arsenite
in
SV-HUC-1
.

However
,
the
inhibitors
suppressed
the
effects
of
arsenite
on
WWOX
and
FHIT
proteins
and
mRNA
expression
.

In
conclusion
,
arsenite
decreased
expressions
of
ATR
,
WWOX
and
FHIT
via
ERK1
/
2
activation
in
SV-HUC-1
cells
.

These
findings
confirm
that
dysregulations
of
these
markers
may
contribute
to
arsenite-induced
carcinogenesis
.
Molecular
mechanism
of
terbinafine

in
Saccharomyces
cerevisiae
.
The
development
of
cortical
neurons
in
vivo
and
in
vitro
is
accompanied
by
alterations
in
NMDA
receptor
subunit
expression
and
concomitant
modifications
in
the
pharmacological
profile
of
NMDA-activated
ionic
currents
.

For
example
,
we
observed
that
with
decreasing
NR2B
/
NR2A
subunit
expression
ratio
,
the
block
of
NMDA
receptor-mediated
whole-cell
responses
by
the
NR2B-selective
antagonist
haloperidol
was
also
decreased
.

In
mature
cultures
(
>22
d
in
vitro
)
,
however
,
NMDA
responses
obtained
from
excised
nucleated
macropatches
,
which
comprised
a
large
portion
of
the
soma
,
remained
strongly
antagonized
by
haloperidol
.

These
results
suggest
that
in
more
mature
neurons
NR1
/
NR2B
receptors
appear
to
be
preferentially
expressed
in
the
cell
body
.

As
predicted
from
the
whole-cell
recording
pharmacological
profile
,
NMDA-induced
toxicity
was
largely
unaffected
by
haloperidol
in
mature
cultures
.

However
,
haloperidol
effectively
blocked
glutamate
toxicity
in
the
same
cultures
,
suggesting
that
the
neurotoxic
actions
of
this
amino
acid
were
mostly
due
to
the
activation
of
somatic
NMDA
receptors
.

In
experiments
in
which
the
potency
of
glutamate
toxicity
was
increased
by
the
transport
inhibitor
l-trans-pyrrolidine-2
,
4-dicarboxylic
acid
,
the
neuroprotective
effects
of
haloperidol
were
significantly
diminished
.

This
was
likely
because
of
the
fact
that
glutamate
,
now
toxic
at
much
lower
concentrations
,
was
able
to
reach
and
activate
dendritic
receptors
under
these
conditions
.

These
results
strongly
argue
that
exogenous
glutamate
and
NMDA
normally
induce
excitotoxicity
at
distinct
cellular
locations
in
mature
mixed
neuronal
cultures
and
that
NR1
/
NR2B
receptors
remain
an
important
component
in
the
expression
of
glutamate
,
but
not
NMDA-induced
excitotoxicity
.
A
single-nucleotide
polymorphism
(
SNP
)
in
the
α5
nicotinic
acetylcholine
receptor
subunit
gene
,
rs16969968
,
has
been
repeatedly
associated
with
both
smoking
and
respiratory
health
phenotypes
.

However
,
there
remains
considerable
debate
as
to
whether
associations
with
lung
cancer
are
mediated
through
effects
on
smoking
behavior
.

Preclinical
studies
suggest
that
α5
receptor
subunit
expression
and
function
may
have
a
direct
role
in
nicotine
titration
during
self
administration
.

The
present
study
investigated
the
association
of
CHRNA5
polymorphisms
and
smoking
topography
in
66
smokers
asked
to
smoke
four
nicotine-containing
(
nicotine
yield
=
0
.
60
mg
)
and
four
placebo
(
nicotine
yield
<0
.
05
mg
)
cigarettes
,
during
separate
experimental
sessions
.

Genotype
at
rs16969968
predicted
nicotine
titration
,
with
homozygotes
for
the
major
allele
(
G
:
G
)
displaying
significantly
reduced
puff
volume
in
response
to
nicotine
,
whereas
minor
allele
carriers
(
A
:
G
or
A
:
A
)
produced
equivalent
puff
volumes
for
placebo
and
nicotine
cigarettes
.

The
present
results
suggest
that
puff
volume
may
be
a
more
powerful
objective
phenotype
of
smoking
behavior
than
self-reported
cigarettes
per
day
and
nicotine
dependence
.

Further
,
these
results
suggest
that
the
association
between
rs16969968
and
lung
cancer
may
be
mediated
by
the
quantity
of
smoke
inhaled
.

We
evaluated
the
pharmacokinetics

pharmacodynamics
of
oral
MK-462
in
comparison
with
oral
sumatriptan
in
healthy
male
volunteers
.

METHODS
:
Sixteen
healthy

volunteers
were
studied
in
a
rising
,
single
dose
,
alternating
panel
design
with
eight
subjects
per
panel
.

Matching

was
administered
to
two
of
eight
study
subjects
at
each
dose
level
of
MK-462
in
a
randomized
,
double-blind
fashion
.

RESULTS
:
MK-462
was
rapidly
absorbed
with
a
median
tmax
of
1

h
(
range
1-3

.

Administration
of
either
MK-462
or
sumatriptan
produced
maximal
mean
elevations
of
5-10
mmHg
in
systolic
and
diastolic
blood
pressures
without
effect
on
heart
rate;
the
changes
occurred
sooner
following
MK-462
,
consistent
with
more
rapid
absorption
.

Both
MK-462
and
sumatriptan
provoked
mild
increases
in
serum
growth
hormone
without
any
effect
on
serum
prolactin
concentrations
.

The
most
commonly
reported
symptom
following
MK-462
was
drowsiness
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
These
results
indicate
that
the
novel
5-HT1D
agonist
,
MK-462
,
is
rapidly
absorbed
following
oral
administration
and
warrants
further
investigation
of
its

in
the

This
study
was
designed
to
investigate
the
potential

The

was
successfully
established
through

As
revealed

,

treatments
significantly
resulted
in
down-regulation
of
blood
glucose
and
insulin
levels
in
serum
,
while
the
levels
of
oxidative
stress
markers
were
markedly
lowered
through
ELISA
assay
.

Meanwhile
,
the
pathological
damage
in
islet
with
pancreatic
beta
cells
was
ameliorated
by
treatment
of
CPS
at
different
doses
,
as
shown
in

At
the

time
,
the
treatments
also
caused
notable
reduction
of
iNOS

NF-κB
expressions
showing
in
Western

These
findings
demonstrate
that
cinnamon
polyphenols
can
exert
the
hypoglycemic
and
hypolipidemic
effects
through
the
mechanisms
that
may
be
associated
with
repairing

Silymarin
has
been
known
to
exert
antioxidant
,
anti-carcinogenic
and
anti-inflammatory
effects
.

In
this
study
,
we
examined
the
effect
of
silymarin
on
gastritis
in
rats
.

Oral
administration
of
silymarin
dose-dependently
decreased
gastric
lesions
in
ethanol-induced
gastritis
model
.

Silymarin
also
significantly
suppressed
the
development
of
gastric
lesions
in
aspirin-
or
water
immersion-restraint
stress-induced
gastritis
models
.

Further
study
demonstrated
that
the
gastroprotective
effect
of
silymarin
was
blocked
by
nitric
oxide
(
NO
)
synthase
inhibitor
l-NAME
,
SH
blocker
N-ethylmaleimide
or
TRPV1
antagonist
capsazepine
in

In
addition
,
ex

analysis
revealed
that
ethanol-induced
decrease
in
gastric
mucus
and
non-protein
sulfhydryl

NPSH
)
groups
was
significantly
reversed
by
silymarin
treatment
and
lipid
peroxidation
was
also
suppressed
by
silymarin
in
ethanol-induced
gastritis
model
.

Taken
together
,
these
results
suggest
that
silymarin
exerts
gastroprotective
effects
and
the
gastroprotective
effects
of
silymarin
might
be
related
to
the
protection
of
gastric
mucosal
NO
and
NP-SH
and
the
modulation
of

Previous
studies
in
our
laboratory
have
shown
that
the
phase
III
efflux
transporter
multidrug-resistance
protein
(
MRP
)
1
can
act
synergistically
with
the
phase
II
conjugating
glutathione
S-transferases
(
GST
)
to
confer
resistance
to
the
toxicities
of
some
electrophilic
drugs
and
carcinogens
.

To
determine
whether
the
distinct
efflux
transporter
MRP2
could
also
potentiate
GST-mediated
protection
from
electrophilic
toxins
,
we
examined
the
effect
of
regulatable
GSTP1-1
expression
in
MRP2-rich
HepG2
cells
on
4-nitroquinoline
1-oxide
(
4NQO
)
-induced
cytotoxicity
and
genotoxicity
(
nucleic-acid
adduct
formation
)
.

Expression
of
GSTP1-1
was
associated
with
a
fourfold
to
tenfold
protection
from
4NQO-induced
cytotoxicity
.

Inhibition
of
MRP2-mediated
efflux
activity

A
completely
reversed
GSTP1-1-associated
resistance-a
result
indicating
that
GSTP1-1-mediated
cytoprotection
is
absolutely
dependent
on
MRP2
efflux
activity
.

Moreover
,
MRP2
efflux
activity
also
augmented
GSTP1-1-mediated
protection
from
4NQO-induced
nucleic-acid
adduct
formation
.

We
conclude
that
MRP2-mediated
efflux
of
the
glutathione
conjugate
of
4NQO
and
/
or
another
toxic
derivative
of
4NQO
is
required
to
support
GSTP1-1-associated
protection
from
4NQO
toxicities
in
HepG2
cells

The
neurosteroid
pregnenolone
sulphate
(
PS
)
potentiates
N-methyl-D-aspartate
(
NMDA
)
receptor
mediated
responses
in
various
neuronal
preparations
.

The
NR1
subunit
can
combine
with
NR2A
,
NR2B
,
NR2C
,
or
NR2D
subunits
to
form
functional
receptors
.

Differential
NR2
subunit
expression
in
brain
and
during
development
raises
the
question
of
how
the
NR2
subunit
influences
NMDA
receptor
modulation
by
neuroactive
steroids
.

2
.

We
examined
the
effects
of
PS
on
the
four
diheteromeric
NMDA
receptor
subtypes
generated
by
co-expressing
the
NR1
(
100
)
subunit
with
each
of
the
four
NR2
subunits
in
Xenopus
oocytes
.

Whereas
PS
potentiated
NMDA-
,
glutamate-
,
and
glycine-induced
currents
of
NR1
/
NR2A
and
NR1
/
NR2B
receptors
,
it
was
inhibitory
at
NR1

receptors
.

In
contrast
,
pregnanolone
sulphate
(
3alpha5betaS
)
,
a
negative
modulator
of
the
NMDA
receptor
that
acts
at
a
distinct
site
from
PS
,
inhibited
all
four
subtypes
,
but
was
approximately
4
fold
more
potent
at
NR1
/
NR2C
and
NR1
/
NR2D
than
at
NR1
/
NR2A
and
NR1
/
NR2B
receptors
.

.

These
findings
demonstrate
that
residues
on
the
NR2
subunit
are
key
determinants
of
modulation
by
PS
and
3alpha5betaS
.

The
modulatory
effects
of
PS
,
but
not
3alpha5betaS
,
on
dose-response
curves
for
NMDA
,
glutamate
,
and
glycine
are
consistent
with
a
two-state
model
in
which
PS
either
stabilizes
or
destabilizes
the
active
state
of
the
receptor
,
depending
upon
which
NR2
subunit
is
present
.

.

The
selectivity
of
sulphated
steroid
modulators
for
NMDA
receptors
of
specific
subunit
composition
is
consistent
with
a
neuromodulatory
role
for
endogenous
sulphated
steroids
.

The
results
indicate
that
it
may
be
possible
to
develop
therapeutic
agents
that
target
steroid
modulatory
sites

specific
NMDA

Incoherent
neutron
scattering
is
one
of
the
most
powerful
tools
for
studying
dynamics
in
biological
matter
.

Using
the
cold

spectrometer
IN16
at
the
Institut
Laue
Langevin
(
ILL
,

)
,
temperature

(

and
recombinant
mouse
acetylcholinesterase
:
mAChE
)
was
examined
using
elastic
incoherent
neutron
scattering
(
EINS
)
.

The
dynamics
was
characterized
by
the
averaged
atomic
mean
square
displacement
(
MSD
)
,
associated
with
the
sample
flexibility
at
a
given
temperature
.

We
found
MSD
values
of
hAChE
above
the
dynamical
transition
temperature
(
around
200K
)
larger
than
for
mAChE
and
hBChE
,
implying
that
hAChE
is
more
flexible
than
the
other
ChEs
.

Activation

for
thermodynamical

were
extracted
through
the
frequency
window
model
(
FWM
)
(
Becker

)
[

]
and
turned
out
to
increase
from
hBChE
to
mAChE
and
finally
to
hAChE
,
inversely
to
the
MSDs
relations
.

Between
280
and
316K
,
catalytic
studies
of
these
enzymes
were
carried
out
using
thiocholine
esters
:
at
the
same
temperature
,
the
hAChE
activity
was
systematically
higher
than
the
mAChE
or
hBChE
ones
.

Our
results
thus
suggest
a
strong
correlation
between
dynamics
and
activity
within
the
ChE
family
.

We
also

the
dynamics
was
observed
,
thus
suggesting
that
relations
between
enzyme
dynamics
and
catalytic
stability
are
more
complex
.

Finally
,
the
possible
relation
between
flexibility
and
protein
ability
to
grow
in
crystals
is
discussed
.
Half
a
century
ago
,
thalidomide
was
widely
prescribed
to
pregnant
women
as
a
sedative
but
was
found
to
be
teratogenic
,
causing
multiple
birth
defects
.

Today
,
thalidomide
is
still
used
in
the
treatment
of
leprosy
and
multiple
myeloma
,
although
how
it
causes
limb
malformation
and
other
developmental
defects
is
unknown
.

Here
,
we
identified
cereblon
(
CRBN
)
as
a
thalidomide-binding
protein
.

CRBN
forms
an
E3
ubiquitin
ligase
complex
with
damaged
DNA
binding
protein
1
(
DDB1
)
and
Cul4A
that
is
important
for
limb
outgrowth
and
expression
of
the
fibroblast
growth
factor
Fgf8
in
zebrafish
and
chicks
.

Thalidomide
initiates
its
teratogenic
effects
by
binding
to
CRBN
and
inhibiting
the
associated
ubiquitin
ligase
activity
.

This
study
reveals
a
basis
for
thalidomide
teratogenicity
and
may
contribute
to
the
development
of
new
thalidomide
derivatives
without
teratogenic
activity
.
We
report
on
the
inhibitory
activity
of
the
NSAIDs
meloxicam
,
carprofen
,
phenylbutazone
and
flunixin
,
on
blood
cyclooxygenases
in
the
horse
using
in
vitro
enzyme-linked
assays
.

As
expected
,
comparison
of
IC50
indicated
that
meloxicam
and
carprofen
are
more
selective
inhibitors
of
COX-2
than
phenylbutazone
and
flunixin;
meloxicam
was
the
most
advantageous
for
horses
of
four
NSAIDs
examined
.

However
at
IC80
,
phenylbutazone
(
+
134
.
4%
)
and
flunixin
(
+
29
.
7%
)
had
greater
COX-2
selectivity
than
at
IC50
,
and
meloxicam
(
-41
.
2%
)
and
carprofen
(
-12
.
9%
)
had
lower
COX-2
selectivity
than
at
IC50
.

We
therefore
propose
that
the
selectivity
of
NSAIDs
should
be
assessed
at
the
80%
as
well
as
50%
inhibition
level
.

Iron
is
an
essential
micronutrient

polished
rice
contains

of

.

The
nutritional
composition
of
the
brown
and
milled
rice
grain
has
been
compared
with
that
of
the
non-transgenic
rice
of
the
same
variety
.

In
this
study
,
the
nutritional
components
,
as
well
as
the
anti-nutrient
levels
,
were
measured
.

Our
studies
established
that
apart
from
the
increased
level
of
iron
and
zinc
in
transgenic
seeds
,
the
nutritional
quality
of
both
the
brown
and
milled
rice
grains
from
the
transgenic
line
was
substantially
equivalent
to
that
of
the
non-transgenic
rice
plants
.

The
result
clearly
shows
that
the
measured
amounts
of
the
nutritional
components
are
well
within
the
range
of
values
reported
for
other
commercial
lines
.

RATIONALE
:
Denufosol
tetrasodium
is
a
selective
P2Y
(
2
)
agonist
that
enhances
mucosal
hydration
and
mucus
clearance
by
activating
Cl
(
-
)
secretion
and
inhibiting
epithelial
Na
(
+
)
transport
through
a
non-cystic
fibrosis
transmembrane
conductance
regulator
mechanism
in
the
lung
.

OBJECTIVES
:
To
examine
the
safety
and
efficacy
of
28
days
of
treatment
with
denufosol
compared
with
placebo
in
patients
with
mild

.

METHODS
:
The
study
was
a

double-blind
,
multi-center
,
28-day
,
phase
2
clinical
trial
of
denufosol
tetrasodium
inhalation
solution
(

)
versus

.

Patients
with

value
and
not
treated
with
inhaled
antibiotics
for
the
past
30
days
were
randomized
to
receive
one
of
three
doses
of
denufosol
or

administered
three
times

.

MEASUREMENTS
AND
MAIN
RESULTS
:
Eighty-nine
patients
were
randomized
and
received
the
study
drug
,
94%
completed
the
study
,
and
98%
were
compliant
with
dosing
.

All
treatments
were
generally
well
tolerated
,
with
no
dose-response
trends
observed
with
respect
to

.

The
most
common

)
.

Five

CONCLUSIONS
:
Denufosol
administered
three
times
daily
for
28
days
appeared
to
be
safe
and
well
tolerated
in
this
population
with

Arginase
catalyzes
the
hydrolysis
of
arginine
to
urea
and
ornithine
.

Urea
is
not
only
an
important
solute
for
concentrating
urine
but
also
inhibits
Na-K-2Cl
cotransport
.

To
elucidate
the
roles
of
arginase
in
the
development
of
salt-sensitive
hypertension
,
we
examined
arginase
activity
and
expression
in
the
kidney
and
other
organs
of
Dahl
/
Rapp
salt-sensitive
(
SS
)
and
salt-resistant
(
SR
)
rats
before
and
after
4
weeks'
administration
of
a
4%
NaCl
or
control
diet
.

At
4
weeks
of
age
,
arginase
activity
in
the
kidney
was
lower
in
SS
rats
than
in
SR
rats
.

Kidney
arginase
activity
was
lower
in
SS
rats
than
in
SR
rats
at
8
weeks
of
age
,
and
salt
loading
did
not
alter
arginase
activity
.

Arginase
II
(
the
dominant
isoform
in
the
kidney
)
mRNA
and
protein
in
the
kidney
of
salt-loaded
SS
rats
were
also
lower
than
those
of
salt-loaded
SR
rats
.

Arginase
activities
in
the
liver
and
cerebellum
did
not
differ
between
SS
and
SR
rats
.

To
examine
the
effect
of
urea
,
the
product
of
arginase
reaction
,
on
the
development
of
hypertension
,
SS
rats
were
given
a
4%
NaCl
diet
containing
5%
kaolin
or
5%
urea
.

Six-week
urea
supplementation
attenuated
the
development
of
hypertension
in
SS
rats
.

These
findings
suggest
that
decreased
arginase
expression
in
the
kidney
may
be
at
least
partially
responsible
for
the
salt-sensitive
hypertension
in
SS
rats
.
The
oncogenic
kinase
PAK4
was
recently
found
to
be
involved
in
the
regulation
of
the
G1
phase
and
the
G2
/
M
transition
of
the
cell
cycle
.

We
have
also
identified
that
PAK4
regulates
Ran
GTPase
activity
during
mitosis
.

Here
,
we
show
that
after
entering
mitosis
,
PAK4-depleted
cells
maintain
a
prolonged
metaphase-like
state
.

In
these
cells
,
chromosome
congression
to
the
metaphase
plate
occurs
with
normal
kinetics
but
is
followed
by
an
extended
period
during
which
membrane
blebbing
and
spindle
rotation
are
observed
.

These
bipolar
PAK4-depleted
metaphase-like
spindles
have
a
defective
astral
microtubule
(
MT
)
network
and
are
not
centered
in
the
cell
but
are
in
close
contact
with
the
cell
cortex
.

As
the
metaphase-like
state
persists
,
centrosome
fragmentation
occurs
,
chromosomes
scatter
from
the
metaphase
plate
and
move
toward
the
spindle
poles
with
an
active
spindle
assembly
checkpoint
,
a
phenotype
that
is
reminiscent
of
cohesion
fatigue
.

PAK4
also
regulates
the
acto-myosin
cytoskeleton
and
we
report
that
PAK4
depletion
results
in
the
induction
of
cortical
membrane
blebbing
during
prometaphase
arrest
.

However
,
we
show
that
membrane
blebs
,
which
are
strongly
enriched
in
phospho-cofilin
,
are
not
responsible
for
the
poor
anchoring
of
the
spindle
.

As
PAK4
depletion
interferes
with
the
localization
of
components
of
the
dynein
/
dynactin
complexes
at
the
kinetochores
and
on
the
astral
MTs
,
we
propose
that
loss
of
PAK4
could
induce
a
change
in
the
activities
of
motor
proteins
.
The
medial
prefrontal
cortex
(
mPFC
)
has
been
implicated
in
modulating
anxiety
.

However
,
it
is
unknown
whether
excitatory
or
inhibitory
neurotransmission
in
the
infralimbic
(
IL
)
subregion
of
the
mPFC
underlies
the
pathology
of
anxiety-related
behavior
.

To
address
this
issue
,
we
infused
the
GABAA
receptor
(
GABAAR
)
antagonist
bicuculline
to
temporarily
activate
the
IL
cortex
.

IL
cortex
activation
decreased
the
time
spent
in
the
center
area
in
the
open
field
test
,
decreased
exploration
of
the
open-arms
in
the
elevated
plus
maze
test
,
and
increased
the
latency
to
bite
food
in
the
novelty-suppressed
feeding
test
.

These
findings
substantiate
the
GABAergic
system's
role
in
anxiety-related
behaviors
.

IL
cortex
inactivation
with
the
AMPA
receptor
(
AMPAR
)
antagonist
CNQX
produced
opposite
,
anxiolytic
effects
.

However
,
infusion
of
the
NMDA
receptor
(
NMDAR
)
antagonist
AP5
into
the
IL
cortex
had
no
significant
effect
.

Additionally
,
we
did
not
observe
motor
activity
deficits
or
appetite
deficits
following
inhibition
of
GABAergic
or
glutamatergic
neurotransmission
.

Interestingly
,
we
found
parallel
and
corresponding
electrophysiological
changes
in
anxious
mice;
compared
to
mice
with
relatively
low
anxiety
,
the
relatively
high
anxiety
mice
exhibited
smaller
evoked
inhibitory
postsynaptic
currents
(
eIPSCs
)
and
larger
AMPA-mediated
evoked
excitatory
postsynaptic
currents
(
eEPSCs
)
in
pyramidal
neurons
in
the
IL
cortex
.

The
changes
of
eIPSCs
and
eEPSCs
were
due
to
presynaptic
mechanisms
.

Our
results
suggest
that
imbalances
of
neurotransmission
in
the
IL
cortex
may
cause
a
net
increase
in
excitatory
inputs
onto
pyramidal
neurons
,
which
may
underlie
the
pathogenic
mechanism
of
anxiety
disorders
.

The

against

,
with
preference
for

over

OBJECTIVE
:
To
investigate
the
distribution
of
the
A2756G
polymorphism
of
the
methionine
synthase
reductase
(
MTR
)
gene
in
patients
with
rheumatoid
arthritis
(
RA
)
treated
with
methotrexate
(
MTX
)
compared
with
a
healthy
control
group;
and
to
examine
the
relationships
among
the
A2756G
polymorphism
,
plasma
total
homocysteine
(
tHcy
)
,
serum
folate
and
vitamin
B12
levels
,
disease
activity
,
and
MTX
toxicity
in
patients
with
RA
.

METHODS
:
A
cross-sectional
study
was
performed
on
86
MTX-treated
RA
patients
,
consisting
of
a
clinical
interview
and
physical
examination
to
determine
disease
activity
and
MTX-related
adverse
reactions
.

Genotype
analysis
of
the
MTR
gene
was
performed
.

Fasting
plasma
tHcy
,
serum
folate
,
and
vitamin
B12
levels
were
measured
.

Allele
and
genotype
distributions
were
compared
to
a
healthy
control
group
.

RESULTS
:
The
frequency
of
the
2756GG
genotype
(
16
.
3%
)
in
the
RA
study
group
was
higher
than
that
expected
in
the
general
population
(
3
.
6%;
p
<
0
.
000001
)
.

This
genotype
was
associated
with
MTX-induced
accelerated
rheumatoid
nodulosis
(
MIARN
)
.

No
association
of
disease
activity
variables
or
plasma
homocysteine
with
MTR
A2756G
polymorphisms
was
observed
.

The
MTR
2756GG
genotype
,
low
plasma
vitamin
B12
levels
,
and
the
presence
of
rheumatoid
nodules
predicted
MIARN
.

No
association
of
nodulosis
with
any
other
indicator
of
disease
activity
or
medical
treatment
was
found
.

CONCLUSION
:
In
our
population
of
MTX-treated
RA
patients
the
2756GG
genotype
of
the
MTR
gene
was
more
common
than
expected
and
was
associated
with
MIARN
.

Metformin
,
a
drug
widely
used
in
the
treatment
of
type
2
diabetes
,
has
recently
been
shown
to
act
on
skeletal
muscle
and
liver
in
part
through
the
activation
of
AMP-activated
protein
kinase
(
AMPK
)
.

Whether
metformin
or
the
satiety
factor
leptin
,
which
also
stimulates
AMPK
in
muscle
,
regulates
this
enzyme
in
pancreatic
islets
is
unknown
.

We
have
recently
shown
that
forced
increases
in
AMPK
activity
inhibit
insulin
secretion
from
MIN6
cells
(

.

Here
,
we
explore
whether
1
)
glucose
,
metformin
,
or
leptin
regulates
AMPK
activity
in
isolated
islets
from
rodent
and
human
and
2
)
whether
changes
in
AMPK
activity
modulate
insulin
secretion
from
human
islets
.

Increases
in
glucose
concentration
from
0
to
3
and
from
3
to
17
mM
inhibited
AMPK
activity
in
primary
islets
from
mouse
,
rat
,
and
human
,
confirming
previous
findings
in
insulinoma
cells
.

Incubation
with
metformin
(
0
.
2-1
mM
)
activated
AMPK
in
both
human
islets
and
MIN6
beta-cells
in
parallel
with
an
inhibition
of
insulin
secretion
,
whereas
leptin
(
10-100
nM
)
was
without
effect
in
MIN6
cells
.

These
studies
demonstrate
that
AMPK
activity
is
subject
to
regulation
by
both
glucose
and
metformin
in
pancreatic
islets
and
clonal
beta-cells
.

The
inhibitory
effects
of
metformin
on
insulin
secretion
may
therefore
need
to
be
considered
with
respect
to
the
use
of
this
drug
for
the
treatment
of
type
2
diabetes
.
Exposure
to
artificial
food
colors
and
additives
(
AFCAs
)
has
been
implicated
in
the
induction
and
severity
of
some
childhood
behavioral
and
learning
disabilities
.

N-methyl-D-aspartate
receptors
(
NMDARs
)
and
nicotinic
acetylcholine
receptors
(
nACHRs
)
are
thought
to
be
effective
in
the
learning
and
memory-generating
process
.

In
this
study
,
we
investigated
the
effects
of
intrauterine
exposure
to
AFCAs
on
subunit
concentrations
of
NMDARs
and
nAChRs
isoforms
in
rats
.

We
administered
a
mixture
of
AFCAs
(
Eritrosin
,
Ponceau
4R
,
Allura
Red
AC
,
Sunset
Yellow
FCF
,
Tartrazin
,
Amaranth
,
Brilliant
Blue
,
Azorubin
and
Indigotin
)
to
female
rats
before
and
during
gestation
.

The
concentration
of
NR2A
and
NR2B
subunits
and
nAChR
α7
,
α4β2
isoforms
in
their
offspring's
hippocampi
were
measured
by
Western
Blotting
.

Expressions
of
NR2B
and
nAChR
β2
were
significantly
increased
(
17%
and
6
.
70%
,
respectively
)
,
whereas
expression
of
nAChR
α4
was
significantly
decreased
(
5
.
67%
)
in
male
experimental
group
compared
to
the
male
control
group
(
p<0
.
05
)
.

In
the
female
experimental
group
,
AFCAs
caused
a
14%
decrease
in
NR2B
expression
when
compared
to
the
female
control
group
(
p<0
.
05
)
.

Our
results
indicate
that
exposure
to
AFCAs
during
the
fetal
period
may
lead
to
alterations
in
expressions
of
NMDARs
and
nAChRs
in
adulthood
.

These
alterations
were
different
between
male
and
female
genders
.
Our
knowledge
of
how
androgens
influence
the
cardiovascular
system
is
far
from
complete
,
and
this
lack
of
understanding
is
especially
true
of
how
androgens
affect
resistance
vessels
.

Our
aim
was
to
identify
the
signaling
mechanisms
stimulated
by
testosterone
(
TES
)
in
microvascular
arteries
and
to
understand
how
these
mechanisms
mediate
TES-induced
vasodilation
.

Mesenteric
microvessels
were
isolated
from
male
Sprague-Dawley
rats
.

Tension
studies
demonstrated
a
rapid
,
concentration-dependent
,
vasodilatory
response
to
TES
that
did
not
involve
protein
synthesis
or
aromatization
to
17β-estradiol
.

Dichlorofluorescein
fluorescence
and
nitrotyrosine
immunoblot
experiments
indicated
that
TES
stimulated
peroxynitrite
formation
in
microvessels
,
and
functional
studies
demonstrated
that
TES-induced
vasodilation
was
inhibited
by
scavenging
peroxynitrite
.

As
predicted
,
TES
enhanced
the
production
of
both
peroxynitrite
precursors
(
i
.

e
.

,
superoxide
and
nitic
oxide
)
,
and
xanthine
oxidase
was
identified
as
the
likely
source
of
TES-stimulated
superoxide
production
.

Functional
and
biochemical
studies
indicated
that
TES
signaling
involved
activity
of
the
phosphoinositide
3
(
PI3
)
kinase-protein
kinase
B
(
Akt
)
cascade
initiated
by
activation
of
the
androgen
receptor
and
culminated
in
enhanced
production
of
cGMP
and
microvascular
vasodilation
.

These
findings
,
derived
from
a
variety
of
analytical
and
functional
approaches
,
provide
evidence
for
a
novel
nongenomic
signaling
mechanism
for
androgen
action
in
the
microvasculature
:
TES-stimulated
vasodilation
mediated
primarily
by
peroxynitrite
formed
from
xanthine
oxidase-generated
superoxide
and
NO
.

This
response
was
associated
with
activation
of
the
PI3
kinase-Akt
signaling
cascade
initiated
by
activation
of
the
androgen
receptor
.

We
propose
this
mechanism
could
account
for
TES-stimulated
cGMP
production
in
microvessels
and
,
ultimately
,
vasodilation
.
Leptin
presents
an
important
role
in
energy
balance
and
neuroendocrine
control
in
mammals
.

In
an
attempt
to
identify
regions
of
the
leptin
molecule
responsible
for
its
bioactivity
,
we
have
synthesized
six
peptides
based
on
the
protein
three-dimensional
structure
.

Fragments
were
synthesized
by
the
solid-phase
methodology
,
purified
by
reverse-phase
high-performance
liquid
chromatography
(
RP-HPLC
)
,
and
characterized
by
liquid
chromatography-electrospray
ionization
mass
spectrometry
(
LC
/
ESI-MS
)
.

They
were
injected
intravenously
and
their
ability
to
induce
Fos
immunoreactivity
(
Fos-ir
)
in
rat
hypothalamus
was
compared
with
that
of
the
recombinant
human
leptin
and
saline
.

Fragment
Ac-
[
Ser117
]
Lep116-140-NH2
(
V
)
induced
Fos-ir
in
hypothalamic
nuclei
that
express
leptin
receptor
long
form
.

No
similar
ability
was
observed
for
the
other
five
fragments
.

To
investigate
whether
Fos-ir
was
induced
in
the
same
neuronal
group
activated
by
leptin
,
we
proceeded
with
a
dual-label
immunohistochemistry
for
cocaine-
and
amphetamine-regulated
transcript
(
CART
)
,
a
neuropeptide
related
to
leptin
action
in
rat
hypothalamus
.

We
found
that
Ac-
[
Ser117
]
Lep116-140-NH2
(
V
)
differentially
activates
CART
neurons
through
the
rostrocaudal
extension
of
the
arcuate
nucleus
.

These
results
suggest
that
this
fragment
acts
in
the
same
group
of
neurons
that
mediate
leptin
response
.

This
approach
may
offer
the
basis
for
the
development
of
leptin-related
compounds
,
having
potential
application
in
human
or
veterinary
medicine
.
Steroid
receptors
were
classically
described
for
regulating
transcription
by
binding
to
target
gene
promoters
.

However
,
genome-wide
studies
reveal
that
steroid
receptors-binding
sites
are
mainly
located
at
intragenic
regions
.

To
determine
the
role
of
these
sites
,
we
examined
the
effect
of
progestins
on
the
transcription
of
the
bcl-x
gene
,
where
only
intragenic
progesterone
receptor-binding
sites
(
PRbs
)
were
identified
.

We
found
that
in
response
to
hormone
treatment
,
the
PR
is
recruited
to
these
sites
along
with
two
histone
acetyltransferases
CREB-binding
protein
(
CBP
)
and
GCN5
,
leading
to
an
increase
in
histone
H3
and
H4
acetylation
and
to
the
binding
of
the
SWI
/
SNF
complex
.

Concomitant
,
a
more
relaxed
chromatin
was
detected
along
bcl-x
gene
mainly
in
the
regions
surrounding
the
intragenic
PRbs
.

PR
also
mediated
the
recruitment
of
the
positive
elongation
factor
pTEFb
,
favoring
RNA
polymerase
II
(
Pol
II
)
elongation
activity
.

Together
these
events
promoted
the
re-distribution
of
the
active
Pol
II
toward
the
3'-end
of
the
gene
and
a
decrease
in
the
ratio
between
proximal
and
distal
transcription
.

These
results
suggest
a
novel
mechanism
by
which
PR
regulates
gene
expression
by
facilitating
the
proper
passage
of
the
polymerase
along
hormone-dependent
genes
.
The
rates

acetylcholinesterase
(
AChE;

)
by
paraoxon
,
haloxon
,
DDVP
and
enantiomers
of
neutral
alkyl
methylphosphonyl
thioates
and
cationic
alkyl
methylphosphonyl
thiocholines
were
measured
in
the
presence
and
absence
of
AChE
peripheral
site
inhibitors
:
gallamine
,
d-tubocurarine
,
propidium
,
atropine
and
derivatives
of
coumarin
.

All
ligands
,
except
the
coumarins
,
at
submillimolar
concentrations
enhanced
the
rates
of
inhibition
by
neutral
organophosphates
,
whereas
inhibition
rates
by
cationic
organophosphates
were
decreased
.

When
peripheral
site
ligand
concentrations
extended
to
millimolar
concentrations
the
extent
of
the
enhancement
decreased
,
creating
a
well-shaped
activation
profile
.

Analysis
of
inhibition
by
DDVP
revealed
that
peripheral
site
inhibitors
increase
the
second-order
reaction
rates
by
increasing
maximal
rates
of
phosphorylation
.

These
observations
suggest
that
peripheral
site
ligands
are
capable
of
allosterically
affecting
the
conformation
of
residues
in
the
choline
binding
site
of
AChE
,
thus
optimizing
the
position
of
the
leaving
group
of
uncharged
organophosphates
during
the
inhibition
reaction

pivotal
physiological
roles
.

Therefore
,
it
is
important
to
determine
the
dominant
P450
AA
monooxygenases
in
different
organs
.

We
investigated
the
P450
AA
monooxygenases
protein
expression
as
well
as
regioselectivity
,
immunoinhibition
,
and
kinetic
profile
of
AA
epoxygenation
and

in

,
lung
,
kidney
,
and
liver
.

Thereafter
,
the
predominant
P450
epoxygenases
and
P450
hydroxylases
in
these
organs
were
characterized
.

Microsomes
from
heart
,
lung
,
kidney
,
and
liver
were
incubated
with
AA
.

The
protein
expression
of
CYP2B1
/
2
,
CYP2C11
,
CYP2C23
,
CYP2J3
,
CYP4A1
/
2
/
3
,
and
CYP4Fs
in
the
heart
,
lung
,
kidney
,
and
liver
were
determined
by
Western
blot
analysis
.

The
levels
of
AA
metabolites
were
determined
by
liquid
chromatography-electrospray
ionization
mass
spectroscopy
.

This
was
followed
by
determination
of
regioselectivity
,
immunoinhibition
effect
,
and
the
kinetic
profile
of
AA
metabolism
.

AA
was
metabolized
to
epoxyeicosatrienoic
acids
and
19-
and
20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic
acid
in
the
heart
,
lung
,
kidney
,
and
liver
but
with
varying
metabolic
activities
and
regioselectivity
.

Anti-P450
antibodies
were
found
to
differentially
inhibit
AA
epoxygenation
and
hydroxylation
in
these
organs
.

Our
data
suggest
that
the
predominant
epoxygenases
are
CYP2C11
,
CYP2B1
,
CYP2C23
,
and
CYP2C11
/
CYP2C23
for
the
heart
,
lung
,
kidney
,
and
liver
,
respectively
.

On
the
other
hand
,
CYP4A1
is
the
major
ω-hydroxylase
in
the
heart
and
kidney;
whereas
CYP4A2
and
/
or
CYP4F1
/
4
are
probably
the
major
hydroxlases
in
the
lung
and
liver
.

These
results
provide
important
insights
into
the
activities
of
P450
epoxygenases
and
P450
hydroxylases-mediated
AA
metabolism
in
different
organs

9-Methoxycamptothecin
(
MCPT
)
has
been
recently
reported
to
have
a
strong
anticancer
activity
.

However
,
its
detailed
mechanism
of
action
in
human
cancer
cells
has
not
been
well
clarified
.

The
results
showed
that
MCPT
induced
cytotoxicity
in
seven
human
cancer
cell
lines
in
a
dose
dependent
manner
after
72h
,
with
A2780
and
Hela
cell
lines
more
sensitive
,
so
the
two
cell
lines
were
chosen
to
do
further
studies
.

MCPT
induced
strong
G2
/
M
arrest
in
both
A2780
cells
and
Hela
cells
after
24h
,
following
by
substantial
sub-G1
arrest
(
indicating
apoptosis
)
.

The
apoptosis
was
verified
by
staining
with
Annexin
V-FITC
and
propidium
iodide
.

ROS
generation
increased
significantly
in
MCPT-induced
apoptosis
.

Meanwhile
,
the
apoptosis
appeared
to
be
dependent
on
caspase-3
,
-8
and
-9
in
A2780
cells
,
and
caspase-3
in
Hela
cells
.

In
addition
,
MCPT
induced
up-regulation
expression
of
most
of
seventeen
genes
in
both
cell
lines
.

Western
blot
verified
that
changes
of
TNFα
,
Fas
,
P53
and
P27
protein
level
were
consistent
with
their
gene
expression
changes
.

Taken
together
,
MCPT
plays
an
important
role
in
tumor
growth
suppression
by
inducing
apoptosis
in
both
cell
lines
via
extrinsic
and
intrinsic
apoptotic
pathways
,
and
has
the
potential
to
be
developed
into
an
antitumor
agent

Apomorphine
,
the
catechol-derived
dopamine
D1
/
D2
receptor
agonist
,
is
currently
in
use
as
an
antiparkinsonian
drug
.

It
has
previously
been
reported
that
apomorphine
was
able
to
elicit
expression
of
the
enzyme
tyrosine
hydroxylase
,
a
marker
for
DA
neurons
,
in
the
fetal
rat
cerebrocortical
cultures
whilst
in
the
presence
of
brain-derived
neurotrophic
factor
.

The
present
study
demonstrated
that
treatment
of
fetal
rat
ventral
mesencephalic
cultures
with
apomorphine
caused
a
marked
increase
in
the
number
of
dopaminergic
neurons
.

The
action
of
apomorphine
can
be
mimicked
by
dopamine
receptor
(
D1
and
D2
)
agonists
or
blocked
by
preincubation
with
D1
/
D2
receptor
antagonists
.

Incubation
of
recipient
mesencephalic
cultures
with
the
conditioned
medium
derived
from
apomorphine-stimulated
donor
mesencephalic
cultures
elicited
a
3
.
72-fold
increase
in
the
number
of
TH-positive
neurons
.

Increased
mRNA
expression
levels
of
brain-derived
neurotrophic
factor
and
glial
cell
line-derived
neurotrophic
factor
were
also
found
in
the
apomorphine-treated
mesencephalic
cells
along
with
concomitant
protein
expression
increases
in
the
conditioned
medium
.

Moreover
,
the
trophic
activity
observed
could
be
partially
neutralized
by
antibodies
against
either
brain-derived
neurotrophic
factor
or
glial
cell
line-derived
neurotrophic
factor
.

Cultured
fetal
striatal
cells
,
but
not
hippocampal
cells
,
also
responded
to
apomorphine
treatment
.

The
membrane
filtration
studies
revealed
that
both
<30
kDa
and
>50
kDa
fractions
contained
trophic
activities
.

The
latter
characterization
distinguishes
them
from
most
known
neurotrophic
factors
.

These
results
suggest
that
the
apomorphine-modulated
development
of
dopaminergic
neurons
may
be
mediated
by
activation
of
the
dopamine
receptor
subtypes
D1
and
D2
thereby
increasing
the
production
of
multiple
growth
factors
.

Overexpression
of
the
epidermal
growth
factor
receptor
(
EGFR
)
has
been
observed
in
a
wide
variety
of
human
cancers
and
is
associated
with
a
poor
clinical
prognosis
.

In
many
cases
,
growth
of
the
tumor
cells
is
dependent
on
EGFR-mediated
signals
,
because
inhibition
of
binding
of
factors
to
the
EGFR
leads
to
cell
death
.

Using
XenoMouse
technology
,
a
fully
human
EGFR-specific
monoclonal
antibody
,
ABX-EGF
,
with
high
affinity
(
5
x
10
(

)
has
been
generated
.

ABX-EGF
blocks
binding
of
both
epidermal
growth
factor
and
transforming
growth
factor
alpha
to
the
EGFR
,
inhibits
tyrosine
phosphorylation
of
the
EGFR
,
and
inhibits
cellular
proliferation
.

In

,
ABX-EGF
not
only
blocks
formation
of
human
epidermoid
carcinoma
A431
xenografts
in
athymic
mice
,
but
also
mediates
therapeutic
elimination
of
established
tumors
and
acts
cooperatively
with
chemotherapeutics
in
mediating
tumor
regression
.

These
observations
provide
a
strong
basis
for
the
development
of
ABX-EGF
as
a
therapeutic
agent
for
human
solid
tumors
that
overexpress

Out
of
91
PDTC
patients
,
27
(
30%
)
had
gross
ETE
(
T4a
)
and
they
formed
the
basis
of
our
study
.

Of
27
patients
,
52%
were
female
.

The
median
age
was
70
(
range
27-87
)
.

Ten
patients
(
37%
)
presented
with
distant
metastases;
four
to
the
bone
,
three
to

and
three
had
both
bone
and

metastases
.

All
patients
had

,
3
(

by

.

Median
follow-up
time
was
57
months
(
range
1-197
months
)
.

The
5
year
OS
and
DSS
were
47%
and
49%
respectively
.

This
poor
outcome
was
due
to
distant
metastatic
disease;
10
patients
had
distant
metastases
at
presentation
and
a
further
6
developed
distant
metastases
during
follow
up
.

Locoregional
control
was
good
with
5
year
LRFS
and
RRFS
of
70%
and
62%
respectively
.

Overall
,
8
patients
(
30%
)
had

:
2
had
distant

,
2
regional
,
2
regional
and
distant
,
1
local

,
and
1
had
local
,
regional
and
distant
recurrence
.

Aggressive
surgery
in
patients
with
PDTC
showing
gross
ETE
resulted
in
satisfactory
locoregional
control
.

Due
to
the
small
proportion
of
patients
who
received
PORT
(
22%
)
,
it
is
not
possible
to
analyze
its
benefit
on
locoregional
control
.

Of
significance
is
the
observation
that
the
majority
of
patients
(
60%
)
who
presented
with
or
subsequently
developed
distant
metastases
eventually
died
of
distant
disease

The
immunosuppressant
sirolimus
and
curcumin
,
the
main
principle
of
the
turmeric
spice
,
have
shown
antiproliferative
effects
on
many
human
and
not-human
cell
lines
.

Whereas
the
antiproliferative
effect
of
sirolimus
is
mainly
mediated
by
inhibition
of
mTOR
,
curcumin
is
described
to
affect
many
molecular
targets
which
makes
it
unpredictable
to
appraise
if
the
effects
of
these
both
substances
on
cell
proliferation
and
especially
on
immunosuppression
are
additive
or
synergistic
.

To
answer
this
question
we
investigated
the
interaction
of
both
these
substances
on
OKT3-induced
human
peripheral
blood
mononuclear
cell
(
PBMC
)
proliferation
.

OKT3-induced
human
PBMC
proliferation
was
determined
by
measuring

H-thymidine
incorporation
.

Influence
of
curcumin
on

)
release
and
IκB-phosphorylation
in

was
determined
by
ELISA
and
western

,
respectively
.

Curcumin-induced
apoptosis
and
necrosis
was
analyzed
by
FACS
analysis
.

Whereas
curcumin
completely
inhibited
OKT3-induced
PBMC
proliferation
in
a
dose-dependent
manner
with
an
IC
(
50
)
of
2
.
8
μM
,
sirolimus
could
reduce
PBMC
proliferation
dose-dependently
only
to
a
minimum
of
28%
at
a
concentration
of
5
ng
/

(

.

When

was

with
sirolimus
at
concentrations
from

the
effects
were

.

curcumin
(

.
25-2

5
μM
)
with
sirolimus
(

)
showed
additive
effects
.

The
effects
after
combination
of
curcumin
at
5
μM
with
each
sirolimus
concentration
and
sirolimus
at
10
ng
/
ml
with
each
curcumin
concentration
were
presumably
antagonistic
.

We
conclude
that
the
immunosuppressive
effects
of
curcumin
and
sirolimus
in
low
concentrations
are
synergistic
in
OKT3-activated
PBMC
.

Whether
curcumin
and
sirolimus
have
also
synergistic
antiproliferative
effects
in
tumor
cells
has
to
be
shown
in
further
experiments

RESULTS
:

-shogaol
in
astrocytes
following
exposure
to
hydrogen

compared
with

only
treated

Moreover
,
[

counteracted
the
reduced

O
(

and
protected
these

from

by
attenuating
the

.

This

suggest
that
following

,
[

-shogaol
protects
astrocytes
from
oxidative
damage
through
the
up-regulating
levels

provide
further
support
for
the
use

The
electronic

amino
acids
in
aqueous

far-ultraviolet
(
ATR-FUV
)
spectroscopy
in
the
region
from
145

.

From
the
measured
ATR
spectra
of
sample
solutions
,
the
FUV
absorption
spectra
attributed
to
the
amino
acids
were
separated
from
the
intense
solvent
absorption
by
using
a
modified
Kramers-Kronig
transformation
method
.

The
FUV
absorption
spectra
of
the
amino
acids
reflect
the
protonation
states
of
the
backbone
and
side-chain
structures
.

The
contributions

the
side
chains
to
the
spectra
were
also
examined
from
the
difference
spectra
subtracting
the
corresponding
Gly
spectrum
from
each
spectrum
.

The
observed
spectra
were
compared
mostly
with
the
electronic
transition
studies
of
the
molecular
fragments
of
the
amino
acids
in

phase
.

The
FUV
spectra
of
the
amino

exhibited
the
intra-
and
intermolecular
electronic
interactions
of
the
solute-solute
as
well
as
the

those
are

was
organized
into

with
the
rank

dorsomedial
(

with

properties
.

The
hippocampus
is
involved
in
learning
and
memory
and
seems
particularly
vulnerable
to
amphetamine's
neurotoxicity
.

We
evaluated
the
neurotoxicity
of
DOI
and
MDMA
in
primary
neuronal
cultures
of
hippocampus
obtained
from
Wistar
rat
embryos
(
E-17
to

)
.

Mature
neurons
after
10
days
in
culture
were
exposed
for
24
or
48
h
either
to
MDMA
(
100-800

.

Both
the

and
the

assays
revealed
a
concentration-
and
time-dependent
neuronal
death
and
mitochondrial
dysfunction
after
exposure
to
both
drugs
.

Both
drugs
promoted
a
significant
increase
in
caspase-8
and
caspase-3
activities
.

At
concentrations
that
produced
similar
levels
of
neuronal
death
,
DOI
promoted
a
higher
increase
in
the
activity
of
both
caspases
than
MDMA
.

In
the
mitochondrial
fraction
of
neurons
exposed
24h
to

,
we
found
a
significant
increase
in
the

kDa
band
of

Moreover
,
24h

promoted
an

fraction
of
neurons

In
conclusion
,
hallucinogenic
amphetamines
promoted
programmed
neuronal

.

Phosphatidylserine
(
PtdSer
)
,
major
acidic
phospholipids

,
participate
in
important
cell

processes
.

The
PtdSer
in
brain
is
highly
enriched
with
docosahexaenoic
acid
(
DHA;
22
:
6n-3
)
,
and
the
DHA
status
or
ethanol
exposure
has
been
shown
to
influence
the
PtdSer
level
.

This
study
shows
that
ethanol
exposure
during
prenatal
and
developmental
period
significantly
attenuates
microsomal
PtdSer
biosynthetic
activities
and
reduces
PtdSer
,
particularly
18
:
0
,
22
:
6-PtdSer
,
in
developing
rat
brain
cortices
.

Brain
microsomes
were
incubated
with
deuterium
labeled
exogenous
substrates
in

and
the
products
formed
were
detected
by
reversed
phase
HPLC-electrospray
ionization
mass
spectrometry
(
ESI-MS
)
.

These
in

bioassays
showed
that
1-stearoyl-2-docosahexaenoyl
(
18
:
0
,
22
:
6
)
species
is
the
best
substrate
for
PtdSer
synthesis
from
both
phosphatidylcholine
(
PtdCho
)
and
phosphatidylethanolamine
(
PtdEtn
)
.

The
PtdSer
biosynthetic
activity
of
brain
,
especially
for
18
:
0
,
22
:
6-PtdSer
production
,
was
hampered
significantly
by
maternal
exposure
to
ethanol
.

PtdSer
levels
were
consistently
reduced
significantly
in
brain
cortices
of
the
pups
from
ethanol-exposed
dams
,
due
mainly
to
the
depletion
of
18
:
0
,
22
:
6-PtdSer
.

The
mRNA
expression
of
PtdSer
synthase
1
(
PSS1
)
and
PtdSer
synthase
2
(
PSS2
)
was
not
reduced
by
ethanol
.

Similarly
,
the
PSS1
enzyme
level
did
not
change
after
ethanol
exposure
but
PSS2
could
not
be
probed
with
the
antibody
available
currently
.

Degradation
of
PtdSer
by
mitochondrial
PtdSer
decarboxylation
was
not
enhanced
but
also
inhibited
.

Taken
together
,
attenuated
PtdSer
biosynthetic
activities
are
largely
responsible
for
the
PtdSer
reduction
observed
in
developing
rat
brains
after

Fifteen
novel
derivatives
of
glycyrrhetinic
acid
(
GA
)
were
synthesized
and
evaluated
for
anti-inflammatory
activities
.

It
was
found
that
the
introduction
of
1-en-3-one
and
9
(
11
)
,
12-diene
and
2
,
20-dinitrile
functionalities
into
the
scaffold
of
GA
led
to
the
discovery
of
potent
compound
19
for
inhibition
of
LPS-induced
NO
production
.

Furthermore
,
19
effectively
inhibited
the
protein
and
mRNA
expression
of
inducible
NO
synthase
(
iNOS
)
and
the
mRNA
expression
of
TNF-α
,
IL-6
,
and
IL-1β
in
LPS-stimulated

macrophages
.

Mechanistically
,
19
exerted
inhibitory
effects
on
the
activation
of
the
three
main
MAPKs
and
phosphorylation
and
degradation
of
IκB-α
,
as
well
as
the
ratio
of
nuclear
/
cytosolic
content
of
p65
.

Importantly
,
19
significantly
decreased
the
mortality
rate
in
the
mouse
model
of
LPS-induced
sepsis
shock
.

It
is
noteworthy
that
inhibitory
effect
of
19
on
NO
production
was
not
blocked
by
the
glucocorticoid
receptor
antagonist
mifepristone
,
indicating
that
it
does
not
act
through
the
glucocorticoid
receptor
.
14C-N-Ethylmaleimide-S-cysteinylglycine
was
used
to
investigate
the
role
of
dehydropeptidase-I
in
the
metabolism
of
glutathione
conjugates
.

The
dipeptide
was
rapidly
hydrolyzed
to
14C-N-ethylmaleimide-S-cysteine
in
isolated
rat
renal
cells
,
and
subsequently
acetylated
to
14C-N-ethylmaleimide-S-N-acetylcysteine
.

Cilastatin
,
a
specific
inhibitor
of
dehydropeptidase-I
,
strongly
inhibited
the
hydrolysis
of
the
dipeptide
by
the
isolated
cells
.

In
rat
kidney
homogenates
,
the
marked
inhibitory
effect
of
cilastatin
was
also
observed
on
the
hydrolysis
of
cystinyl-bis-glycine
and
leukotriene
D4
,
which
are
dipeptide
intermediates
in
the
biotransformation
of
oxidized
glutathione
and
endogenous
glutathione
conjugate
,
respectively
.

In
contrast
,
the
inhibitory
effect
of
bestatin
,
a
potent
inhibitor
of
aminopeptidase-M
,
was
much
smaller
than
that
of
cilastatin
on
the
hydrolysis
of
these
dipeptides
by
the
renal
cells
and
homogenates
.

These
results
suggest
that
dehydropeptidase-I
plays
a
more
important
role
in
the
metabolism
of
glutathione
and
its
conjugates
than
aminopeptidase-M
does
.

Whereas
the
structure
of
the
OP

the

and
examined
the

The

glut3-luciferase
reporter

in
HT22
hippocampal
neurons
demonstrated
that
(
m
)
CpGs
inhibit

transcription
.

Contrary
to
this
biological
function
,
glut3
expression
rises
synchronously
with
(
m
)
CpGs
in
PN14

.

Chromatin
immunoprecipitation
(
IP
)
revealed
that
methyl-CpG
binding
protein
2
(
Mecp2
)
bound
the
glut3-
(
m
)
CpGs
.

Depending
on
association
with
specific
coregulators
,
Mecp2
,
a
dual
regulator
of
gene
transcription
,
may
repress
or
activate
a
downstream
gene
.

Sequential
chromatin
IP
uncovered
the
glut3-
(

)
CpGs
to
bind
Mecp2
exponentially
upon
recruitment
of
Creb1
rather
than
histone
deacetylase

.

Co-IP
and
coimmunolocalization
confirmed
that
Creb1
associated
with
Mecp2
and
cotransfection
with
glut3-
(
m
)
CpG
in
HT22
cells
enhanced
glut3

We
conclude
that
Glut3
is
a

that
recruits

.

Recruitment
of

investigated
and
showed
cytotoxic
effects
against

OBJECTIVE
:
The
objective
of
this
study
was
to
determine
the
effect
of
nonspecific
phosphodiesterase
inhibition
on
transcription
factor
activation
and
tumor
necrosis
factor-alpha
(
TNF-alpha
)
production
in
lipopolysaccharide
(
LPS
)
-stimulated
human
mononuclear
cells
.

INTRODUCTION
:
The
production
of
TNF-alpha
following
LPS
stimulation
is
one
of
the
key
steps
in
bacterial
sepsis
and
inflammation
.

The
mechanism
by
which
phosphodiesterase
inhibition
alters
TNF-alpha
production
in
the
presence
of
LPS
remains
unclear
.

METHODS
:
Human
mononuclear
cells
were
stimulated
with
LPS
(
1
microg
/
mL
)
,
in
the
presence
and
absence
of
Pentoxifylline
(
PTX;
20
mM
)
,
a
nonspecific
phosphodiesterase
inhibitor
.

Western
blotting
of
phosphorylated
cytoplasmic
I-kBalpha
,
nuclear
factor-kB
p65
(
NF-kB
)
,
and
nuclear
cAMP-response
element
binding
protein
(
CREB
)
was
performed
.

DNA
binding
of
NF-kB
and
CREB
was
verified
by
electrophoretic
mobility
shift
assay
.

TNF-a
levels
were
determined
in
the
supernatant
of
stimulated
cells
in
the
presence
and
absence
Protein
kinase
A
inhibition
by
an
enzyme-linked
immunosorbent
assay
(
ELISA
)
.

RESULTS
:
PTX
was
demonstrated
to
significantly
reduce
cytoplasmic
I-kBalpha
phosphorylation
,
nuclear
p65
phosphorylation
,
and
the
DNA
binding
activity
of
NF-kB
.

In
contrast
,
PTX
markedly
enhanced
the
phosphorylation
and
DNA
binding
activity
of
CREB
.

Cells
concomitantly
treated
with
PTX
and
LPS
secreted
similar
levels
of
TNF-a
in
the
presence
and
absence
Protein
kinase
A
inhibition
.

DISCUSSION
:
The
increased
level
of
cAMP
that
results
from
phosphodiesterase
inhibition
affects
cytoplasmic
and
nuclear
events
,
resulting
in
the
attenuation
of
NF-kB
and
the
activation
of
CREB
transcriptional
DNA
binding
through
pathways
that
are
partially
Protein
kinase
A-independent
.

CONCLUSION
:
PTX-mediated
phosphodiesterase
inhibition
occurs
partially
through
a
Protein
kinase
A-independent
pathway
and
may
serve
as
a
useful
tool
in
the
attenuation
of
LPS-induced
inflammation
.

In
preceding
studies
,
we
demonstrated
that
choline
carboxylates
ChC
(
m
)
with
alkyl
chain
lengths
of
m
=
12
-
18
are
highly
water-soluble
(
for
m
=
12
,
soluble
up
to
93
wt
%
soap
and
0
°C
)
.

In
addition
,
choline
soaps
are
featured
by
an
extraordinary
lyotropic
phase
behavior
.

With
decreasing
water
concentration
,
the
following
phases
were
found
:
micellar
phase
(
L
(
1
)
)
,
discontinuous
cubic
phase
(
I
(
1
)
'
and
I
(

)
"
)
,
hexagonal
phase
(
H
(
1
)
)
,
bicontinuous
cubic
phase
(
V
(
1
)
)
,
and
lamellar
phase
(
L
(
α
)
)
.

The
present
work
is
also
focused
on
the
lyotropic
phase
behavior
of
choline
soaps
but
with
shorter
alkyl
chains
or
different
alkyl
chain
properties
.

We
have
investigated
the
aqueous
phase
behavior
of
choline
soaps
with
C
(
8
)
and
C
(
10
)
chain-lengths
(
choline
octanoate
and
choline
decanoate
)
and
with
a
C
(
18
)
chain-length
with
a
cis-double
bond
(
choline
oleate
)
.

We
found
that
choline
decanoate
follows
the
lyotropic
phase
behavior
of
the
longer-chain
homologues
mentioned
above
.

Choline
octanoate
in
water
shows
no
discontinuous
cubic
phases
,
but
an
extended
,
isotropic
micellar
solution
phase
.

In
addition
,
choline
octanoate
is
at
the
limit
between
a
surfactant
and
a
hydrotrope
.

The
double
bond
in
choline
oleate
leads
also
to
a
better
solubility
in
water
and
a
decrease
of
the
solubilization
temperature
.

It
also
influences
the
Gaussian
curvature
of
the
aggregates
which
results
in
a
loss
of
discontinuous
cubic
phases
in
the
binary
phase
diagram
.

The
different
lyotropic
mesophases
were
identified
by
the
penetration
scan
technique
with
polarizing
light
microscope
and
visual
observations
.

To
clarify
the
structural
behavior
small
(
SAXS
)
and
wide
(
WAXS
)
angle
X-ray
scattering
were
performed
.

To
further
characterize
the
extended
,
isotropic
micellar
solution
phase
in
the
binary
phase
diagram
of
choline
octanoate
viscosity
and
conductivity
measurements
were
also
carried
out
.
The
temperature
and

dependence
of
the

calculated
with
the

method
employing
conventional

estimates
for
the

rate
coefficients
in
the
temperature
range
of

K
.

Geometries

were
obtained
at
the

.

A
modified
G3
(

,
CC
)
method
has
been
used
to
calculate
accurate
electronic
energies
for
all
of
the
species
involved
in
the
reactions
.

The
rigid-rotor
harmonic
oscillator
approximation
has
been
used
for
all
of
the
vibrations
except
for
the
torsional
degrees
of
freedom
which
are
being
treated
as
1D
hindered
rotor
.

Asymmetric
Eckart
barriers
were
used
to
model
tunneling
effect
in
a
one-dimensional
reaction
coordinate
through
saddle
points
.

Our
calculated
results
show
that
the
four
reaction
channels
forming
1-buten-2-ol
+
HÿO2
radical
(
R5
)
,
2-buten-2-ol
+

radical
(

)
,

+
ÿO
H
radical
(
R13
)
,
2-methyl-2-oxetanol
+
ÿOH
radical
(
R15
)
are
the
dominant
channels
.

When
the
temperature
is
below
1000
K
,
the
reaction
R15
forming
the
cyclic
ether
,
2-methyl-2-oxetanol
,
is
dominant;
while
the
reaction
R13
forming
acetic
acid
+
ethylene
+
ÿOH
radical
becomes
increasingly
dominant
at
temperatures
above
1000
K
.

The
other
two
channels
forming
1-buten-2-ol
,
2-buten-2-ol
and
HO2
radical
are
not
dominant
but
are
still
important
product
channels
over
the
whole
temperature
range
investigated
here
.

No
pressure
dependence
has
been
found
for
the
reaction
channels
forming
2-methyl-2-oxetanol
+
OH
radical
and
acetic
acid
+
ethylene
+
OH
radical
.

A
slightly
negative
pressure
dependence
has
been
found
for
the
reaction
channels
producing
the
two
butenols
.

Rate
constants
for
the
four
important
reaction
channels
at

(

are

provide
additional
evidences
so
that
this

can
be
reconsidered
in
the

as
well
as
in

,
the
essential

The

showed
cytotoxic

related
to

AIM
:
To
study
the
changes
in
the
expression
and
phosphorylation
of
cAMP
response
element
binding
protein
(
CREB
)
in
the
rat
nucleus
accumbens
after
chronic
ethanol
intake
and
its
withdrawal
.

METHODS
:
Ethanol
was
given
in
drinking
water
at
the
concentration
of
6
%
(
v
/
v
)
,
for
one
month
.

Changes
in
the
levels
of
CREB
and
phospho-CREB
(
p-CREB
)
protein
in
the
nucleus
accumbens
were
measured
by
immunohistochemistry
methods
.

RESULTS
:
Ethanol
given
to
rats
in
drinking
water
decreased
the
level
of
p-CREB
protein
in
the
nucleus
accumbens
(
-75
%
)
at
the
time
of
exposure
to
ethanol
.

The
decrement
of
p-CREB
protein
in
the
nucleus
accumbens
remained
at
24
h
(
-35
%
)
and
72
h
(
-28
%
)
of
ethanol
withdrawal
,
which
recovered
toward
control
level
after
7
d
of
ethanol
withdrawal
.

However
,
chronic
ethanol
,
as
well
as
ethanol
withdrawal
failed
to
produce
any
significant
alteration
in
the
level
of
CREB
protein
in
the
nucleus
accumbens
.

Naloxone
(
alone
)
treatment
of
rats
had
no
effect
on
the
levels
of
CREB
and
p-CREB
protein
in
the
nucleus
accumbens
.

However
,
when
naloxone
was
administered
concurrently
with
ethanol
treatment
,
it
antagonized
the
down-regulation
of
p-CREB
protein
in
the
nucleus
accumbens
(
142
%
)
of
rats
exposed
to
ethanol
.

CONCLUSION
:
A
long-term
intake
of
ethanol
solution
down-regulates
the
phosphorylation
of
CREB
in
the
nucleus
accumbens
,
and
those
changes
can
be
reversed
by
naloxone
,
which
may
be
one
kind
of
the
molecular
mechanisms
associated
with
ethanol
dependence
.

The
mammalian
target
of
rapamycin
(
mTOR
)
and
its
molecular
pathways
are
supposed
to
be
activated
frequently
in
human
renal

as
well
as
other
cancers
.

It
has
a
kinase
activity
for

ribosomal
protein
kinase
and
eukaryotic
translation

.

These
proteins
,
when
phosphorylated
,
promote

transcription
in
the
nutrient-rich
condition
.

mTOR
inhibitors
such
as
Temsirolimus
(
CCI779
)
and
Everolimus
(
RAD001
)
are
effective
for
suppressing
cell
growth
with
inhibiting
mTOR
kinase
activity
.

Rapamycin
and
its
related
analogs
such
as
Temsirolimus
and
Everolimus
are
less
toxic
for
humans
compared
with
other
anti-VEGFR
inhibitors
and
has
been
used
as
an
immunosuppressive
agent
.

These
agents
have
an
inhibitory
activity
against
the
mTORC1
complex
.

Since
they
do
not
have
inhibitory
activity
against
mTORC2
complex
,
the
ability
of
mTOR
inhibition
by
Temsirolimus
is
supposed
to
be
40
to
50%
of
full
inhibition
in
mTOR
kinase
.

Temsirolimus
has
modest
anticancer
activity
against
advanced
clinical
RCC
patients
with
poor
risk
.

The
objective
response
rate
was
only
7%
,
26%
of
patients
experienced
minor
responses
and
another
17%
of

had
stable
disease
that
lasted
6
months
.

The
median

progression
and
median
survival
for
the

patients
were

,
respectively
.

The
overall
survival
of

alone
was
statistically
longer
than
in
those
treated
with
IFN
alone
in
the

cases

)
,
as
a
model
antigen
.

Peptide-loaded
PLGA
NPs
were
prepared
by
a
double
emulsion
/
solvent
evaporation
technique
.

Using
standard
conditions
(
acidic
inner
aqueous
phase
)
,
we
observed
that
either
encapsulation
was
very
low
(
1-30%
)
,
or
burst
release
extremely
high
(
>70%
)
upon
resuspension
of
NP
in
physiological
buffers
.

By
adjusting
formulation
and
process
parameters
,
we
uncovered
that
the
pH
of
the
first
emulsion
was
critical
to
efficient
encapsulation
and
controlled
release
.

In
particular
,
an
alkaline
inner
aqueous
phase
resulted
in
circa
330
nm
sized
NP
with
approximately
40%
encapsulation
efficiency
and
low
(
<10%
)
burst
release
.

These
NP
showed
enhanced
MHC
class
I
restricted
T
cell
activation
in
vitro
when
compared
to
high-burst
releasing
NP
and
soluble
OVA24
,
proving
that
efficient
entrapment
of
the
antigen
is
crucial
to
induce
a
potent
cellular
immune
response
.
Insmed
is
developing
mecasermin
rinfabate
,
a
recombinant
complex
of
insulin-like
growth
factor-I
(
rhIGF-I
)
and
binding
protein-3
(
rhIGFBP-3
)
[
insulin-like
growth
factor-I
/
insulin-like
growth
factor
binding
protein-3
,
rhIGF-I
/
rhIGFBP-3
,
SomatoKine
]
,
for
a
number
of
metabolic
and
endocrine
indications
.

In
the
human
body
,
IGF-I
circulates
in
the
blood
bound
to
a
binding
protein-3
(
IGFBP-3
)
,
which
regulates
the
delivery
of
IGF-I
to
target
tissues
,
and
particular
proteases
clip
them
apart
in
response
to
stresses
and
release
IGF-I
as
needed
.

IGF-I
,
a
naturally
occurring
hormone
,
is
necessary
for
normal
growth
and
metabolism
.

For
the
treatment
of
IGF-I
deficiency
,
it
is
desirable
to
administer
IGF-I
bound
to
IGFBP-3
to
maintain
the
normal
equilibrium
of
these
proteins
in
the
blood
.

Mecasermin
rinfabate
(
rhIGF-I
/
rhIGFBP-3
)
mimics
the
effects
of
the
natural
protein
complex
in
the
bloodstream
and
would
augment
the
natural
supply
of
these
linked
compounds
.

The
most
advanced
indication
in
development
of
mecasermin
rinfabate
is
the
treatment
of
severe
growth
disorders
due
to
growth
hormone
insensitivity
syndrome
(
GHIS
)
,
also
called
Laron
syndrome
.

GHIS
is
a
genetic
condition
in
which
patients
do
not
produce
adequate
quantities
of
IGF
because
of
a
failure
to
respond
to
the
growth
hormone
signal
.

This
results
in
a
slower
growth
rate
and
short
stature
.

Mecasermin
rinfabate
also
has
potential
as
replacement
therapy
for
IGF-I
,
which
may
become
depleted
in
indications
such
as
major
surgery
,
organ
damage
/
failure
,
traumatic
injury
,
cachexia
and
severe
burn
trauma
.

It
also
has
potential
for
the
treatment
of
osteoporosis
.

Mecasermin
rinfabate
was
developed
by
Celtrix
using
its
proprietary
recombinant
protein
production
technology
.

Subsequently
,
Celtrix
was
acquired
by
Insmed
Pharmaceuticals
on
1
June
2000
.

Insmed
and
Avecia
of
the
UK
have
signed
an
agreement
for
manufacturing
mecasermin
rinfabate
and
its
components
,
rhIGF-1
and
rhIGFBP-3
.

CGMP
clinical
production
of
mecasermin
rinfabate
and
its
components
will
be
carried
out
in
Avecia's
Advanced
Biologics
Centre
,
Billingham
,
UK
,
which
manufactures
recombinant-based
medicines
and
vaccines
at
the
capacity
of
up
to
1000L
.

In
April
2004
,
Insmed
announced
that
it
acquired
a
lease
to
operate
the
manufacturing
facility
formerly
operated
by
Baxter
for
the
commercial
production
of
SomatoKine
in
Boulder
,
CO
,
USA
.

With
the
two
manufacturing
facilities
for
SomatoKine
,
Insmed
plans
to
meet
the
development
and
commercial
demands
for
the
product
over
the
next
several
years
.

In
its
2003
Form-10K
,
Insmed
announced
plans
to
conduct
comparative
studies
with
the
previously
used
drug
substance
and
the
new
substance
produced
by
Avecia
.

The
comparative
data
will
be
included
in
the
regulatory
filing
for
mecasermin
rinfabate
.

Mecasermin
rinfabate
was
originally
licensed
to
Welfide
for
Japan
.

On
1
October
2001
,
Welfide
Corporation
merged
with
Mitsubishi-Tokyo
Pharmaceuticals
to
form
Mitsubishi
Pharma
Corporation
.

The
new
company
is
a
subsidiary
of
Mitsubishi
Chemical
.

In
October
2004
,
Insmed
announced
that
Tzamal
Pharma
has
been
granted
exclusive
distribution
and
marketing
rights
for
mecasermin
rinfabate
in
certain
Middle
Eastern
territories
including
Israel
.

Tzamal
Pharma
also
acquired
exclusive
rights
to
Insmed's
named
patient
programme
for
the
agent
in
these
territories
.

Tzamal
Pharma
intends
to
begin
the
appropriate
registration
activities
for
mecasermin
rinfabate
in
the
treatment
of
children
with
growth
hormone-insensitivity
syndrome
.

This
pivotal
,
12-month
,
multicentre
,
open-label
trial
in
30
children
with
GHIS
was
initiated
in
June
2003
and
was
designed
to
evaluate
the
safety
and
efficacy
of
the
agent
in
prepubescent
children
with
GHIS
.

The
6-month
endpoint
data
analysis
showed
that
mecasermin
rinfabate
given
as
a
once-daily
injection
was
safe
and
well
tolerated
.

The
agent
demonstrated
a
significant
increase
in
height
velocity
in
children
with
GHIS
similar
to
that
observed
by
Pfizer
in
their
pivotal
study
with
twice-daily
injections
of
rhIGF-I
.

The
full
results
from
the
pivotal
trial
are
expected
in
2005
.

In
April
2003
Insmed
initiated
a
named
patient
programme
in
Europe
that
will
make
available
mecasermin
rinfabate
for
the
treatment
of
GHIS-Laron
syndrome
.

The
treatment
of
patients
was
initiated
in
Scandinavia
,
with
authorisation
pending
in
several
other
European
countries
.

Mecasermin
rinfabate
will
be
made
available
to
those
GHIS
patients
who
,
in
the
opinion
of
their
doctor
,
may
benefit
from
IGF-I
therapy
.

At
precommercial
scale
quantities
,
the
drug
will
be
available
on
a
limited
basis
.

A
phase
II
dose-ranging
study
in
children
with
GHIS
was
completed
at
Saint
Bartholomew's
and
the
Royal
London
School
of
Medicine
,
London
,
UK
.

A
single
dose
of
mecasermin
rinfabate
delivered
the
same
amount
of
IGF-1
as
two
daily
injections
of
unbound
IGF-1
.

No
adverse
events
were
reported
.

Insmed
has
acquired
an
exclusive
licence
to
Pharmacia's
regulatory
filings
concerning
yeast-derived
insulin-like
growth
factor
1
(
IGF-1
)
.

These
filings
were
used
by
Pharmacia
to
receive
marketing
approvals
in
several
European
countries
and
also
in
the
IND
application
with
the
US
FDA
.

Insmed
believes
that
this
licence
will
facilitate
the
development
of
mecasermin
rinfabate
for
the
treatment
of
children
with
GHIS
.

In
January
2003
,
Insmed
announced
positive
results
from
a
double-blind
,
placebo-controlled
,
dose-ranging
study
of
mecasermin
rinfabate
in
adolescent
patients
with
type
1
diabetes
receiving
insulin
therapy
.

The
study
was
conducted
at
the
University
of
Cambridge
,
Cambridge
,
UK
,
under
supervision
of
Prof
.

D

Delovitch
,
the

have
found
that
mecasermin
rinfabate
complex
was
significantly
more
effective
than
IGF-1
in
reducing
the
severity
of
insulitis
,
beta
cell
destruction
and
delaying
the
onset
of
type
1
diabetes
.

The
study
was
supported
by
grants
from
Canadian
Institutes
of
Health
and
the
Juvenile
Diabetes
Research
Foundation
.

Insmed
plans
to
initiate
large-scale
phase
II
clinical
studies
in
this
indication
.

At
the
BIO
2004
Annual
International
Convention
(
BIO-2004
)
in
June
2004
,
Insmed
announced
that
it
has
received
a
grant
from
the
US
National
Institutes
of
Health
(
NIH
)
/
Muscular
Dystrophy
Association
(
MDA
)
worth
USD
$6
.
5
million
to
investigate
the
efficacy
of
mecasermin
rinfabate
for
the
treatment
of
myotonic
dystrophy
.

It
has
also
been
granted
orphan
drug
status
for
the
treatment
of
GHIS-Laron
syndrome
in
the
US
and
Europe
.

In
December
2003
,
Insmed
announced
that
mecasermin
rinfabate
was
designated
orphan
drug
status
by
the
FDA
for
the
treatment
of
extreme
insulin
resistance
.

This
provides
Insmed
with
7
years
of
market
exclusivity
following
approval
of
mecasermin
rinfabate
for
this
indication
.

Insmed
has
received
orphan
drug
designation
for
mecasermin
rinfabate
in
the
treatment
of
extreme
insulin
resistance
in
Europe
(
October
2004
)
.

In
November
2004
,
Insmed
was
granted
the
European
patent
EP1183042
entitled
"Methods
for
Treating
Diabetes"
.

This
patent
corresponds
with
the
US
patent
US
6
,
040
,
292
also
entitled
"Methods
for
Treating
Diabetes"
.

Both
patents
cover
type
1
and
type
2
diabetes
mellitus
and
insulin
resistant
diabetes
including
type
A
insulin
resistance
(
the
least
severe
form
of
extreme
insulin
resistance
syndromes
)
.

In
January
2004
,
Insmed
obtained
a
non-exclusive
licence
to
the
patents
for
use
of
IGF-I
for
the
treatment
of
extreme
or
severe
insulin-resistant
diabetes
from
Fujisawa
Pharmaceutical
.

Insmed
will
have
worldwide
rights
in
territories
(
excluding
Japan
)
with
existing
valid
patent
claims
including
the
US
and
Europe
.

Insmed
holds
28
US
issued
or
allowed
patents
for
the
composition
,
production
,
antibodies
and
methods
of
use
of
mecasermin
rinfabate
.

These
US
patents
expire
at
various
times
between
the
years
2010
and
2019
.

Insmed
through
their
lawyers
filed
its
defense
and
counterclaim
to
the
alleged
patent
infringement
brought
by
Tercica
against
Insmed
in
the
London
High
Court
of
Justice
.

Insmed
asserted
that
it
did
not
infringe
any
valid
patent
claims
as
none
of
the
claims
of
the
patent
were
patentable
because
the
subject
matter
was
not
new
.

Insmed
also
stated
that
the
patent
did
not
involve
an
inventive
step
,
did
not
have
capability
of
industrial
application
and
had
no
clear
description
of
the
invention
so
that
invention
can
be
performed
by
the
person
skilled
in
the
art
.

Insmed
is
seeking
revocation
of
the
patent
on
these
grounds
.
Acetaminophen
poisoning
is
the
most
frequent
cause
of
acute
hepatic
failure
in
the
US
.

Toxicity
requires
reductive
metabolism
of
acetaminophen
,
primarily
via
CYP2E1
.

Liquid
acetaminophen
preparations
contain
propylene
glycol
,
a
common
excipient
that
has
been
shown
to
reduce
hepatocellular
injury
in
vitro
and
in
rodents
.

Children
are
less
susceptible
to
acetaminophen
toxicity
for
unclear
reasons
.

We
conducted
a
pharmacokinetic
single-blinded
crossover
study
of
15
healthy
adult
volunteers
comparing
the
CYP2E1
and
conjugative
metabolism
of
a
15
mg
/
kg
dose
of
liquid
versus
solid
preparations
of
acetaminophen
.

Measured
AUC's
for
the
CYP2E1
metabolites
were
16-17%
lower
and
extrapolated
AUC's
were
25-28%
lower
in
the
liquid
formulation
arm
while
there
was
no
difference
in
conjugative
metabolite
production
.

The
formation
rate
constants
for
reductive
metabolites
were
equivalent
between
solid
and
liquid
formulations
indicating
that
enzyme
inhibition
was
competitive
.

Propylene
glycol
,
an
established
CYP2E1
competitive
antagonist
,
was
detected
in
the
liquid
formulation
but
not
solid
formulation
arm
.

Since
children
tend
to
ingest
liquid
preparations
,
the
protective
effect
of
this
excipient
could
explain
their
decreased
susceptibility
to
acetaminophen
toxicity
.

A
less
hepatotoxic
formulation
of
acetaminophen
could
potentially
be
developed
if
co-formulated
with
a
CYP2E1
inhibitor
.

Normotensive

served
as

.

In

vascular
responses
of
the
descending
aorta
and
renal
artery
were
studied
using

system
.

mREN2
rats
developed
pronounced
hypertension
which
was
associated
with
impaired
endothelium-dependent
and
endothelium-independent
vascular
relaxations
in
the
aorta
.

In
contrast
,
the
relaxation
responses
of
the

remained
largely
unchanged
in
mREN2
rats
.

Urinary

,
excretion
,
a
marker
of

,
was
also
decreased
in
mREN2
rats
.

Neither

nor

capable
of
preventing
Ang

,
whereas
ATi

losartan
completely
normalized

vascular

as
well
as

Our

indicate
that

as
well
as
the
sensitivity
of
arterial
smooth

cells
to
NO
are
decreased
in

The
present

also
demonstrated
that

not
play
a
central

in
the

of
Ang

Owing

the

This

an

Increased
sympathetic

activity
contributes
to
deoxycorticosterone

(
DOCA
)
-salt
hypertension
in
rats
.

ATP
and
norepinephrine
(
NE
)
are
coreleased
from
perivascular
sympathetic
nerves
.

NE
acts
at
prejunctional
α2-adrenergic
receptors
(
α2ARs
)
to
inhibit
NE
release
,
and
α2AR
function
is
impaired
in
DOCA-salt
rats
.

Adenosine
,
an
enzymatic
ATP
degradation
product
,
acts
at
prejunctional
A1
adenosine
receptors
(
A1Rs
)
to
inhibit
NE
release
.

We
tested
the
hypothesis
that
prejunctional
A1R
function
is
impaired
in
sympathetic
nerves
supplying
mesenteric
arteries
(
MAs
)
and
veins
(
MVs
)
of
DOCA-salt
rats
.

Electrically
evoked
NE

of
blood

were
studied
in

with
use
of
amperometry
to
measure
NE

,
respectively
.

Immunohistochemical
methods
were
used
to

(

)
inhibited
neurogenic
constrictions
and
NE
release
in
MAs
and

.

DOCA-salt

were
resistant
to
adenosine
and
CPA-mediated
inhibition
of

.

did
not
alter

.

We
conclude
that
there
are
prejunctional
A1Rs
in
arteries
and
both
pre-
and
postjunctional
A1Rs
in
veins;
thus
,
adenosine
selectively
constricts
the
veins
.

Prejunctional
A1R
function
is
impaired
in
arteries
,
but
not
veins
,
from
DOCA-salt

.

Sympathetic

is
not
specific
to
α2ARs

there
is
a
more
general
disruption
of
prejunctional
mechanisms

OBJECTIVE
:
Preclinical
evaluation
of
DRF
2655
,
a
peroxisome
proliferator-activated
receptor
alpha
(
PPARalpha
)
and
PPARgamma
agonist
,
as
a
body-weight
lowering
,
hypolipidemic
and
euglycemic
agent
.

RESEARCH
METHODS
AND
PROCEDURES
:
DRF
2655
was
studied
in
different
genetic
,
normal
,
and
hyperlipidemic
animal
models
.

HEK
293
cells
were
used
to
conduct
the
reporter-based
transactivation
of
PPARalpha
and
PPARgamma
.

To
understand
the
biochemical
mechanism
of
lipid-
,
body-weight-
,
and
glucose-lowering
effects
,
activities
of
key
beta-oxidation
and
lipid
catabolism
enzymes
and
gluconeogenic
enzymes
were
studied
in
db
/
db
mice
treated
with
DRF
2655
.

3T3L1
cells
were
used
for
adipogenesis
study
,
and
HepG2
cells
were
used
to
study
the
effect
of
DRF
2655
on
total
cholesterol
and
triglyceride
synthesis
using
[
(

)
C
]

and

glycerol
.

RESULTS
:
DRF
2655
showed
concentration-dependent
transactivation
of
PPARalpha
and
PPARgamma
.

In
the
3T3L1
cell-differentiation
study
,
DRF
2655
and
rosiglitazone
showed
369%
and
471%
increases
,
respectively
,
in
triglyceride
accumulation
.

DRF
2655
showed
body-weight
lowering
and
euglycemic
and
hypolipidemic
effects
in
various
animal
models
.

treated
with
DRF
2655
showed
5-
and
3
.
6-fold
inhibition
in
phosphoenolpyruvate
carboxykinase
and
glucose
6-phosphatase
activity
and
651%
and
77%
increases
in
the
beta-oxidation
enzymes
carnitine
palmitoyltransferase
and
carnitine
acetyltransferase
,
respectively
.

HepG2
cells
treated
with
DRF
2655
showed
significant
reduction
in
lipid
synthesis
.

DISCUSSION
:
DRF
2655
showed
excellent
euglycemic
and
hypolipidemic
activities
in
different
animal
models
.

An
exciting
finding
is
its
body-weight
lowering
effect
in
these
models
,
which
might
be
mediated
by
the
induction
of
target
enzymes
involved
in
hepatic
lipid
catabolism
through
PPARalpha
activation
.
D-Serine
was
previously
identified
in
mammalian
brain
and
was
shown
to
be
a
co-agonist
at
the
'glycine'
site
of
the
N-methyl-D-aspartate
(
NMDA
)
-type
receptors
.

Racemization
of
serine
is
catalyzed
by
serine
racemase
,
a
pyridoxal
5'-phosphate-dependent
enzyme
expressed
mainly
in
brain
and
liver
.

NMDA
receptor
overactivation
has
been
implicated
in
a
number
of
pathological
conditions
and
inhibitors
of
serine
racemase
are
thus
potentially
interesting
targets
for
therapy
.

We
expressed
recombinant
mouse
serine
racemase
in
insect
cells
and
purified
it
to
near
homogeneity
.

The
enzyme
is
a
non-covalent
homodimer
in
solution
and
requires
divalent
cations
Mg
(
2
+
)
,
Ca
(
2
+
)
or
Mn
(
2
+
)
for
activity
but
not
for
dimerization
.

In
addition
to
the
racemization
it
also
catalyzes
specific
elimination
of
L-Ser
to
pyruvate
.

D-Serine
is
eliminated
much
less
efficiently
.

Both
L-serine
racemization
and
elimination
activities
of
serine
racemase
are
of
comparable
magnitude
,
display
alkaline
pH
optimum
and
are
negligible
below
pH

We
report
an
injectable
hydrogel
system
that
incorporates
interferon-α2a
(
IFN-α2a
)
for
liver
cancer
therapy
.

IFN-α2a
was
incorporated
in
hydrogels
composed
of
hyaluronic
acid-tyramine
(
HA-Tyr
)
conjugates
through
the
oxidative
coupling
of
Tyr
moieties
with
hydrogen
peroxide
(
H2O2
)
and
horseradish
peroxidase
(
HRP
)
.

IFN-α2a-incorporated
HA-Tyr
hydrogels
of
varying
stiffness
were
formed
by
changing
the
H2O2
concentration
.

The
incorporation
of
IFN-α2a
did
not
affect
the
rheological
properties
of
the
hydrogels
.

The
activity
of
IFN-α2a
was
furthermore
well-maintained
in
the
hydrogels
with
lower
stiffness
.

Through
the
caspase-3
/
7
pathway
in
vitro
,
IFN-α2a
released
from
HA-Tyr
hydrogels
inhibited
the
proliferation
of
liver
cancer
cells
and
induced
apoptosis
.

In
the
study
of
the
pharmacokinetics
,
a
higher
concentration
of
IFN-α2a
was
shown
in
the
plasma
of
mice
treated
with
IFN-α2a-incorporated
hydrogels
after
4h
post
injection
,
with
a
much
higher
amount
of
IFN-α2a
delivered
at
the
tumor
tissue
comparing
to
that
of
injecting
an
IFN-α2a
solution
.

The
tumor
regression
study
revealed
that
IFN-α2a-incorporated
HA-Tyr
hydrogels
effectively
inhibited
tumor
growth
,
while
the
injection
of
an
IFN-α2a
solution
did
not
demonstrate
antitumor
efficacy
.

Histological
studies
confirmed
that
tumor
tissues
in
mice
treated
with
IFN-α2a-incorporated
HA-Tyr
hydrogels
showed
lower
cell
density
,
with
more
apoptotic
and
less
proliferating
cells
compared
with
tissues
treated
with
an
IFN-α2a
solution
.

In
addition
,
the
IFN-α2a-incorporated
hydrogel
treatment
greatly
inhibited
the
angiogenesis
of
tumor
tissues
.
Peptides
from
the
venom
ducts
of
cone
snails
(
genus
Conus
)
contain
gamma-carboxyglutamate
residues
.

The
gamma-glutamyl
carboxylase
responsible
for
this
post-translational
modification
is
localized
in
the
microsomal
fraction
,
strictly
dependent
on
vitamin
K
,
activated
by
ammonium
sulfate
,
and
is
associated
with
endogenous
substrate
.

The
K
(
m
)
of
the
enzyme
for
vitamin
K
is
comparable
to
that
for
the
bovine
carboxylase
.

However
,
a
propeptide
containing
substrate
related
to
the
blood
coagulation
protein
factor
IX
,
a
highly
efficient
substrate
for
the
bovine
enzyme
,
was
poorly
carboxylated
by
the
Conus
enzyme
,
suggesting
differences
in
gamma-carboxylase
recognition
signal
sequences
and
/
or
structural
requirements
at
the
carboxylation
site
.

Activation-induced
cytidine
deaminase
(
AID
)
is
a
DNA
mutator
enzyme
essential
for
adaptive
immunity
.

AID
initiates
somatic
hypermutation
and
class
switch
recombination
(
CSR
)
by
deaminating
cytosine
to
uracil
in
specific
immunoglobulin
(
Ig
)
gene
regions
.

However
,
other
loci
,
including
cancer-related
genes
,
are
also
targeted
.

Thus
,
tight
regulation
of
AID
is
crucial
to
balance
immunity
versus
disease
such
as
cancer
.

AID
is
regulated
by
several
mechanisms
including
nucleocytoplasmic
shuttling
.

Here
we
have
studied
nuclear
import
kinetics
and
subnuclear
trafficking
of
AID
in
live
cells
and
characterized
in
detail
its
nuclear
localization
signal
.

Importantly
,
we
find
that
the
nuclear
localization
signal
motif
also
directs
AID
to
nucleoli
where
it
colocalizes
with
its
interaction
partner
,
catenin-β-like
1
(
CTNNBL1
)
,
and
physically
associates
with
nucleolin
and
nucleophosmin
.

Moreover
,
we
demonstrate
that
release
of
AID
from
nucleoli
is
dependent
on
its
C-terminal
motif
.

Finally
,
we
find
that
CSR
efficiency
correlates
strongly
with
the
arithmetic
product
of
AID
nuclear
import
rate
and
DNA
deamination
activity
.

Our
findings
suggest
that
directional
nucleolar
transit
is
important
for
the
physiological
function
of
AID
and
demonstrate
that
nuclear
/
nucleolar
import
and
DNA
cytosine
deamination
together
define
the
biological
activity
of
AID
.

This
is
the
first
study
on
subnuclear
trafficking
of
AID
and
demonstrates
a
new
level
in
its
complex
regulation
.

In
addition
,
our
results
resolve
the
problem
related
to
dissociation
of
deamination
activity
and
CSR
activity
of
AID
mutants
.

Kidney

molecule-1
(
KIM-1

has
been
qualified
by
the
Food
and
Drug
Administration
and
European
Medicines
Agency
as
a
urinary
biomarker
to
monitor
preclinical
nephrotoxicity
in
rats
and
on
a
case-by-case
basis
for
the
translation
of
potentially
nephrotoxic
drugs
into
first-in
human
studies
.

Although
mouse
models
are
widely
employed
in
preclinical
studies
,
few
urinary
biomarker
studies
have
been
performed
in
mice
due
to
limited
urine
availability
and
lack
of
sensitive
assays
.

Here
,
we
report
the
development
and
validation
of
two
different
assays
for
quantitative
assessment
of
mouse
urinary
KIM-1
(
uKIM-1
)
and
compare
the
sensitivity
of
KIM-1
relative
to
other
standard
markers
in
ischemia

and
aristolochic

(

)
-induced

injury
in
mice
.

A
sensitive
,
reproducible
,
and
quantitative
microbead-based
KIM-1
ELISA
was
established
,
which
requires
only
10
μl
urine
for
triplicate
determination
with
an
assay
range
of
12
.
21
pg
/
ml
to
50
ng
/

.

The
second
assay
is
a
laminar
flow
dipstick
assay
,
which
has
an
assay
range
of
195
pg
/
ml
to
50
ng
/
ml
and
provides
quantitative
assessment
of
KIM-1
in
15
min
.

uKIM-1
levels
increased
with
increasing
time
of
ischemia
or
time
after
AA
administration
.

After
only
10-min
ischemia
followed
by
24-h
reperfusion
,
uKIM-1
was
significantly
elevated
by
13-fold
,
whereas
serum
creatinine
(
sCr
)
,
blood
urea
nitrogen
,
N-acetyl-β-glucosaminidase
(
NAG
)
,
and
proteinuria
levels
did
not
change
.

After
AA
administration
,
uKIM-1
levels
were
significantly
upregulated
by
greater
than
threefold
within
12
h
,
whereas
sCr
and
NAG
levels
were
unchanged
.

Mouse
KIM-1
was
stable
for

freeze-thaw
cycles
,
for
up
to
5
days
at

temperature
and
up
to
at

The
anticonvulsant
felbamate
blocks
N-methyl-D-asparate
(
NMDA
)
receptors
but
fails
to
exhibit
the
neurobehavioral
toxicity
characteristic
of
other
NMDA
receptor
antagonists
.

To
investigate
the
possibility
that
felbamate's
favorable
toxicity
profile
could
be
related
to
NMDA
receptor
subtype
selectivity
,
we
examined
the
specificity
of
felbamate
block
of
recombinant
NMDA
receptors
composed
of
the
NR1a
subunit
and
various
NR2
subunits
.

Felbamate
produced
a
rapid
,
concentration-dependent
block
of
currents
evoked
by
50
microM
NMDA
and
10
microM
glycine
in
human
embryonic
kidney
293
cells
expressing
the
rat
NR1a
subunit
,
and
either
the
NR2A
,
NR2B
or
NR2C
subunits;
the
IC50
values
for
block
were
2
.
6
,
0
.
52
and
2
.
4
mM
,
respectively
(
holding
potential
,
-
60
mV
)
.

The
Hill
coefficient
values
were
<
1
and
,
in
kinetic
analyses
,
onset
and
recovery
from
block
were
well
fit
by
double
exponential
functions
,
indicating
binding
to
more
than
one
blocking
site
on
the
NMDA
receptor
channel
complex
.

The
higher
affinity
of
felbamate
block
of
NMDA
receptors
containing
the
NR2B
subunit
could
be
accounted
for
by
more
rapid
association
and
slower
dissociation
from
these
sites
.

We
conclude
that
felbamate
exhibits
modest
selectivity
for
NMDA
receptors
composed
of
NR1a
/
NR2B
subunits
.

This
selectivity
could
,
in
part
,
account
for
the
more
favorable
clinical
profile
of
felbamate
in
comparison
with
NMDA
receptor
antagonists
that
do
not
show
subunit

The
topoisomerase
II
inhibitor
amsacrine
is
used
in
the
treatment
of
acute
myelogenous
leukemia
.

Although
most
anticancer
drugs
are
believed
not
to
cause
acquired
long
QT
syndrome
(
LQTS
)
,
concerns
have
been
raised
by
reports
of
QT
interval
prolongation
,
ventricular
fibrillation
and
death
associated
with
amsacrine
treatment
.

Since
blockade
of
cardiac
human
ether-a-go-go-related
gene
(
HERG
)
potassium
currents
is
an
important
cause
of
acquired
LQTS
,
we
investigated
the
acute
effects
of
amsacrine
on
cloned
HERG
channels
to
determine
the
electrophysiological
basis
for
its
proarrhythmic
potential
.

2
HERG
channels
were
heterologously
expressed
in
human
HEK
293
cells
and
Xenopus
laevis
oocytes
,
and
the
respective
potassium
currents
were
recorded
using
patch-clamp
and
two-microelectrode
voltage-clamp
electrophysiology
.

Amsacrine
blocked
HERG
currents
in
HEK
293
cells
and
Xenopus
oocytes
in
a
concentration-dependent
manner
,
with
IC50
values
of
209
.
4
nm
and
2
.
0
microm
,
respectively
.

4
HERG
channels
were
primarily
blocked
in
the
open
and
inactivated
states
,
and
no
additional
voltage
dependence
was
observed
.

Amsacrine
caused
a
negative
shift
in
the
voltage
dependence
of
both
activation
(
-7
.
6
mV
)
and
inactivation
(
-7
.
6
mV
)
.

HERG
current
block
by
amsacrine
was
not
frequency
dependent
.

HERG
current
blockade
,
indicating
that
amsacrine
binding
requires
a
common
drug
receptor
within
the
pore-S6
region
.

6
In
conclusion
,
these
data
demonstrate
that
the
anticancer
drug
amsacrine
is
an
antagonist
of
cloned
HERG
potassium
channels
,
providing
a
molecular
mechanism
for
the
previously
reported
QTc
interval
prolongation
during
clinical
administration
of
amsacrine
.

Human
serum
butyrylcholinesterase
(
HuBChE
)
is
currently
the
most
suitable
bioscavenger
for
the
prophylaxis
of
highly
toxic
organophosphate
(
OP
)
nerve
agents
.

A
dose
of
200mg
of
HuBChE
is
envisioned
as
a
prophylactic
treatment
that
can
protect
humans
from
an
exposure
of
up
to
2×LD50
of
soman
.

The
limited
availability
and
administration
of
multiple
doses
of
this
stoichiometric
bioscavenger
make
this
pretreatment
difficult
.

Thus
,
the
goal
of
this
study
was
to
produce
a
smaller
enzymatically
active
HuBChE
polypeptide
(
HBP
)
that
could
bind
to
nerve
agents
with
high
affinity
thereby
reducing
the
dose
of
enzyme
.

Studies
have
indicated
that
the
three-dimensional
structure
and
the
domains
of
HuBChE
(
acyl
pocket
,
lip
of
the
active
center
gorge
,
and
the
anionic
substrate-binding
domain
)
that
are
critical
for
the
binding
of
substrate
are
also
essential
for
the
selectivity
and
binding
of
inhibitors
including
OPs
.

Therefore
,
we
designed
three
HBPs
by
deleting
some
N-
and
C-terminal
residues
of
HuBChE
by
maintaining
the
folds
of
the
active
site
core
that
includes
the
three
active
site
residues
(
S198
,
E325
,
and
H438
)
.

HBP-4
that
lacks
45
residues
from
C-terminus
but
known
to
have
BChE
activity
was
used
as
a
control
.

The
cDNAs
for
the
HBPs
containing
signal
sequences
were
synthesized
,
cloned
into
different
mammalian
expression
vectors
,
and
recombinant
polypeptides
were
transiently
expressed
in
different
cell
lines
.

No
BChE
activity
was
detected
in
the
culture
media
of
cells
transfected
with
any
of
the
newly
designed
HBPs
,
and
the
inactive
polypeptides
remained
inside
the
cells
.

Only
enzymatically
active
HBP-4
was
secreted
into
the
culture
medium
.

These
results
suggest
that
residues
at
the
N-
and
C-termini
are
required
for
the
folding
and
/
or
maintenance
of
HBP
into
an
active
stable
,
conformation
.
The
Felidae
family
represents
a
challenge
for
molecular
phylogenetic
reconstruction
because
it
consists
of
38
living
species
that
evolved
from
a
relatively
recent
common
ancestor
(
10-15
million
years
ago
)
.

We
have
determined
mitochondrial
DNA
sequences
from
two
genes
that
evolve
at
relatively
rapid
evolutionary
rates
,
16S

(
379
bp
)
and
NADH
dehydrogenase
subunit
5
(
NADH-5
,
318
bp
)
,
from
multiple
individuals
of
35
species
.

Based
on
separate
and
combined
gene
analyses
using
minimum
evolution
,
maximum
parsimony
,
and
maximum
likelihood
phylogenetic
methods
,
we
recognized
eight
significant
clusters
or
species
clades
that
likely
reflect
separate
monophyletic
evolutionary
radiations
in
the
history
of
this
family
.

The
clusters
include
(
1
)
ocelot
lineage

and

cases

Evidence
exists
that
mu
analgesics
such
as
morphine
,
methadone
and
fentanyl
may
act
through
distinct
mu
opioid
receptor
mechanisms
.

It
has
been
proposed
that
the
functional
diversity
of
mu
opioid
receptors
may
be
related
to
alternative
splicing
of
the
Oprm
gene
.

Although
a
number
of
mu
opioid
receptor
mRNA
splice
variants
have
been
reported
,
their
biological
relevance
has
been
controversial
,
due
in
part
to
their
very
low
abundance
and
a
general
lack
of
validation
from
independent
laboratories
.

We
have
identified
11
of
17
proposed
exons
as
well
as
the
majority
of
exon
combinations
used
to
make
21
differentially
spliced
Oprm
mRNAs
from
mouse
whole
brain
cDNA
,
using
polymerase
chain
reaction
(
PCR
)
conditions
different
from
those
used
by
the
single
other
group
that
has
reported
multiple
splice
forms
.

Alternative
splicing
was
shown
to
occur
at
both
the
5'
and
3'
termini
.

Moreover
,
verification
of
a
short
variant
,
containing
exons
1
and
4
only
,
suggests
that
splicing
also
occurs
directly
between
5'
and
3'
exons
.

Notably
,
a
novel
splice
variant
,
MOR-1T
,
demonstrates
for
the
first
time
that
exon
4
can
be
used
in
combination
with
further
downstream
exons
to
make
the
3'-end
of
MOR-1
splice
variants
.

The
putative
protein
encoded
by
MOR-1T
is
predicted
to
be
identical
to
that
of
MOR-1
,
implying
that
the
MOR-1
protein
can
be
generated
from
at
least
five
differentially
spliced
mRNAs
.

Our
results
support
the
view
that
the
Oprm
gene
undergoes
extensive
alternative
splicing
,
as
a
likely
major
contributor
to
the
diversity
of
mu
opioid
receptors
.
Aldehyde
dehydrogenase
1
(
ALDH1A1
)
catalyzes
the
oxidation
of
toxic
aldehydes
to
carboxylic
acids
.

Physiologic
levels
of
Mg
(
2
+
)
ions
decrease
ALDH1
activity
in
part
by
increasing
NADH
binding
affinity
to
the
enzyme
.

By
using
time-resolved
fluorescence
spectroscopy
,
we
have
resolved
the
fluorescent
lifetimes
(
τ
)
of
free
NADH
in
solution
(
τ
=
0
.
4
ns
)
and
two
enzyme-bound
NADH
states
(
τ
=
2
.
0
ns
and
τ
=
7
.
7
ns
)
.

We
used
this
technique
to
investigate
the
effects
of
Mg
(
2
+
)
ions
on
the
ALDH1A1-NADH
binding
characteristics
and
enzyme
catalysis
.

From
the
resolved
free
and
bound
NADH
fluorescence
signatures
,
the
KD
values
for
both
NADH
conformations
in
ALDH1A1
ranged
from
about
24
μM
to
1
μM
for
Mg
(
2
+
)
ion
concentrations
of
0-6000
μM
,
respectively
.

The
rate
constants
for
dissociation
of
the
enzyme-NADH
complex
ranged
from
0
.
03
s
(
-1
)
(
6000
μM
Mg
(
2

)
)
to
0
.
30s
(
-1
)
(
0
μM
Mg
(
2

)
)
as
determined
by
addition
of
excess
NAD
(
+
)
to
prevent
re-association
of
NADH
and
resolving
the
real-time
NADH
fluorescence
signal
.

During
the
initial
reaction
of
enzyme
with
NAD
(
+
)
and
butyraldehyde
,
there
was
an
immediate
rise
in
the
NADH
fluorescence
,
due
to
the
formation
of
bound
NADH
complexes
,
with
a
constant
steady-state
rate
of
production
of
free
NADH
.

As
the
Mg
(
2
+
)
ion
concentration
was
increased
,
there
was
a
consistent
decrease
of
the
enzyme
catalytic
turnover
from
0
.
31
s
(
-1
)
(
0
μM
Mg
(
2

)
)
to
0
.
050
s
(
-1
)
(
6000
μM
Mg
(
2
+
)
)
and
a
distinct
shift
in
steady-state
conformational
population
from
one
that
favors
the
ALDH1-NADH
complex
with
the
shorter
fluorescence
lifetime
(
33%
excess
)
in
the
absence
of
magnesium
ion
to
one
that
favors
the
ALDH1-NADH
complex
with
the
longer
fluorescence
lifetime
(
13%
excess
)
at
6000
μM
Mg
(
2
+
)
.

This
shift
in
conformational
population
at
higher
Mg
(
2
+
)
ion
concentrations
and
to
lower
enzyme
activity
may
be
due
to
longer
residence
time
of
the
NADH
in
the
ALDH1
pocket
.

The
results
from
monitoring
enzyme
catalysis
in
the
absence
of
magnesium
suggests
that
the
ALDH1-NADH
complex
with
the
shorter
fluorescence
lifetime
is
the
form
initially
produced
,
and
the
complex
with
the
longer
fluorescence
lifetime
is
produced
through
isomerization
.
Passive

for
Arsenic
trioxide
(
ATO
)
is
widely
used
in
tumor
treatment
,
but
excessive
arsenic
exposure
can
have
adverse
effects
.

We
recently
found
that
,
in
primary
osteoblasts
,
ATO
produces
oxidative
stress
and
causes
DNA
tailing
,
but
does
not
induce
apoptosis
.

We
further
examined
the
signaling
pathway
by
which
osteoblasts
survive
ATO
treatment
,
and
found
that
they
were
arrested
at
G2
/
M
phase
of
the
cell
cycle
at
30h
and
overrode
the
G2
/
M
boundary
at
48h
.

After
treatment
for
30h
,
there
was
increased
Cdc2
phosphorylation
and
expression
of
Wee1
,
a
Cdc2
kinase
,
and
expression
of
the
cell
cycle
inhibitor
,
p21
(
waf1
/
cip1
)
,
which
interacts
with
Cdc2
.

Furthermore
,
levels
of
the
phosphatase
Cdc25C
,
which
activates
Cdc2
,
were
decreased
,
while
the
ratio
of
its
phosphorylated
/
inactivated
form
to
the
total
amount
was
increased
.

Moreover
,
phosphorylation
/
activation
of
the
checkpoint
kinases
Chk1
,
Chk2
and
p53
levels
were
increased
,
as
were
levels
of
activated
ATM
and
γ-H2AX
.

The
cell
viability
was
decreased
as
an
ATM
inhibitor
was
added
.

Additionally
,
these
effects
of
ATO
on
γ-H2AX
,
Chk1
,
Chk2
,
p53
,
and
p21
(
waf1
/
cip1
)
were
reduced
by
an
ATM
inhibitor
.

These
findings
suggest
that
G2
/
M
phase
arrest
of
osteoblasts
is
mediated
by
Chk1
/
Chk2
activation
via
an
ATM-dependent
pathway
by
which
osteoblasts
survive
.

Net
hepatic

We

that
NHGU
is
reduced

normal
pregnancy
and
in
a
pregnant
diet-induced
model
of
impaired
glucose
intolerance
/
gestational

.

Dogs
(

)
that
were
nonpregnant
(
N
)
,
normal

(
P
)
,
or
pregnant
with

The

within
30
min;
mean
±
SEM
NHGU
was
105

.

The
P
and
P-HFF
dogs
reached
maximal
NHGU
in
90-120
min;
their
NHGU
was
blunted
(
68
±
9
and
16
±
17
µmol·100

liver⁻¹·min⁻¹
,
respectively
)
.

Hepatic
glycogen
synthesis
was
reduced
20%
in
P
versus
N
and
40%
in
P-HFF
versus
P
dogs
.

This
was
associated
with
a
reduction
(
>70%
)
in
glycogen
synthase
activity
in
P-HFF
versus
P
and
increased
glycogen
phosphorylase
(
GP
)
activity
in
both
P

.
7-fold
greater
than
N
)
and
P-HFF
(
1
.
8-fold
greater
than

.

Thus
,
NHGU
under
conditions
mimicking
the
postprandial
state
is
delayed
and
suppressed
in
normal
pregnancy
,
with
concomitant
reduction
in
glycogen
storage
.

NHGU
is
further
blunted
in
IGT

This
likely
contributes
to
postprandial
hyperglycemia
during

with
potential
adverse
outcomes
for
the

The
elevation
in

activity
in

animals
is
accompanied
by
an
increase
of
11-

in
the
levels
of
AFAR
protein
in

from

,
respectively
.

The
amount
of
AFAR
protein
in
selenium-sufficient
and
-deficient
Fischer
rats
was
modulated
by
treatment
with
N-acetylcysteine;
this
antioxidant
reduced
basal
expression
of
AFAR
but
did
not
modulate
the
relative
overexpression
of
AFAR
during

and
7-fold
increase
,
respectively
,
in
the
hepatic
levels
of
the
AFB1-metabolizing
alpha-class
GSTA5
subunit
.

The
elevated
levels
of
AFAR
and
GSTA5
protein
in
the
selenium-deficient
animals
coincided
with
increases
in
the
steady-state
levels
of
their
mRNAs
.

In
selenium-deficient
Fischer
344
rats
,
AFAR
and
GSTA5
were
both
found
to
be
expressed
throughout
the
centrilobular

midzonal
areas
of
the
liver
lobule
but
were
essentially
absent
from
periportal

.

The
effect
of
selenium
insufficiency
is
pleiotropic
,
and
it
was
also
noted
that

GSTT1
is
overexpressed
3-

10-fold
in

of
selenium-deficient
Hooded
Lister
and
Fischer
344

.

Inasmuch
as
GSTT1
is
responsible
for
the
metabolic
activation
of
dihaloalkanes

selenium

may
increase
the

Adult
humans
have
about
25
trillion
red
blood
cells
(
RBCs
)
,
and
each
second
we
recycle
about
5
million
RBCs
by
erythrophagocytosis
(
EP
)
in
macrophages
of
the
reticuloendothelial
system
.

Despite
the
central
role
for
EP
in
mammalian
iron
metabolism
,
the
molecules
and
pathways
responsible
for
heme
trafficking
during
EP
remain
unknown
.

Here
,
we
show
that
the
mammalian
homolog
of
HRG1
,
a
transmembrane
heme
permease
in
C
.

elegans
,
is
essential
for
macrophage
iron
homeostasis
and
transports
heme
from
the
phagolysosome
to
the
cytoplasm
during
EP
.

HRG1
is
strongly
expressed
in
macrophages
of
the
reticuloendothelial
system
and
specifically
localizes
to
the
phagolysosomal
membranes
during
EP
.

Depletion
of
Hrg1
in
mouse
macrophages
causes
attenuation
of
heme
transport
from
the
phagolysosomal
compartment

Importantly
,
missense
polymorphisms
in

HRG1
are
defective
in
heme
transport
.

Our
results
reveal
HRG1
as
the
long-sought
heme
transporter
for
heme-iron
recycling
in
macrophages
and
suggest
that
genetic
variations
in

.

It
was
found
that
a
single
intragastric
gavage
by
L-methionine
resulted
in
inhibition
of
endothelium-dependent
relaxation
,
markedly
increased
the
serum
level
of
malondialdehyde
and
decreased
the
activity
of
PON1
and

,
similarly
decreased
the
level
of

in
the
serum;
but
had
no
effects
on
endothelium-independent

and
angiotensin-converting

activity
compared
with
the

group
.

Given
the
treatment

)

attenuated

,
activity
of

SOD
in

However
,
there
were
some
significant
differences
among
Captopril
(
30
mg

45
mg

)
,
enalapril
(
20
mg

)
,
and
N-acetylcysteine
particular
in
the
activity
of
PON1

.

These
results
suggested
that
Captopril
can
protect
the
vascular
endothelium
against
the
damages
induced
by
L-methionine
in
rats
,
and
the
beneficial
effects
of
Captopril
may
be
related
to
attenuating
the
decrease

.

Furthermore

this

may
be
concerned
with
the

also
evaluated
.

The
difference
in
IC50

for

across

and
equations
ranged
from
a
minimum
of
20-

to
a
maximum
of

796-fold
for

respectively
.

For
telmisartan
and
verapamil
,
variability
was
greatly
influenced
by
data
from
one
laboratory
in
each
case
.

Excluding
these
two
data
sets
brings
the
range
in
IC50
values
for
telmisartan
and
verapamil
down
to
69-
and
159-fold
.

The
efflux
ratio
based-equation
generally
resulted
in
several
fold
lower
IC50
values
compared
to
unidirectional

.

Statistical
analysis
indicated
that
variability
in

was
mainly
due
to
inter-laboratory

,
rather
than
an
implicit
systematic

OBJECTIVE
:
The
following
study
was
performed
to
evaluate
the
importance
of
phosphodiesterases
3A
(
PDE3A
)
and
5A
(
PDE5A
)
for
the
regulation
of

.

Furthermore
,
indications
of
side
effects
of
specific
inhibitors

certain
tissues
as
well
as
of
a
possible
relation
between
the
level
of
PDE3A
and
PDE5A
gene
expression
and
erectile
dysfunction
should
have
been
deduced
from
the
results
obtained
.

METHODS
:
Total
ribonucleic
acid
was
isolated
from
different
human
tissues
(
urogenital
tract
,
gastrointestinal
tract
,
cardiovascular
system
and
central

system
)
and
subjected
to
RTPCR
analysis
and
Northern
blotting
using
primers
and
probes
specific
for
PDE3A
and
PDE5A
.

RESULTS
:
As
shown
by
RT-PCR
and
Northern
blotting
,
PDE3A
and
PDE5A
mRNAs
exhibit
a
distinct
distribution
throughout
the
tissues
examined
but
were
2-fold
higher
in
cavernous
tissue
than
in
all
other
tissues
investigated
.

However
,
there
were
no
significant
differences
in
the
levels
of
gene
expression
between
the
two
subgroups
of
patients
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
Very
high
expression
levels
of
PDE3A
and
PDE5A
in
human
cavernous
tissue
underscore
the
physiological
importance
of
these
enzymes
for
the
regulation
of
penile
erection
,
emphasizing
their
therapeutical
and
pharmacological
relevance
.

The
distribution
pattern
of
the
mRNA
for
the
isoenzymes
PDE3A
and
PDE5A
may
explain
the
pharmacological

To

,
the
affinities
of
22
ligands
for

have
been
compared
at
human

sites
(
analyzed
under

and
at
human
alpha-2A
,
alpha-2B
and

adrenoceptors
stably
expressed
on

Chinese
hamster
ovary
cells
.

Competition
curves
at
the
platelet
I1-imidazoline
binding
site
were
biphasic
for
most
compounds
.

Only
tizanidine
and
BDF
,
6143
displayed
monophasic
I1
competition
curves
.

Agmatine
,
an
endogenous
neurotransmitter
candidate
for
the
I1-imidazoline
receptor
,
was
identified
as
the
most
selective
agent
for
a
subcomponent
of
platelet
I1
sites
.

The
affinity
of
agmatine
at
the
high
affinity
component
of
platelet
I1
sites
was
1400-fold
selective
over
alpha-2A
adrenoceptors
,
5000-fold
selective
over
alpha-2B
adrenoceptors
and
800-fold
selective
over
alpha-2C
adrenoceptors
.

Moxonidine
and
tizanidine
also
displayed
selectivities
for
a
high
affinity
component
of
the
platelet
I1
binding
sites
over
alpha-2
adrenoceptors
.

Naphazoline
was
the
most
selective
compound
for
the
high
affinity
state
of
the
alpha-2A
adrenoceptor
,
displaying
7-
,
23-
and
9-fold
higher
affinity
than
alpha-2B
,
alpha-2C
and
platelet
I1-midazoline
binding
sites
,
respectively
.

No
single
selective
compound
was
identified
for
the
alpha-2B
adrenoceptor
.

Norepinephrine
displayed
,
respectively
,
18-
and
31-fold
selectivity
for
the
high
affinity
state
of
the
alpha-2C
adrenoceptor
as
compared
to
alpha-2A-
or
alpha-2B
adrenoceptors
,
and
was
>
100
,
000-
fold
selective
over
platelet
I1-imidazoline
sites
.

Thus
,
human
alpha-2
adrenoceptors

site
can
be
clearly
discriminated
based
on
their
affinities

Secretion
of

was
quantified
in
the
culture

by
ELISA
.

Basal
secretion
of
all
the
cytokines
was
not
altered
by
MWCNTs
in
PBMCs
from
both
healthy
donors
and
allergic
subjects
.

In
PBMCs
from
healthy
donors
,
TNF-α
,
IL-6
and
IL-12
/
23p40
secretion
in
response
to
the
TLR4
agonist
,
lipopolysaccharide
was
however
increased
in
a
dose-dependent
manner
by
MWCNTs
.

Significant
increases
in
the
release
of
these
cytokines
were
also
observed
in
PBMCs
stimulated
with
a
TLR2
or
TLR3
agonist
.

MWCNTs
also
increased
the
release
of
IL-2
and
IFN-γ
by
PBMCs
stimulated
with
a
T
cell
mitogen
.

In
contrast
,
MWCNTs
inhibited
allergen-induced
IL-5
secretion
by
PBMCs
from
mite-allergic
subjects
.

As
well
,
MWCNTs
altered
the
capacity
of
PBMC-derived
monocytes
to
differentiate
into
functional
dendritic
cells
.

All
together
,
our
data
suggest
that
according
to
its
immune
cell
target
,
MWCNTs
may
either
promote
or
suppress
immune
responses

Understanding
the
alterations
in
cellular
protein
interactions
and
their
relations
to
genetic
mutations
that
cause
renal

carcinoma
(
RCC
)
provides
a
unique
opportunity
for
the
development
of
disease-specific
therapy
for
patients
with
advanced
forms
of
this
disease
.

There
is
substantial
evidence
of
an
association
between
mutation
on
von
Hippel-Lindau
(
VHL
)
gene
and
the
earliest
stages
of
tumorigenesis
of
RCC
.

The
main
consequence
of
VHL
loss
is
the
upregulation
of
downstream
proangiogenic
factors
leading
to
highly
vascular
tumors
.

Overexpression
of
hypoxia
inducible

(

)
is

of
rapamycin
(
mTOR
)
,
a
key
component
of
signaling
pathways
inside
the
cell
,
involved
in
cell
proliferation
.

The
inhibition
of
proangiogenic
factors
and
mTOR
was
the
main
idea
behind
the
development
of
new
targeted
agents
in
advanced
RCC
.

Since

,
3
targeted
agents
have
been
approved
by

Food
and
Drug
Administration
(
FDA
)
for
the
treatment
of
advanced
RCC
:
sorafenib
,
sunitinib
and
temsirolimus
.

Sorafenib
and
sunitinib
are
synthetic
,
orally
active
agents
shown
to
directly
inhibit
vascular
endothelial
growth
factor
receptors
-2
and
-3
(
VEGFR-2
,
VEGFR-3
)
and
platelet-derived
growth
factor
receptor
beta
(
PDGFR-beta
)
,
while
temsirolimus
is
an
mTOR
inhibitor
.

Recent
clinical
studies
form
the
basis
for
new
guidelines
for
the
treatment
of
advanced
RCC
:
sorafenib
should
be
used
as
a
second-line
treatment
,
sunitinib
as
the
first-line
therapy
for
good
and
intermediate-risk
patients
,
and
temsirolimus
should
be
considered
as
first-line
treatment
for
poor-risk
patients
.

Future
approaches
to
targeted
therapy
should
focus
on
optimizing
the
use
of
current
active
drugs
,
exploring
their
combinations
or
investigating
their
sequential
use
.

In
addition
,
it
is
important
to
define
the
mechanisms
of
resistance
on
their
use
and
to
further
investigate
biomarkers
and
enhance
treatment
efficacy
for
the
individual
patients
.

The
development
of
these
targeted
therapies
represents
an
exciting
step
forward
in
the
treatment
of
advanced
RCC
.

Protein

Here
we

that
were
originally
developed
for
RNA
delivery
as
vaccine
delivery
vehicles

Micellar

were
assembled
from
amphiphilic

composed
of
an
ampholytic
core-forming
block
and
a
redesigned
polycationic
corona
block
doped
with

Polymers

with
simultaneous
packaging
of

and
a

.

Conjugation
of

significantly
enhanced
antigen
cross-presentation
in

relative
to
free
ova
or
an
unconjugated
,
physical

of
the

.

Subcutaneous

elicited
a

.

Significantly
,
immunization
with

further
augmented

This

demonstrates
the
ability

to
actively
promote

Inflammatory
bowel
disease
(
IBD
)
is
a
chronic
inflammatory
disorder
in
the
intestine
which
involves
overproduction
of
pro-inflammatory
cytokines
and
excessive
functions
of
inflammatory
cells
.

However
,
current
treatments
for
IBD
may
have
potential
adverse
effects
including
steroid
dependence
,
infections
and
lymphoma
.

Therefore
new
therapies
or
drug
candidates
for
the
treatment
of
IBD
are
desperately
needed
.

In
the
present
study
we
found
that
icariin
,
a
major
bioactive
compound
from
plants
in
Epimedium
family
,
exerted
protective
effect
on
intestinal
inflammation
in
mice
induced
by
dextran
sulfate
sodium
.

Oral
administration
of
icariin
significantly
attenuated
the
disease
progression
and
alleviated
the
pathological
changes
of
colitis
.

It
also
inhibited
the
production
of
pro-inflammatory
cytokines
and
expression
of
p-p65
,
p-STAT1
and
p-STAT3
in
colon
tissues
.

Further
study
showed
that
icariin
dose-dependently
inhibited
the
proliferation
and
activation
of
T
lymphocytes
,
and
suppressed
pro-inflammatory
cytokine
levels
of
activated
T
cells
.

Moreover
,
icariin
treatment
inhibited
the
phosphorylations
of
STAT1
and
STAT3
in
CD4

T
cells
,
which

The
data
that
have
accumulated
in
recent
years
underscore
the
importance
of
carefully
weighing
the
risks
and
benefits
of
traditional
NSAIDs
and
COX-2
selective
inhibitors
before
making
therapeutic
decisions
for
the
management
of
chronic
arthritis
.

In
clinical
practice
,
the
majority
of
patients
with
moderate
to
severe
arthritis
who
might
benefit
from
NSAID
or
COX-2
therapy
are
likely
to
be
elderly
and
,
therefore
,
at
higher
risk
for
gastrointestinal
and
cardiovascular
adverse
events
than
younger
persons
.

Thus
,
these
patients
are
more
likely
to
be
taking
low-dose
aspirin
and
using
over-the-counter
NSAIDs
for
pain
.

Selecting
a
combination
of
therapies
that
provides
relief
from
arthritis-related
symptoms
,
minimizes
cardiovascular
risk
,
and
preserves
the
gastrointestinal
mucosa
is
complex
.

Factors
to
consider
include
the
interference
of
certain
NSAIDs
,
such
as
ibuprofen
or
naproxen
,
with
the
antiplatelet
effects
of
aspirin;
direct
effects
of
non-selective
NSAIDs
and
of
COX-2
selective
inhibitors
on
fluid
retention
and
blood
pressure;
emerging
data
about
cardiovascular
risks
associated
with
these
drugs;
differences
between
these
agents
with
regard
to
associated
gastrointestinal
adverse
event
rates;
and
the
feasibility
of
coadministration
of
anti-inflammatory
therapies
with
gastro-protective
agents

Peptidergic

-prazosin
binds
to
alpha

adrenoceptors
on
these
cells
and
is
displaceable
by
unlabelled
prazosin
in
concentrations
up
to
10
(
-7
)
M
.

However
,
at
greater
concentrations
of
prazosin
,
there
is
a
paradoxical
accumulation
of
[
(
3
)
H
]
-prazosin
which
we
have
attributed
to
Transport-P
.

Uptake
of
prazosin
via
Transport-P
is
detectable
at
10
(
-10
)
M
prazosin
concentration
,
is
linear
up
to
10

M
and
at
greater
concentrations
becomes
non-linear
.

In
contrast
,
in
noradrenergic
neurones
,
noradrenaline
uptake
is
linear
and
saturates
above
10
(
-7

M
.

In
noradrenergic
neurones
and
in
non-neuronal
cells
,
there
is
no
uptake
of
prazosin
in
concentrations
up
to
10

M
,
suggesting
that
Transport-P
is
a
specialised
function
of
peptidergic
neurones
.

Using
a

peptidergic
(
gonadotrophin-releasing

line
which
possesses
Transport-P
,
we
have
studied
the
interaction
of
alpha
(
1
)
adrenoceptors
with
Transport-P
.

Polymerase
chain
reactions
and
DNA
sequencing
of
the
products
demonstrated
that
only
the
alpha
(
1B

sub-type
of
adrenoceptors
is
present
in
GnRH
cells
.

In

and
in

MF-2
cells
which
express
native
alpha
(
1B

adrenoceptors
,
[
(

H

-prazosin
was
displaced
by
unlabelled

in
a
normal

process
,
with
no

In

,
[
(

-prazosin
was
displaced
likewise
by
a

)
adrenergic
agonists
,
none
of
which
increased
the
binding
of
[
(

H

-prazosin
.

Hence
,
the
prazosin
paradox
is
not
due
to
some
function
of
alpha
(
1
)
adrenoceptors
,
such
as
internalization
of
ligand-receptor
complexes
.

In
neurones
which

transfection
with

cDNA
resulted
in
over-expression
of
alpha
(
1B

adrenoceptors
,
but
the
prazosin
paradox
was
unaltered
.

Thus
,
alpha
(

adrenoceptors
and
Transport-P
mediate
distinct
functions
in
peptidergic

,
but
the
mechanism
of
pathogenesis
of
the
encephalopathy
,
spastic
paraparesis
and

remains
undetermined
.

HHH
syndrome
was
diagnosed
in
a
2-year-old
Palestinian
boy
with
developmental
delay
and
seizures
,
and
subsequently
in
his
13-year-old
brother
with
developmental
delay
.

Direct
sequencing
of
the
PCR
products
of
SLC25A15
exon
amplifications
revealed
that
both
brothers
were
homozygous
for
a
novel
446G
deletion
in
exon

as
well
as
for
a
760A>T
(

in

,
which
is
downstream
of
a
premature

produced
by
the
frameshift
resulting
from
the

had
elevated

an
elevated

,
and
increased
urinary
excretion
of

.

These
findings
are
indicative
of
mitochondrial

and
are
in

with
ultrastructural
studies
showing
increased
numbers
of
large
and
bizarre
mitochondria
in

of
some
HHH

.

Neurologic
and
hepatic
manifestations
are
characteristic

Secondary

may
contribute

the

Understanding
the
molecular
evolution
of
genes
that
underlie
intraspecific
polymorphisms
can
provide
insights
into
the
process
of
adaptive
evolution
.

For
adaptive
polymorphisms
characterized
by
gene
presence
/
absence
(
P
/
A
)
variation
,
underlying
loci
commonly
show
signatures
of
long-term
balancing
selection
,
with
gene-presence
and
gene-absence
alleles
maintained
as
two
divergent
lineages
.

We
examined
the
molecular
evolution
of
two
unlinked
P
/
A
polymorphisms
that
underlie
a
well-documented
adaptive
polymorphism
for
cyanogenesis
(
hydrogen
cyanide
release
with
tissue
damage
)
in
white
clover
.

Both
cyanogenic
and
acyanogenic
plants
occur
in
this
species
,
and
the
ecological
forces
that
maintain
this
chemical
defence
polymorphism
have
been
studied
for
several
decades
.

Using
a
sample
of
65
plants
,
we
investigated
the
molecular
evolution
of
sequences
flanking
the
two
underlying
cyanogenesis
genes
:
Ac
/
ac
(
controlling
the
presence
/
absence
of
cyanogenic
glucosides
)
and
Li
/
li
(
controlling
the
presence
/
absence
of
their
hydrolysing
enzyme
,
linamarase
)
.

A
combination
of
genome
walking
,
PCR
assays
,
DNA
sequence
analysis
and
Southern
blotting
was
used
to
test
whether
these
adaptive
P
/
A
polymorphisms
show
evidence
of
long-term
balancing
selection
,
or
whether
gene-absence
alleles
have
evolved
repeatedly
through
independent
deletion
events
.

For
both
loci
,
we
detect
no
signatures
of
balancing
selection
in
the
closest
flanking
genomic
sequences
.

Instead
,
we
find
evidence
for
variation
in
the
size
of
the
deletions
characterizing
gene-absence
alleles
.

These
observations
strongly
suggest
that
both
of
these
polymorphisms
have
been
evolving
through
recurrent
gene
deletions
over
time
.

We
discuss
the
genetic
mechanisms
that
could
account
for
this
surprising
pattern
and
the
implications
of
these
findings
for
mechanisms
of
rapid
adaptive
evolution
in
white
clover
.
Many
cyanobacterial
species
can
produce
cyanotoxins
,
among
which
mycrocistins
(
MC
)
are
a
group
of
≈100
congeners
of
hepatotoxic
cyclic
heptapeptides
.

MC-RR
differs
from
MC-LR
,
the
most
studied
congener
only
for
one
residue
(
arginine
vs
leucine
)
,
resulting
in
a
ten-fold
difference
in
the
acute
toxicity
in
mice
.

Although
humans
may
be
exposed
to
MC
through
several
routes
and
kinetics
appeared
to
be
the
major
factor
affecting
congener-specific
toxicity
,
little
is
known
on
MC
metabolism
.

The
accepted
pathway
for
MC
detoxication
is
GSH
conjugation
:
here
the
MC-RR
conjugation
with
GSH
catalyzed
by
5
recombinant
human
GSTs
and
human
liver
cytosol
(
HLC
)
has
been
characterized
and
appeared
to
be
more
efficient
than
MC-LR
conjugation
.

The
catalytic

score
is

.

In
HLC
the
spontaneous
reaction
is
favored
vs
the
enzymatic
one
(
ratio

)
at
physiological
GSH
content
.

However
,
at

MC-RR
concentrations
,
representative
of
repeated
oral
exposure
,
and
low

(
down
to
0

05mM
)
,
possibly
associated
to
exposure
to
drugs
or
in
patients
affected
by
several
pathologies
,
the
relevance
of
the
enzymatic
reaction
progressively
increases
,
providing
the
predominant
contribution
to
MC-RR
detoxication
.
We
previously
isolated
a
mutant
which
showed
a
high
tolerance
to
freezing
that
correlated
with
higher
levels
of
intracellular
L-proline
derived
from
L-proline
analogue-resistant
mutants
.

The
mutation
responsible
for
the
analogue
resistance
and
L-proline
accumulation
was
a
single
nuclear
dominant
mutation
.

By
introducing
the
mutant-derived
genomic
library
into
a
non-L-proline-utilizing
strain
,
the
mutant
was
found
to
carry
an
allele
of
the
wild-type
PRO1
gene
encoding
gamma-glutamyl
kinase
,
which
resulted
in
a
single
amino
acid
replacement;
Asp
(
GAC
)
at
position
154
was
replaced
by
Asn
(
AAC
)
.

Interestingly
,
the
allele
of
PRO1
was
shown
to
enhance
the
activities
of
gamma-glutamyl
kinase
and
gamma-glutamyl
phosphate
reductase
,
both
of
which
catalyze
the
first
two
steps
of
L-proline
synthesis
from
L-glutamate
and
which
together
may
form
a
complex
in
vivo
.

When
cultured
in
liquid
minimal
medium
,
yeast
cells
expressing
the
mutated
gamma-glutamyl
kinase
were
found
to
accumulate
intracellular
L-proline
and
showed
a
prominent
increase
in
cell
viability
after
freezing
at
-20
degrees
C
compared
to
the
viability
of
cells
harboring
the
wild-type
PRO1
gene
.

These
results
suggest
that
the
altered
gamma-glutamyl
kinase
results
in
stabilization
of
the
complex
or
has
an
indirect
effect
on
gamma-glutamyl
phosphate
reductase
activity
,
which
leads
to
an
increase
in
L-proline
production
in
Saccharomyces
cerevisiae
.

The
approach
described
in
this
paper
could
be
a
practical
method
for
breeding
novel
freeze-tolerant
yeast
strains

The

.

Targeting

Imatinib
is
a
small-molecule
tyrosine
kinase
inhibitor
of
the
ABL
fusion
gene
,
platelet

growth

receptors
(
PDGFR
)
and
KIT
.

This
agent
has
demonstrated
considerable
activity
in
chronic
myeloid
leukaemia
(
CML
)
by
inhibiting
the
BCR-ABL
fusion
protein
and
gastrointestinal
stromal
tumours
(
GISTs
)
,
which
are
predominantly
driven
by
activating
mutations
in
KIT
.

A
number
of
other
rare
conditions
are
also
responsive
,
for
example
,
dermatofibrosarcoma
protuberans
,
which
is
driven
by
a
chromosomal
translocation
involving
PDGF-B
and
Col1A1
,
resulting
in
overexpression
of
PDGF-B
,
and
hypereosinophillic
syndrome
,
which
can
be
caused
by
activating
PDGFR
mutations
.

The
pivotal
registration
study
for
newly
diagnosed
CML
was
a
large
randomised
trial
comparing
400
mg
/
day
of
imatinib
to
a
combination
of
IFN-alpha
and
cytarabine
,
which
demonstrated
a
significantly
higher
complete
haematological
and
cytogenetic
response
rate
in
the
imatinib
arm
.

In
the
case
of
GIST
a
randomised
study
in
patients
with
inoperable
or
metastatic
disease
explored
doses
of
400
-
600mg
and
reported
a
response
rate
of
>
50%
in
each
arm
plus
disease
stabilisation
and
an
improvement
in
performance
status
.

Large
randomised
trials
have
subsequently
been
performed
,
comparing
400
with
800mg
/
day
.

The
first
to
report
indicates
that
the
larger
dose
is
associated
with
improved
progression-free
survival
,
although
it
is
not
yet
known
whether
or
not
this
will
translate
into
a
difference
in
overall
survival
.

The
most
common
KIT
mutation
involves
exon
11
and
is
associated
with
a
statistically
significant
better
response
and
prognosis
compared
with
other
mutations
or
no
detectable
mutations
.

Mutational
analysis
is
likely
to
become
increasingly
important
in
the
selection
of
patients
for
neoadjuvant
and
adjuvant
treatment

in

Normal
growth
and
function
of
the

are
contingent
on
the
reduction
of
testosterone
to
dihydrotestosterone
(
DHT
)
by
5-alpha
reductase
(
5-AR
)
enzymes
types
1
and
2
.

It
has
been
theorized
that
an
overabundance
of
DHT
may
be
implicated
in
the
pathogenesis
of
both
benign
prostatic
hyperplasia
(
BPH
)
and
prostate
cancer
.

Inhibitors
of
5-AR
such
as
dutasteride
and
finasteride
may
therefore
have
an
important
role
in
the
prevention
and
treatment
of
BPH
and
prostate
cancer
.

Dutasteride
provides
greater
suppression
of
DHT
than
finasteride
,
thereby
underlying
the
hypothesis
that
inhibition
of
both
type
1
and
type
2
would
provide
correspondingly
greater
protection
than
inhibition
of
type
2
alone

on
the

,
Zohar

hypothesized
that
the

was
implicated
in
this

We
hypothesized
that
sumatriptan
,
a

)
agonist
,
would
diminish
5-HT
release
,
thereby
worsening
OCD
symptoms
.

We
further
hypothesized
that
by
beginning
to
desensitize
5-HT
(
1D
)
receptors
,
sumatriptan
pretreatment
would
promote
a
faster
response
or
an
increased
likelihood
of

to
subsequent
treatment
with
a

.

RESULTS
:

CONCLUSIONS
:
Longer
term
studies
of
the
effects
of

on

are
indicated
.

,
may
be

We
cloned

expressed
human
pyridoxal-5\'-phosphate

PLP
)
phosphatase
,
the
coenzymatically
active
form
of
vitamin
B6
,
in
Escherichia

.

Monoclonal
antibodies
(
mAb
)
were
generated
against
purified
human
brain
PLP
phosphatase
in
mice
,
and
four
antibodies
recognizing
different
epitopes
were
obtained
,
one
of
which
inhibited
PLP
phosphatase
.

The
binding
affinities
of
these
four
mAbs
to
PLP
phosphatase
,
as
determined
using
biosensor
technology
,
showed
that
they
had
similar
binding
affinities
.

Using
the
anti-PLP
phosphatase
antibodies
as
probes
,
we
investigated
their
cross-reactivities
in
various
mammalian
and
human
tissues
and
cell
lines
.

The
immunoreactive
bands
obtained
on
Western
blots
had
molecular

kDa
.

Similarly
fractionated
extracts
of
several
mammalian

lines
all
produced
a
single

.

We
believe
that
these
PLP

could
be
used
as
valuable
immunodiagnostic
reagents
for
the
detection

The
aim
of
this

to
find
out
whether
HBV
or
its
components
[

(
HBsAg
)
,
HBV

,
and

]
could
interfere

.

The
full
HBV
genome
or
individual
HBV

)
was
introduced
into
HepG2
cells
to
examine
the
effect
on
host
genomic

,
DNA

efficacy
in
response
to

,
and
DNA

.

Responses
to
apoptosis

in
the
HBV
ORF-transfected
HepG2
cells
were
also
compared
with
those
in
HBV-positive
and
HBV-negative
human
hepatocellular
carcinoma
(
HCC
)
cells
.

In
the
absence
of
HBV
replication
,
accumulation
of
HBsAg
in
liver
cells
without
other
HBV
proteins
enhanced
DNA
repair
protein
and
tumor
suppressor
promyelocytic
leukemia
(
PML
)
degradation
,
which
resulted
in
resistance
to
apoptosis
induction
and
deficient
double-strand
DNA
repair
.

However
,
HBsAg-positive
cells
exhibited
increased
cell
death
with
exposure
to
the
poly
(
ADP-ribose
)
polymerase
inhibitor
that
blocks
single-strand
DNA
repair
.

These
results
indicate
that
suppression
of
PML
by
HBsAg
disrupts
cellular
mechanisms
that
respond
to
double-strand
DNA
damage
for
DNA
repair
or
apoptosis
induction
,
which
may
facilitate

Background
:
The
toxicity
related
to
thiopurine
drug
therapy
for
inflammatory

)
varies
widely
among
patients
.

Almost
15-30%
of
patients
with
IBD
develop
side
effects
during
treatment
,
often
bone

Several
factors
have
been
implicated
in
determining
this
toxicity
,
mainly
individual
genetic
variation
related
to
formation
of
active
thiopurine
metabolites
.

The
aim
was
to
identify
genes
involved
in
thiopurine-related
myelosuppression
.

Materials

Results
:
Several

Elastin-like
polypeptides
(
ELPs
)
are
protein
polymers
that
reversibly
phase
separate
in
response
to
increased
temperature
,
pressure
,
concentration
,
ionic
strength
,
and
molecular
weight
.

If
it
were
possible
to
engineer
their
phase
separation
to
respond
to
specific
molecular
substrates
,
ELP
fusion
proteins
might
be
engineered
as
biosensors
,
smart
biomaterials
,
diagnostic
imaging
agents
,
and
targeted
therapies
.

What
has
been
lacking
is
a
strategy
to
design
ELPs
to
respond
to
specific
substrates
.

To
address
this
deficiency
,
we
report
that
ELP
fusion
proteins
phase
separate
in
response
to
chemical
inducers
of
dimerization
(
CID
)
.

The
rationale
is
that
ELP
phase
separation
depends
on
molecular
weight
,
concentration
,
and
local
hydrophobicity;
therefore
,
processes
that
affect
these
properties
,
including
noncovalent
dimerization
,
can
be
tuned
to
produce
isothermal
phase
separation
.

To
test
this
hypothesis
,
constructs
were
evaluated
consisting
of
an
immunophilin
:
human
FK-506
binding
protein
12
(
FKBP
)
attached
to
an
ELP
.

Under
stoichiometric
binding
of
a
CID
,
the
fusion
protein
homodimerizes
and
triggers
phase
separation
.

This
dimerization
is
reversible
upon
saturation
with
excess
CID
or
competitive
binding
of
a
small
lipophilic
macrolide
to
FKBP
.

By
modulating
the
ELP
molecular
weight
,
phase
separation
was
tuned
for
isothermal
response
to
CID
at
physiological
ionic
strength
and
temperature
(
37
°C
)
.

To
interpret
the
relationship
between
transition
temperature
and
equilibrium
binding
constants
,
an
empirical
mathematical
model
was
employed
.

To
the
best
of
our
knowledge
,
this
report
is
the
first
demonstration
of
reversible
ELP
switching
in
response
to
controlled
dimerization
.

Due
to
its
simplicity
,
this
strategy
may
be
useful
to
design
ELP
fusion
proteins
that
respond
to
specific
dimeric
biological
entities
.
Human
UDP-glucuronosyltransferase
(
UGT
)
1A1
catalyzes
the
metabolism
of
numerous
clinically
and
pharmacologically
important
compounds
such
as
bilirubin
and
SN-38
.

UGT1A1
is
predominantly
expressed
in
the
liver
and
intestine
,
but
not
in
the
kidney
.

The
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
uncover
the
mechanism
of
the
tissue-specific
expression
of
UGT1A1
,
focusing
on
its
epigenetic
regulation
.

Bisulfite
sequence
analysis
revealed
that
the
CpG-rich
region
near
the
UGT1A1
promoter
(
-85
to
+
40
)
was
hypermethylated
(
83%
)
in
the
kidney
,
whereas
it
was
hypomethylated
(
37%
)
in
the
liver
.

A
chromatin
immunoprecipitation
assay
demonstrated
that
histone
H3
near
the
promoter
was
hypoacetylated
in
the
kidney
but
was
hyperacetylated
in
the
liver;
this
hyperacetylation
was
accompanied
by
the
recruitment
of
HNF1α
to
the
promoter
.

The
UGT1A1
promoter
in
human
kidney-derived
HK-2
cells
that
do
not
express
UGT1A1
was
fully
methylated
,
but
was
relatively
unmethylated
in
human
liver-derived
HuH-7
cells
that
express
UGT1A1
.

Treatment
with
5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine
(
5-Aza-dC
)
,
an
inhibitor
of
DNA
methylation
,
resulted
in
an
increase
of
UGT1A1
mRNA
expression
in
both
cell
types
,
but
the
increase
was
much
larger
in
HK-2
cells
than
in
HuH-7
cells
.

The
transfection
of
an
HNF1α
expression
plasmid
into
the
HK-2
cells
resulted
in
an
increase
of
UGT1A1
mRNA
only
in
the
presence
of
5-Aza-dC
.

In
summary
,
we
found
that
DNA
hypermethylation
along
with
histone
hypoacetylation
interferes
with
the
binding
of
HNF1α
,
resulting
in
the
defective
expression
of
UGT1A1
in
the
human
kidney
.

Thus
,
epigenetic
regulation
is
a
crucial
determinant
of
tissue-specific
expression
of
UGT1A1
.

Silicon
(
Si

has
been
considered
a
very
promising
anode
material
for

due
to
its
high

However
,
high-capacity

usually
suffer
from
low
electronic
conductivity
,
large
volume
change
,
and
severe
aggregation
problems
during

In
this

,
a

nanostructured
anode
with
Si

and
wrapped
by
graphene
is
synthesized
by
a
one-step

The
functional

(
50-100
nm
)
not
only
react
with
graphene
oxide
and
bind
Si
nanoparticles
to
the
graphene
oxide
shell
,
but
also
prevent
Si
nanoparticles
from
aggregation
,
thus
contributing
to
a
uniform
Si
suspension
.

A
homogeneous
graphene-encapsulated
Si
nanoparticle
morphology
forms
during
the
aerosol
spraying
process
.

The
open-ended
graphene
shell
with

lithiation
/
delithiation
,
and
the
void
space
inside
the
graphene
shell
accompanied
by
its
strong
mechanical
strength
can
effectively
accommodate
the
volume
expansion
of
Si
upon
lithiation
.

The
graphene
shell
provides
good
electronic
conductivity
for
Si
nanoparticles
and
prevents
them
from
aggregating
during
charge

discharge
cycles
.

Since

these

Testosterone
has
been
shown
to
suppress
the
acute
stress-induced
activation
of
the
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
axis;
however
,
the
mechanisms
underlying
this
response
remain
unclear
.

The
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
axis
is
regulated
by
a
neuroendocrine
subpopulation
of
medial
parvocellular
neurons
in
the
paraventricular
nucleus
of
the
hypothalamus
(
PVN
)
.

These
neurons
are
devoid
of
androgen
receptors
(
ARs
)
.

Therefore
,
a
possibility
is
that
the
PVN
target
neurons
respond
to
a
metabolite
in
the
testosterone
catabolic
pathway
via
an
AR-independent
mechanism
.

The
dihydrotestosterone
metabolite
,
5α-androstane-3β
,
17β-diol
(
3β-diol
)
,
binds
and
activates
estrogen
receptor-β
(
ER-β
)
,
the
predominant
ER
in
the
PVN
.

In
the
PVN
,
ER-β
is
coexpressed
with
oxytocin
(
OT
)
.

Therefore
,
we
tested
the
hypothesis
that
3β-diol
regulates
OT
expression
through
ER-β
activation
.

Treatment
of
ovariectomized
rats
with
estradiol
benzoate
or
3β-diol
for
4
days
increased
OT
mRNA
selectively
in
the
midcaudal
,
but
not
rostral
PVN
compared
with
vehicle-treated
controls
.

3β-Diol
treatment
also
increased
OT
mRNA
in
the
hypothalamic
N38
cell
line
in
vitro
.

The
functional
interactions
between
3β-diol
and
ER-β
with
the
human
OT
promoter
were
examined
using
an
OT
promoter-luciferase
reporter
construct
(
OT-luc
)
.

In
a
dose-dependent
manner
,
3β-diol
treatment
increased
OT-luc
activity
when
cells
were
cotransfected
with
ER-β
,
but
not
ER-α
.

The
3β-diol-induced
OT-luc
activity
was
reduced
by
deletion
of
the
promoter
region
containing
the
composite
hormone
response
element
(
cHRE
)
.

Point
mutations
of
the
cHRE
also
prevented
OT-luc
activation
by
3β-diol
.

These
results
indicate
that
3β-diol
induces
OT
promoter
activity
via
ER-β-cHRE
interactions
.

Polymerases
belonging
to
the
DinB
class
of
the
Y-family
translesion
synthesis
DNA
polymerases
have
a
preference
for
accurately
and
efficiently
bypassing
damaged
guanosines
.

These
DinB
polymerases
also
generate
single-base
(
-1
)
deletions
at
high
frequencies
with
most
occurring
on
repetitive
'deletion
hotspot'
sequences
.

Human
DNA
polymerase
kappa
(
hPolκ
)
,
the
eukaryotic
DinB
homologue
,
displays
an
unusual
efficiency
for
to
extend
from
mispaired
primer
termini
,
either
by
extending
directly
from
the
mispair
or
by
primer-template
misalignment
.

This
latter
property
explains
how
hPolκ
creates
single-base
deletions
in
non-repetitive
sequences
,
but
does
not
address
how
deletions
occur
in
repetitive
deletion
hotspots
.

Here
,
we
show
that
hPolκ
uses
a
classical
Streisinger
template-slippage
mechanism
to
generate
-1
deletions
in
repetitive
sequences
,
as
do
the
bacterial
and
archaeal
homologues
.

After
the
first
nucleotide
is
added
by
template
slippage
,
however
,
hPolκ
can
efficiently
realign
the
primer-template
duplex
before
continuing
DNA
synthesis
.

Strand
realignment
results
in
a
base-substitution
mutation
,
minimizing
generation
of
more
deleterious
frameshift
mutations
.

On
non-repetitive
sequences
,
we
find
that
nucleotide
misincorporation
is
slower
if
the
incoming
nucleotide
can
correctly
basepair
with
the
nucleotide
immediately
5'
to
the
templating
base
,
thereby
competing
against
the
mispairing
with
the
templating
base
.

An
increasing
body
of
evidence
has
linked
AMP-activated
protein
kinase
(
AMPK
)
and
malonyl
coenzyme
A
(
CoA
)
to
the
regulation
of
energy
balance
.

Thus
,
factors
that
activate
AMPK
and
decrease
the
concentration
of
malonyl
CoA
in
peripheral
tissues
,
such
as
exercise
,
decrease
triglyceride
accumulation
in
the
adipocyte
and
other
cells
.

The
data
reviewed
here
suggest
that
this
is
related
to
the
fact
that
these
factors
concurrently
increase
fatty
acid
oxidation
,
decrease
the
esterification
of
fatty
acids
to
form
glycerolipids
,
and
,
by
mechanisms
still
unknown
,
increase
energy
expenditure
.

Malonyl
CoA
contributes
to
these
events
because
it
is
an
allosteric
inhibitor
of
carnitine
palmitoyltransferase
,
the
enzyme
that
controls
the
transfer
of
long-chain
fatty
acyl
CoA
from
the
cytosol
to
the
mitochondria
,
where
they
are
oxidized
.

AMPK
activation
in
turn
increases
fatty
acid
oxidation
(
by
effects
on
enzymes
that
govern
malonyl
CoA
synthesis
and
possibly
its
degradation
)
and
inhibits
triglyceride
synthesis
.

It
also
increases
the
expression
of
uncoupling
proteins
and
the
transcriptional
regulator
peroxisome
proliferator-activated
receptor
gamma
coactivator-1alpha
(
PGC1alpha
)
,
which
could
possibly
increase
energy
expenditure
.

Recent
studies
suggest
that
the
ability
of
leptin
,
adiponectin
,
5'-aminoimidazole
4-carboxamide
riboside
(
AICAR
)
,
adrenergic
agonists
,
and
metformin
to
diminish
adiposity
may
be
mediated
,
at
least
in
part
,
by
AMPK
activation
in
peripheral
tissues
.

In
addition
,
preliminary
studies
suggest
that
malonyl
CoA
and
AMPK
take
part
in
fuel-sensing
and
signaling
mechanisms
in
the
hypothalamus
that
could
regulate
food
intake

expenditure

The

targeting

of

largely
from
the

clearance

Adapalene
is
a
novel
chemical
entity
which
,
in
terms
of
pharmacology
,
behaves
similar
to
tretinoin
,
but
is
chemically
and
photochemically
stable
.

It
has
a
particular
selectivity
profile
for
the
known
nuclear
retinoic
acid
receptors
with
low
affinity
for
RAR
alpha
and
no
transactivating
potential
for
RXR
alpha
.

This
receptor
profile
could
imply
that
adapalene
,
in
contrast
to
tretinoin
,
affects
the
terminal
differentiation
pathway
of
epidermal
cells
rather
than
their
proliferation
.

Furthermore
,
adapalene
does
not
bind
to
members
of
the
cellular
retinoic
acid
binding
protein
family
.

Adapalene
has
comedolytic
activity
in

mouse
model
.

It
exerts
a
moderate-to-potent
anti-inflammatory
effect
in

In

the
efficacy
of
adapalene
was
comparable

if
not
superior
,

adapalene
was
better
tolerated
.

The
data
reviewed
in
this
paper
indicate
that
adapalene
should
be
particularly
beneficial

the
treatment
of
acne

Neonatal
epileptic

mutations
in
the
PNPO
gene
encoding

)
ine
5'-phosphate
oxidase
.
In
this
study
,
we
utilized
a
genetic
approach
to
identify
genes
which
render
yeast
cells
resistant
to
cerulenin
(
Cer
)
,
a
potent
and
noncompetitive
inhibitor
of
fatty
acid
synthase
(
FAS
)
.

Overexpression
of
the
yeast
transcription
factor
Yap1p
was
found
to
confer
Cer
resistance
(
CerR
)
.

This
resistance
was
shown
to
be
less
pronounced
in
a
strain
deleted
for
YCF1
,
a
multidrug
resistance
ABC
transporter
,
supporting
previous
observations
that
implicated
YCF1
in
mediating
CerR
.

However
,
isolation
of
YAP1
as
a
high-copy
CerR
gene
in
a
ycf1delta
strain
suggested
that
YAP1-induced
CerR
was
mediated
by
additional
downstream
effectors
.

Overexpression
of
neither
glutathione
reductase
nor
a
predicted
aryl
alcohol
dehydrogenase
(
the
products
of
two
YAP1-regulated
genes
involved
in
detoxification
)
conferred
CerR
.

Overexpression
of
ATR1
,
another
YAP1-regulated
gene
previously
implicated
in
conferring
resistance
to
a
number
of
cytotoxic
drugs
,
was
also
incapable
of
making
cells
resistant
to
Cer
.

In
contrast
,
overexpression
of
Flr1p
,
a
yeast
transporter
of
the
major
facilitator
superfamily
which
is
also
under
the
control
of
YAP1
,
was
sufficient
to
confer
CerR
in
an
otherwise
wild-type
background
.

Moreover
,
CerR
was
markedly
diminished
in
a
strain
deleted
for
FLR1
.

These
findings
implicate
members
of
both
of
the
transporter
superfamilies
involved
in
multiple
drug
resistance
(
MDR
)
in
the
acquisition
of
CerR

,

studies
indicate
that

may
be

which

It
was
more
frequently
seen
in

related
disorders
,
with
mitochondrial
DNA
depletion
or
deletion
,
but
not
in
patients
with

complex

.

Besides
,
it
was
a
consistent
feature
of

mutations
in
TAZ
,
SERAC1
,
OPA3
,
DNAJC19
and
TMEM70
accounting
for

.

3-methylglutaconic
aciduria
is
found
quite
frequently
in
patients
suspected
of
a
metabolic
disorder
,
and
mitochondrial
dysfunction
is
indeed
a
common

.

It
is
only
a
discriminative
feature
of
patients
with
mutations
in
AUH
,
TAZ
,
SERAC1
,

These
conditions
should
therefore
be
referred
to
as
inborn
errors
of
metabolism
with
3-methylglutaconic

as
discriminative

An
enzymatic
method
for
determining
L-malic
acid
in
wine
based
on
an
L-malate
sensing
layer
with
nicotinamide
adenine
dinucleotide
(
NAD

)
,
L-malate
dehydrogenase
(
L-MDH
)
and
diaphorase
(
DI
)
,
immobilized
by
sol-gel
technology
,
was
constructed
and
evaluated
.

The
sol-gel
glass
was
prepared
with
tetramethoxysilane
(
TMOS
)
,
water
and
HCl
.

L-MDH
catalyzes
the
reaction
between
L-malate
and
NAD
+
,
producing
NADH
,
whose
fluorescence
(
lambdaexc
=
340
nm
,
lambdaem
=
430
nm
)
could
be
directly
related
to
the
amount
of
L-malate
.

NADH
is
converted
to
NAD
+
by
applying
hexacyanoferrate
(
III
)
as
oxidant
in
the
presence
of
DI
.

Some
parameters
affecting
sol-gel
encapsulation
and
the
pH
of
the
enzymatic
reaction
were
studied
.

It
exhibits

and
allows

The
content
of
L-malic
acid
was
determined
for
different
types
of
wine
,
and
polyvinylpolypyrrolidone
(

was
used
as
a

The
results
obtained
for
the

The

,
is
the
pore-forming

specific
to
the

.

These
are
implicated
in
fast
excitatory
and

Spinocerebellar
ataxia
type
6
(
SCA
6
)
is
an
autosomal
dominant
cerebellar
degeneration
that
shares
neuropathological
findings
with
late-onset
cortical
cerebellar
atrophy
(
CCA
)
.

It
is
caused
by
an
abnormal
expansion
of
a
trinucleotide
(
CAG
)
repeat
in
exon
47
of
CACNA1A
,
on
chromosome
19p13
.

This
translates
into
a
polyglutamine
(
polyQ
)
tract
of
prolonged
length
in
the
carboxyl
terminal
of
the
alpha1A
subunit
.

Heterologous
expression
of
mutated
alpha1A
subunits
results
in
increased
channel
inactivation
in
electrophysiological
tests
.

No
treatment
is
known
to
improve
SCA
6
at
present
,
as
none
of
the
available
drugs
is
able
to
reverse
alpha1A
dysregulation
,
nor
disturbed
protein
aggregation

transport
and
localization
in
this

.

The
drugs
gabapentin
and
pregabalin
interact
with
the

Gabapentin
and
pregabalin
slow
the
rate
of
inactivation
in
recombinant

Xenopus
oocytes
.

These
drugs
improve
ataxia
in
cases
of
CCA
,
olivopontocerebellar
atrophy
and
ataxia-telangiectasia
.

On
the
basis
of
the
neuropathological
identity
of
SCA
6
with
CCA
,
and
given
the
capacity
of
gabapentin
and
pregabalin
to
decrease
P
/
Q-type
VDCCs
inactivation
,
in
this
paper
the
authors
put
forward
the
hypothesis
that
the
administration
of
gabapentin
and
pregabalin
might
prove
beneficial
in
SCA
6
as
the
ataxia
caused
by
this
disease
would
be
expected
to
improve
.

The
authors
hope
that
researchers
working
with
this
illness
will
be
inspired
and
encouraged
to
undertake
the
appropriate
clinical
and
experimental
work

Human
CYP3A
is
the
most
abundant
P450
isozyme
present
in
the
human
liver
and
small
intestine
,
and
metabolizes
around
50%
of
medical
drugs
on
the
market
.

The
human
CYP3A
subfamily
comprises
four
members
(
CYP3A4
,
CYP3A5
,
CYP3A7
,
CYP3A43
)
encoded
on
human
chromosome
7
.

However
,
transgenic
mouse
lines
carrying
the
entire
human
CYP3A
cluster
have
not
been
constructed
because
of
limitations
in
conventional
cloning
techniques
.

Here
,
we
show
that
the
introduction
of
a
human
artificial
chromosome
(
HAC
)
containing
the
entire
genomic
human
CYP3A
locus
recapitulates
tissue-
and
stage-specific
expression
of
human
CYP3A
genes
and
xenobiotic
metabolism
in
mice
.

About
700
kb
of
the
entire
CYP3A
genomic
segment
was
cloned
into
a
HAC
(
CYP3A-HAC
)
,
and
trans-chromosomic
(
Tc
)
mice
carrying
a
single
copy
of
germline-transmittable
CYP3A-HAC
were
generated
via
a
chromosome-engineering
technique
.

The
tissue-
and
stage-specific
expression
profiles
of
CYP3A
genes
were
consistent
with
those
seen
in
humans
.

We
further
generated
mice
carrying
the
CYP3A-HAC
in
the
background
homozygous
for
targeted
deletion
of
most
endogenous
Cyp3a
genes
.

In
this
mouse
strain
with
'fully
humanized'
CYP3A
genes
,
the
kinetics
of
triazolam
metabolism
,
CYP3A-mediated
mechanism-based
inactivation
effects
and
formation
of
fetal-specific
metabolites
of
dehydroepiandrosterone
observed
in
humans
were
well
reproduced
.

Thus
,
these
mice
are
likely
to
be
valuable
in
evaluating
novel
drugs
metabolized
by
CYP3A
enzymes
and
in
studying
the
regulation
of
human
CYP3A
gene
expression
.

Furthermore
,
this
system
can
also
be
used
for
generating
Tc
mice
carrying
other
human
metabolic
genes
.
Manganese-containing
fungicides
like
Mancozeb
have
been
associated
with
neurodegenerative
conditions
like
Parkinson's
disease
.

We
examined
the
behavioral
damage
and
differential
neuronal
vulnerability
resulting
from
Mancozeb
exposure
using
Caenorhabditis
elegans
,
an
important
mid-trophic
level
soil
organism
that
is
also
a
powerful
model
for
studying
mechanisms
of
environmental
pollutant-induced
neurodegenerative
disease
.

The
dopamine-mediated
swim
to
crawl
locomotory
transition
behavior
is
exquisitely
vulnerable
to
Mancozeb
,
with
functional
impairment
preceding
markers
of
neuronal
structural
damage
.

The
damage
is
partially
rescued
in
mutants
lacking
the
divalent
metal
transporter
,
SMF-1
,
demonstrating
that
some
,
but
not
all
,
of
the
damage
is
mediated
by
manganese
.

Increasing
concentrations
of
Mancozeb
recruit
additional
behavioral
dysfunction
,
notably
serotonin-mediated
egg-laying
behavior
,
but
without
evident
serotonergic
neuronal
structural
damage
.

Thus
,
measurements
of
behavioral
dysfunction
are
a
sensitive
early
marker
of
fungicide
toxicity
that
could
be
exploited
to
examine
further
mechanisms
of
neuron
damage
and
possible
therapeutic
interventions
.

These
results
also
provide
important
insight
into
the
consequences
of
fungicide
use
on
the
ecological
behavior
of
nematodes

to
which
non-ATP

The
in

Advancements

to
intently
focus
on
development
of
target-based
approaches
rather
than

.

From
among
the
various

identified

validated
and
inhibited
at
different
hallmarks
of
cancer
,
protein

(
PTKs

most
.

Insulin
receptors
(

)
,
insulin
like
growth
factor
receptors
(
IGF-1R
)
and
their
hybrid
receptors
belong
to
tyrosine
kinase
receptor
(
TKR
)
family
,
constitute
a
structural
homology
among
them
and
generate
a
growth
promoting
IGF
system
on
binding
with
either
insulin
,
IGF-1
or
IGF-2
.

The
system
induces
the
mitogenic
effects
through
a
torrent
of
cell
signals
produced
as
a
result
of
cross
talk
with
other
growth
promoting
peptides
and
steroidal
hormones
,
ultimately
resulting
in
hijacking
apoptosis
and
increasing
cell
proliferation
and
cell
survival
in
cancer
cells
.

Various
strategies
such
as
anti-IGF-1R
antibodies
,

mimetic
peptides
,

,

of

IGF-1R
signaling
.

However
,
targeting
IGF-1R
with
small
molecules
has
gained
considerable
attention
in

Warfarin
is
the
most
widely
prescribed
oral
anticoagulant
,
but
there
is
greater
than
10-fold
interindividual
variability
in
the
dose
required
to
attain
a
therapeutic
response
.

Information
from
pharmacogenomics
,
the
study
of
the
interaction
of
an
individual's
genotype
and
drug
response
,
can
help
optimize
drug
efficacy
while
minimizing
adverse
drug
reactions
.

Pharmacogenetic

the
warfarin
metabolic
enzyme
CYP2C9
and
warfarin
target
enzyme
,
vitamin
K
epoxide

,
confirmed
their
influence
on
warfarin
maintenance
dose
.

Possession
of
CYP2C9*2
or
CYP2C9*3
variant
alleles
,
which
result
in
decreased
enzyme
activity
,
is
associated
with
a
significant
decrease
in
the
mean
warfarin
dose
.

Several
single
nucleotide
polymorphisms
(
SNPs
)
in
VKORC1
are
associated
with
warfarin
dose
across
the
normal
dose
range
.

Haplotypes
based
on
these
SNPs
explain
a
large
fraction
of
the
interindividual
variation
in
warfarin
dose
,
and
VKORC1
has
an
approximately
three-fold
greater
effect
than
CYP2C9
.

Algorithms
incorporating
genetic
(
CYP2C9
and
VKORC1
)
,
demographic
,
and
clinical
factors
to
estimate
the
warfarin
dosage
,
could
potentially
minimize
the
risk
of
over

The
mechanisms
leading
to
airway
hyper-responsiveness
(
AHR
)
in
asthma
are
still
not
fully
understood
.

AHR
could
be
produced
by
hypersensitivity
of
the
airway
smooth
muscle
or
hyperreactivity
of
the
airways
.

This
study
was
conducted
to
ascertain
whether
AHR
in
a
murine
model
of
asthma
is
produced
by
changes
at
the
level
of
the
airway
smooth
muscle
.

Airway
smooth
muscle
responses
were
characterised
in
vitro
in
isolated
trachea
spirals
from
naive
mice
and
from
an
acute
ovalbumin
(
OVA
)
challenge
model
of
allergic
asthma
.

AHR
was
investigated
in
vivo
in
conscious
,
freely
moving
mice
.

Inflammatory
cell
influx
into
the
lungs
and
antibody
responses
to
the
antigen
were
also
measured
.

In
vitro
study
of
tracheal
airway
smooth
muscle
from
naive
mice
demonstrated
concentration-related
contractions
to
methacholine
and
5-HT
,
but
no
responses
to
histamine
or
adenosine
or
its
stable
analogue
,
5'-N-ethyl-carboxamidoadenosine
.

The
contractions
to
5-HT
were
inhibited
by
ketanserin
and
alosetron
indicating
involvement
of
5-HT
(
2A
)
and
5-HT
(
3
)
receptors
,
respectively
.

In
an
acute
model
of
allergic
asthma
,
OVA-treated
mice
were
shown
to
be
atopic
by
inflammatory
cell
influx
to
the
lungs
after
OVA
challenge
,
increases
in
total
IgE
and
OVA-specific
IgG
levels
and
contractions
to
OVA
in
isolated
trachea
.

In
the
asthmatic
model
,
AHR
to
methacholine
was
demonstrated
in
conscious
,
freely
moving
mice
in
vivo
and
in
isolated
trachea
in
vitro
24
and
72h
after
OVA
challenge
.

No
AHR
in
vitro
was
seen
for
5-HT
,
histamine
or
adenosine
.

These
results
suggest
that
,
in
our
mouse
model
of
asthma
,
changes
occur
at
the
level
of
the
muscarinic
receptor
transduction
pathway
of
coupling
to
airway
smooth
muscle
contraction
.

These
changes
are
maintained
when
tissues
are
removed
from
the
inflammatory
environment
and
for
at
least
3
days
.
The
intrinsic
sympathomimetic
activity
(
ISA
)
of
a
beta-adrenoceptor
blocker
can
be
mediated
by
beta
(
1
)
-
or
beta
(
2
)
-adrenoceptors
.

The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
characterize
the
ISA
of
the
beta-adrenoceptor
blocker
carteolol
in
healthy
volunteers
.

Two
approaches
were
employed
.

First
,
we
assessed
the
effects
of
carteolol
(
20
,
40
or
80
mg
p
.

o
.

)
on
blood
pressure
,
heart
rate
and
heart-rate
corrected
duration
of
electromechanical
systole
(
QS
(

)
c
,
a
measure
of
cardiac
contractility
)
in
the
volunteers
.

Carteolol
dose-dependently
increased
systolic
blood
pressure
,
heart
rate
and
contractility
and
decreased
diastolic
blood
pressure
.

The
beta
(
1
)
-adrenoceptor
blocker
bisoprolol
did
not
attenuate
these
carteolol
effects
,
but
rather
enhanced
the
effects
on
heart
rate
and
systolic
blood
pressure
.

Second
,
we
treated
volunteers
for
7
days
with
1
x
20
mg
/
day
carteolol
and
assessed
lymphocyte
beta
(
2
)
-adrenoceptor
density
(
by

[

]
-iodocyanopindolol
binding
)
and
functional
responsiveness
(
by
10
muM
isoprenaline-induced
increase
in
lymphocyte
cyclic
AMP
content
)
.

Carteolol
significantly
reduced
lymphocyte
beta
(
2
)
-adrenoceptor
density
and
function
.

After
withdrawal
of
carteolol
lymphocyte
beta
(
2
)
-adrenoceptor
density
and
function
recovered
only
very
slowly
and
had
not
returned
to
control
levels
11
days
after
carteolol
withdrawal
.

In
conclusion
,
the
fact
that
,
on
the
one
hand
,
the
cardiovascular
effects
of
carteolol
were
not
attenuated
by
the
beta
(
1
)
-adrenoceptor
blocker
bisoprolol
and
,
on
the
other
,
carteolol
significantly
decreased
lymphocyte
beta
(
2
)
-adrenoceptor
density
and
function
is
in
favour
of
the
idea
that
the
ISA
of
carteolol
is
mediated
by
beta

2
)
-adrenoceptors
.

The

(

was
used
to
test
this

The

Familial
hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy
(
FHC
)
is
a
major
cause
of
sudden
cardiac
death
in
young
athletes
.

The
discovery
in
1990
that
a
point
mutation
at
residue
403
(
R403Q
)
in
the
β-myosin
heavy
chain
(
MHC
)
caused
a
severe
form
of
FHC
was
the
first
of
many
demonstrations
linking
FHC
to
mutations
in
muscle
proteins
.

A
mouse
model
for
FHC
has
been
widely
used
to
study
the
mechanochemical
properties
of
mutated
cardiac
myosin
,
but
mouse
hearts
express
α-MHC
,
whereas
the
ventricles
of
larger
mammals
express
predominantly
β-MHC
.

To
address
the
role
of
the
isoform
backbone
on
function
,
we
generated
a
transgenic
mouse
in
which
the
endogenous
α-MHC
was
partially
replaced
with
transgenically
encoded
β-MHC
or
α-MHC
.

A
His-tag
was
cloned
at
the
N-terminus
,
along
with
R403Q
,
to
facilitate
isolation
of
myosin
subfragment-1
(
S1
)
.

Stopped-flow
kinetics
were
used
to
measure
the
equilibrium
constants
and
rates
of
nucleotide
binding
and
release
for
the
mouse
S1
isoforms
bound
to
actin
.

For
the
wildtype
isoforms
,
we
found
that
the
affinity
of
MgADP
for
α-S1
(
100
μM
)
is
~
4-fold
weaker
than
for
β-S1
(
25
μM
)
.

Correspondingly
,
the
MgADP
release
rate
for
α-S1
(
350
s-1
)
is
~
3-fold
greater
than
for
β-S1
(
120
s-1
)
.

Introducing
the
R403Q
mutation
caused
only
a
minor
reduction
in
kinetics
for
β-S1
,
but
R403Q
in
α-S1
caused
the
ADP
release
rate
to
increase
by
20%
(
430
s-1
)
.

These
transient
kinetic
studies
on
mouse
cardiac
myosins
provide
strong
evidence
that
the
functional
impact
of
an
FHC
mutation
on
myosin
depends
on
the
isoform
backbone
.
OBJECTIVE
:
Leukotriene
antagonists
are
increasingly
used
in
asthma
management
.

Pranlukast
is
a
new
,

.

The
present
clinical
trial
was
performed
to
study
the
effect
and
safety
of
pranlukast
in
mild-to-moderate
asthma
.

METHODOLOGY
:
A
randomized
,
double-blind
,
placebo-controlled
,
parallel
group
study
was
performed
in
eight
medical
centres
in
Korea
.

Mild-to-moderate
asthma
patients
who
had
been
treated
with
beta2-agonists
and
/
or
inhaled
corticosteroids
were
studied
.

The
patients'
symptoms
were
evaluated
by
asthma
diary
and
twice-daily
peak
flow
monitoring
.

RESULTS
:
Of
the
206
patients
enrolled
,
197
were
eligible
for
analysis
.

The
pranlukast
group
(
n

showed
statistically
significant
improvement
in
asthma
symptoms
,
including
asthma
attack
rate
,
daily
living
score
,
and
morning
and
evening
asthma

.

Pranlukast
significantly
reduced
the
consumption
of

placebo
group
,
forced

)
and
forced

not
significantly
higher
in
the
pranlukast
group
.

Morning
and
evening
peak

were
significantly
increased
after

treatment
at
weeks

CONCLUSIONS
:
These
results
suggest
a
beta
(
1
)
-adrenoceptor-dependent
hepatic
up-regulation
of
HO-1
and
a
better
maintained
hepatocellular
function
after
hemorrhagic
shock
in
animals
pretreated
with
dobutamine
.

The
improved
hepatocellular
function
may
be
in
part
mediated
by
carbon
monoxide
because
of
up-regulation
of
HO-1
.

Pretreatment
with

might
be
a
potential
means
of

Fatty

body
metabolism
differ
considerably
between

ruminant
species
.

The
regulation
of
the
key
enzymes
involved
may
differ
accordingly
.

Carnitine
palmitoyltransferase
1
(
CPT
1
)
is
the
key
locus
for
the
control
of
long-chain
fatty
acid
beta-oxidation
and
liver
ketogenesis
.

Previously
we
showed
that
CPT
1
kinetics
in
sheep
and
rat
liver
mitochondria
differ
.

We
cloned
cDNAs
for
both
isoforms
[
liver-
(
L-
)
and
muscle-
(
M-
)
]
of
ovine
CPT
1
in
order
to
elucidate
the
structural
features
of
these
proteins
and
their
genes
(
CPT1A
and
CPT1B
)
.

Their
deduced
amino
acid
sequences
show
a
high
degree
of
conservation
compared
with
orthologues
from
other
mammalian
species
,
with
the
notable
exception
of
the
N-terminus
of
ovine
M-CPT
1
.

These
differences
were
also
present
in
bovine
M-CPT
1
,
whose
N-terminal
sequence
we
determined
.

In
addition
,
the
5'-end
of
the
sheep
CPT1B
cDNA
suggested
a
different
promoter
architecture
when
compared
with
previously
characterized
CPT1B
genes
.

Northern
blotting
revealed
differences
in
tissue
distribution
for
both
CPT1A
and
CPT1B
transcripts
compared
with
other
species
.

In
particular
,
ovine
CPT1B
mRNA
was
less
tissue
restricted
,
and
the
predominant
transcript
in
the
pancreas
was
CPT1B
.

Expression
in
yeast
allowed
kinetic
characterization
of
the
two

enzymes
,
and
of
a

which
the
distinctive
N-terminal
segment
of
ovine
M-CPT
1
was
replaced
with
that
from
rat
M-CPT
1
.

The
ovine
N-terminal
segment
influences
the
kinetics
of
the
enzyme
for
both
its
substrates
,
such
that
the
K
(
m
)
for
palmitoyl-CoA
is
decreased
and
that
for
carnitine
is
increased
for
the
chimaera
,

Using
AG490
,
previously
shown

inhibit

pathway
,
we
therefore
investigated
the
central

of
these
two

pathways
in
mediating
sickness
behavior
,
fever
and
accompanying
brain
inflammation
induced

.

The

was
not
altered
and
AG490
did
not
have
any
effect
on
rats
receiving

(

)
.

We
did
observe
effects
of
AG490
on
STAT3-signaling
at
4
h
,
while
AG490-mediated
changes
in
brain
activity
of
inflammatory
transcription
factors
at
8
h
were
not
significant
.

Increased
NF-IL6
and
suppressor

cytokines
3
mRNA-expression
in
AG490
/
LPS-treated
rats
were
indicative
of
a
compensative
activation
at
24
h
.

Moreover
,
a
significant
decrease
in
hypothalamic
anti-inflammatory
IL-10-expression
and
an
increase
in
inflammatory
microsomal
prostaglandin
E
synthase
(
mPGES
)
mRNA-expression
8
h
after
LPS-injection
was
revealed
in
AG490
pre-treated
animals
compared
to
solvent-treated
LPS-controls
.

In
summary
,
we
have
shown
a
dissociation
between
the
effects
of
central
AG490
treatment
on
fever
and
components
of
sickness
behavior
,
which
appears
to
be
related
to
reduced
IL-10
and
increased
mPGES-expression
in
the
brain
.

Thus
,
AG490
might
have
therapeutic
potential
to
reduce
sickness
behavior
.

High
activity
of
5alpha-reductase
enzyme
in
humans
results
in
excessive
dihydrotestosterone
levels
in
peripheral
tissues
and
hence
suppression
of
androgen
action
by
5alpha-reductase
inhibitors
is
a
logical
treatment
for
BPH
as
they
inhibit
the
conversion
of
testosterone
to
dihydrotestosterone
.

.

In
human
it
decreases
the
prostatic

level
by
70-90%
and
reduces
the
prostatic
size
.

Dutasteride
(

)
another
related
analogue
has
been
approved
in
2002

Unlike
Finasteride
,
Dutasteride

inhibitor
of

5alpha-reductase
type
I
and
type

A
number
of
classes
of
non-steroidal
inhibitors
of

have
also
been
synthesized
generally
by
removing
one
or
more
rings
from
the
azasteroidal
structure
or
by
an
early
non-steroidal

Compensatory
renal
hypertrophy
following
reduction
in
renal
mass
leads
to
a
hypermetabolic
state
and
increases
in
basal
mitochondrial
oxidative
stress
and
susceptibility
to
several
nephrotoxicants
.

Previous
studies
provide
conflicting
data
on
whether
renal
mitochondria
after
reduction
in
renal
mass
undergo
proliferation
or
hypertrophy
or
both
.

In
the
present
study
,
our
goal
was
to
determine
whether
mitochondria
of
hypertrophied
kidney
undergo
hypertrophy
or
proliferation
after
uninephrectomy
using
the
uninephrectomized
(
NPX
)
rat
model
.

Renal
proximal
tubular

PT
)
cells
from
NPX
rats
exhibited
increased
mitochondrial
density
,
membrane
potential
and
protein
but
no
significant
difference
in
mitochondrial
DNA
,
as
compared
to
PT
cells
from
control
rats
.

Our
previous
studies
showed
that
overexpression
of
two
mitochondrial
anion
transporters
,
the
dicarboxylate
(
DIC
,
Slc25a10
)
and
oxoglutarate
(
OGC
,
Slc25a11
)
carriers
,
in
NRK-52E
cells
resulted
in
increased
mitochondrial
uptake
of
glutathione
(
GSH
)
and
protection
from
chemically
induced
apoptosis
.

In
the
present
study
,
we
overexpressed
DIC-
and
OGC-cDNA
plasmids
to
assess
their
function
in
renal
PT
cells
after
compensatory
renal
hypertrophy
.

PT
cells
from
NPX
rats
that
were
first
preincubated
with
GSH
were
protected
from
cytotoxicity
due
to
the
mitochondrial
inhibitor
antimycin
A
by
overexpression
of
either
of
the
two
mitochondrial
GSH
transporters
.

Our
present
results
provide
further
evidence
that
compensatory
renal
hypertrophy
is
associated
primarily
with
mitochondrial
hypertrophy
and
hyperpolarization
and
that
manipulation
of
mitochondrial
GSH
transporters
in
PT
cells
of
hypertrophied
kidney
can
alter
susceptibility
to
chemically
induced
injury
under
appropriate
conditions
and
may
be
a
suitable
therapeutic
approach

Growth

We
have
previously
shown
that
women
with
congenital
isolated
GH
deficiency
(
IGHD
)
caused
by
a
homozygous
mutation
in
the
GHRH
receptor
gene
(
GHRHR
)
(
MUT
/
MUT
)
have
a
short
reproductive
life
,
with
anticipated
climacteric
.

At
climacteric
,
they
have
lower
prolactin
levels
than
normal
controls
(
N
/
N
)
.

Because
they
are
able
to
breast
feed
,
we
hypothesized
that
this
prolactin
reduction
is
limited
to
climacteric
,
as
result
of
lower
estradiol
exposure
of
the
lactotrophs
.

The
purposes
of
this
work
were
to
assess
prolactin
levels
in
broader
age
adults
homozygous
and
heterozygous
(
MUT

N
)
for
the
mutation
and
in
normal

(

and
to
correlate
them
to

levels

We
enrolled

Anthropometric

,
and

were
measured
.

Free
testosterone
was
calculated
.

Prolactin
levels
were
similar
in
the
three
groups
.

In
males
,
testosterone
and
SHBG
levels
were
higher
in
MUT
/
MUT
in
comparison
to
N
/
N
.

There
was
no
difference
in

among
groups
.

In

individuals
,
prolactin
correlated
inversely
with

(

<
0
.

)
and
directly
with
serum
estradiol
(
p

)
.

Prolactin
levels
in
subjects
with
IGHD
due
to
a
homozygous
GHRHR
mutation
are
similar
to
heterozygous
and
normal
homozygous
,
but
total
testosterone
and
SHBG
are
higher
in
male
MUT

MUT
,
with
no
difference
in

testosterone
.

The
reduced
prolactin
level
is
limited
to

possibly
due
to
reduced

In
vivo
microdialysis
in
conscious
rats
was
used
to
examine
the
effect
of
clozapine
on
serotonin
(
5-hydroxytryptamine
,
5-HT
)
efflux
in
the
prefrontal
cortex
and
dorsal
raphe
nucleus
and
dopamine
efflux
in
the
prefrontal
cortex
.

Both
systemic
and
local
administration
of
clozapine
(
systemic
,
10
or
20
mg

,
i
.

p

;
local
,

)
increased
5-HT
efflux
in
the
dorsal
raphe
.

However
,
in
the
prefrontal
cortex
,
dialysate
5-HT
increased
when
clozapine
(
100
microM
)
was
administered
through
the
probe
,
while
no
effect
was
observed
when
it
was
administered
systemically
.

By
pretreatment
with
the
selective
5-HT1A
receptor
antagonist
p-MPPI
(
3
mg

p
.

)
,
systemic
treatment
of
clozapine
(
10
mg
/
kg
,
i
.

p
.

)
significantly
increased
5-HT
efflux
in
the
prefrontal
cortex
.

This
result
suggests
that
the
ability
of
clozapine
to
enhance
the
extracellular
concentrations
of
5-HT
in
the
dorsal
raphe
attenuates
this
drug's
effect
in
the
frontal
cortex
,
probably
through
the
stimulation
of
5-HT1A
somatodendritic
autoreceptors
in
the
dorsal
raphe
.

We
also
found
that
pretreatment
with
p-MPPI
(
3
mg
/
kg
,
i
.

p
.

)
attenuated
by
45%
the
rise
in
cortical
dopamine
levels
induced
by
clozapine
(
10
mg
/
kg
,
i
.

p
.

)
.

These
findings
imply
that
the
reduction
in
serotonergic
input
from
the
dorsal
raphe
nucleus
induced
by
clozapine
could
lead
to
an
increase
in
dopamine
release
in
the
prefrontal

The

Physostigmine

In

In

BACKGROUND
AND
PURPOSE
:
There
are
two
important
properties
of
receptor-ligand
interactions
:
affinity
(
the
ability
of
the
ligand
to
bind
to
the
receptor
)
and
efficacy
(
the
ability
of
the
receptor-ligand
complex
to
induce
a
response
)
.

Ligands
are
classified
as
agonists
or
antagonists
depending
on
whether
or
not
they
have
efficacy
.

In
theory
,
it
is
possible
to
develop
selective
agonists
based
on
selective
affinity
,
selective
intrinsic
efficacy
or
both
.

This
study
examined
the
affinity
and
intrinsic
efficacy
of
31
beta-adrenoceptor
agonists
at
the
three
human
beta-adrenoceptors
to
determine
whether
the
current
agonists
are
subtype
selective
because
of
affinity
or
intrinsic
efficacy
.

EXPERIMENTAL
APPROACH
:
Stable
clonal
CHO-K1
cell
lines
,
transfected
with
either
the
human
beta

KEY
RESULTS
:
Several

found
to
be
highly

of

,
while

had
little
affinity-selectivity
.

However
,
the
intrinsic
efficacy
of
salmeterol
,
formoterol
and
isoprenaline
was
similar
across
all
three
receptor
subtypes
.

Other
ligands

;
clenbuterol

,
salbutamol
for

)
)
were
found
to
have
subtype-selective
intrinsic
efficacy
.

Several
ligands
appeared
to
activate
two
agonist
conformations
of
the
beta
(
1

-
and
beta
(
3
)
-adrenoceptors
.

CONCLUSIONS
AND
IMPLICATIONS
:
There
are
agonists
with
subtype
selectivity
based
upon
both
selective
affinity
and
selective
intrinsic
efficacy
.

Therefore
,
there
is
scope
to
develop
better
selective
agonists
based
upon
both
selective
affinity
and

The
carboxylic
acid
NSAID
fenclozic
acid
exhibited
an
excellent
preclinical
safety
profile
and
promising
clinical
efficacy
,
yet
was
withdrawn
from
clinical
development
in
1971
due
to
hepatotoxicity
observed
in
clinical
trials
.

A
variety
of
modern
in
vitro
approaches
have
been
used
to
explore
potential
underlying
mechanisms
.

Covalent
binding
studies
were
undertaken
with
[
(

)
C
]
-fenclozic
acid
to
investigate
the
possible
role
of
reactive
metabolites
.

Time-dependent
covalent
binding
to
protein
was
observed
in
NADPH-supplemented
liver
microsomes
,
although
no
metabolites
were
detected
in
these
incubations
or
in
reactive
metabolite
trapping
experiments
.

In
human
hepatocytes
,
covalent
binding
was
observed
at
lower
levels
than
in
microsomes
and
a
minor
uncharacterizable
metabolite
was
also
observed
.

In
addition
,
covalent
binding
was
observed
in
incubations
undertaken
with
dog
and
rat
hepatocytes
,
where
a
taurine
conjugate
of
the
drug
was
detected
.

Although
an
acyl
glucuronide
metabolite
was
detected
when
liver
microsomes
from
human
,
rat
and
dog
were
supplemented
with
UDPGA
,
there
was
no
detectable
UDPGA-dependent
covalent
binding
.

No
effects
were
observed
when
fenclozic
acid
was
assessed
for
P450-dependent
and
P450-independent
cytotoxicity
to
THLE
cell

,
time-dependent

,
inhibition
of
the
biliary
efflux

BSEP
and
MRP2
or

.

These
data
suggest
that
Phase
1
bioactivation
plays
a
role
in
the
hepatotoxicity
of
fenclozic
acid
and
highlight
the
unique
insight
into
mechanisms
of
human
drug
toxicity
that
can
be
provided
by
investigations
of
biotransformation
and
covalent
binding
to

AIMS
:
Sedation
induced
by
antihistamines
is
widely
recognized
to
be
caused
by
their
penetration
through
the
blood-brain-barrier
and
the
consequent
occupation
of
brain
histamine
H1-receptors
.

We
previously
studied
the
mechanism
of
sedation
caused
by
antihistamines
using
positron
emission
tomography
(
PET
)
.

Recently
,
we
revealed
the
nonsedative
characteristic
of
ebastine
,
a
second-generation
antihistamine
,
with
cognitive
performance
tests
.

In
the
present
study
,
H1-receptor
occupation
by
ebastine
was
examined
in
the
human
brain
using
PET
.

METHODS
:
Ebastine
10
mg
and
(
+
)
-chlorpheniramine
2
or
6
mg
were
orally
given
to
healthy
male
volunteers
.

PET
scans
with
[
11C
]
-doxepin
,
a
potent
H1-receptor
antagonist
,
were
conducted
near
tmax
of
respective
drugs
.

Other
volunteers
in
the
control
group
also
received
PET
scans
.

The
binding
potential
of
doxepin
(
BP
=
Bmax
/
Kd
)
for
available
brain
H1-receptors
was
imaged
on
a
voxel-by-voxel
basis
through
graphical
analysis
.

By
setting
regions
of
interest
,
the
H1-receptor
occupancy
of
drugs
was
calculated
in
several
H1-receptor
rich
regions
.

RESULTS
:
Brain
distribution
of
radioactivity
after
ebastine
treatment
was
similar
to
that
without
any
drugs
.

However
,
after
the
oral
administration
of
2
mg
(
+
)
-chlorpheniramine
,
the
level
was
lower
than
after
ebastine
and
nondrug
treatments
.

Graphical
analysis
followed
by
statistical
parametric
mapping
(
SPM96
)
revealed
that
H1-receptor
rich
regions
such
as
cortices
,
cingulate
gyrus
and
thalamus
were
regions
where
the
BPs
after
ebastine
were
significantly
higher
than
after
(
+
)
-chlorpheniramine
(
2
mg
)
.

H1-receptor
occupancies
in
cortex
were
approximately
10%
by
ebastine
and
>
or
=
50%
by
either
dose
of
(
+
)
-chlorpheniramine
(
95%
confidence
interval
for
difference
in
the
mean
receptor
occupancies
:
27%
,
54%
for
2
mg
and
35%
,
62%
for
6
mg
vs
ebastine
,
respectively
)
.

Receptor
occupancies
increased
with
increasing
plasma
concentration
of
(
+
)
-chlorpheniramine
,
but
not
with
concentration
of
carebastine
,
an
active
metabolite
of
ebastine
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
Ebastine
(
10
mg
orally
)
causes
brain
histamine
H1-receptor
occupation
of
approximately
10%
,
consistent
with
its
lower
incidence
of
sedative
effect
,
whereas
(
+
)
-chlorpheniramine
occupied
about
50%
of
brain
H1-receptors
even
at
a
low
but
sedative
dose
of
2
mg;
occupancy
of
(

)
-chlorpheniramine
was
correlated

Although
it
has
been
reported
that
deficiency
of
toll-like
receptor
4
(
TLR4
)
is
associated
with
reduced
atherosclerosis
in
atherosclerosis-prone
mice
and
attenuated
pro-inflammatory
state
in
diabetic
mice
,
it
remains
undetermined
whether
treatment
with
a
TLR4
antagonist
reduces
atherosclerosis
in
nondiabetic
or
diabetic
mice
that
have
TLR4
expression
.

In
this
study
,
we
determined
the
effect
of
Rhodobacter

(
Rs-LPS
)
,
an
established
TLR4
antagonist
,
on
early-stage
atherosclerosis
in
nondiabetic
and
streptozotocin-induced
diabetic
apolipoprotein

)
mice
.

Analysis
of
atherosclerotic
lesions
of
both
en
face
aortas
and
cross
sections
of
aortic
roots
showed
that
administration
of
Rs-LPS
in
14-week-old
diabetic
Apoe
(
-
/
-
)
mice
for
10
weeks
significantly
reduced
atherosclerotic
lesions
.

Although
atherosclerotic
lesions
in
nondiabetic
Apoe
(
-
/
-
)
mice
appeared
to
be
decreased
by
Rs-LPS
treatment
,
the
difference
was
not
statistically
significant
.

Metabolic
study
showed
that
Rs-LPS
significantly
lowered
serum
levels
of
cholesterol
and
triglycerides
in
nondiabetic
mice
but
not
in
diabetic
mice
.

Furthermore
,
immunohistochemistry
studies
showed
that
Rs-LPS
inhibited
the
expression
of
interleukin
6
and
matrix
metalloproteinase-9
and
reduced
the
content
of
monocytes
and
macrophages
in
atherosclerotic
plaques
.

Taken
together
,
this
study
demonstrated
for
the
first
time
that
TLR4
antagonist
inhibited
vascular
inflammation
and
atherogenesis
in
diabetic

As
this

partially
mimics
some
features
of

(
COPD
)
,
we
have

the

anti-inflammatory
compounds
,
dexamethasone
and
rolipram
and
a
non-specific
matrix

The
compounds
were

(

.

Marimastat

and

(

)
were
able
to
decrease
significantly
neutrophil
recruitment
at
4
and
24
h
after
rhMMP-12
instillation
,
but
only
marimastat
(
30
and
100
mg

)
was
effective
at
decreasing
the
macrophage
recruitment
occurring
at

.

Marimastat
(

,
dexamethasone
(

reduced

levels
in

fluid
.

Similar
results
were
obtained
in
lung
homogenates
except
with
rolipram
.

Dexamethasone
and
rolipram
were
able
to
inhibit
the
early
inflammatory
response
but
were
ineffective
to
limit
the
macrophage
influx
.

In
contrast
,
marimastat
was
able
to
reduce
early
and
late
response
.

These
data
indicate
that
MMP-12
instillation
in
mice
could
highlight
some
of
the
inflammatory
response
seen
in
COPD
and
could
be
used
for
the
pharmacological
evaluation

The
gastric
pathogen
Helicobacter
pylori
produces
large
amounts
of
urease
,
whose
enzyme
activity
enables
the
bacterium
to
survive
in
the
stomach
.

We
have
previously
shown
that
ureases
display
enzyme-independent
effects
in
mammalian
models
,
most
through
lipoxygenases-mediated
pathways
.

Here
,
we
evaluated
potential
pro-inflammatory
properties
of
H
.

pylori
urease
(
HPU
)
.

Mouse
paw
edema
and
activation
of
human
neutrophils
were
tested
using
a
purified
,
cell-free
,
recombinant
HPU
.

rHPU
induced
paw
edema
with
intense
neutrophil
infiltration
.

In
vitro
100
nM
rHPU
was
chemotactic
to
human
neutrophils
,
inducing
production
of
reactive
oxygen
species
.

rHPU-activated
neutrophils
showed
increased
lifespan
,
with
inhibition
of
apoptosis
accompanied
by
alterations
of
Bcl-XL
and
Bad
contents
.

These
effects
of
rHPU
persisted
in
the
absence
of
enzyme
activity
.

rHPU-induced
paw
edema
,
neutrophil
chemotaxis
and
apoptosis
inhibition
reverted
in
the
presence
of
the
lipoxygenase
inhibitors
esculetin
or
AA861
.

Neutrophils
exposed
to
rHPU
showed
increased
content
of
lipoxygenase
(
s
)
and
no
alteration
of
cyclooxygenase
(
s
)
.

Altogether
,
our
data
indicate
that
HPU
,
besides
allowing
the
bacterial
survival
in
the
stomach
,
could
play
an
important
role
in
the
pathogenesis
of
the

The
solution-phase
parallel
synthesis
of
tethered
dimers
was
employed
to
identify
lead
inhibitors
of
bacterial
NAD
synthetase
.

Active
dimers
contained
two
aromatic
end
groups
joined
by
a
polymethylene
linker
,
with
one
end
group
containing
a
permanent
positive
charge
.

Effective
inhibitors
of
NAD
synthetase
also
inhibited
the
growth
of
Gram-positive
(
but
not
Gram-negative
)
bacteria
,
including
antibiotic-resistant
strains
.

The
desmethyl
precursors
of
active
inhibitors
lacked
a
permanent
positive
charge
and
were
inactive
as
either
enzyme
inhibitors
or
antibacterial
agents
.

Similarly
,
a
close
structural
analogue
of
the
most
active
inhibitors
contained
two
additional
ether
oxygens
in
the
tether
and
was
inactive
in
both
assays
.

These
results
are
consistent
with
the
premise
that
NAD
synthetase
inhibition
is
responsible
for
the
antibacterial
actions
and
support
further
studies
on
NAD
synthetase
as
a
new
target
for
antibacterial
agents
.
Female
rats
were
treated
orally
for
13
wk
with
YM022
(
300

.

kg-1
.

day-1
)
and
with
omeprazole
(

)
or
famotidine
(
900
mumol
.

kg-1
.

day-1
)
with
or
without
YM022
.

At
2
h
after
the
last
dose
,
YM022
and
omeprazole
markedly
inhibited
basal
and
pentagastrin-induced
acid
secretion
.

Famotidine
was
less
potent
than
YM022
and
omeprazole
against
both
secretions
.

The
degree
of
increase
in
plasma
gastrin
level
in
the
three
groups
was
parallel
to
the
antisecretory
potencies
of
the
drugs
.

At
14
days
after
the
cessation
of
omeprazole
treatment
,
the
secretory
response
to
pentagastrin
increased
above
that
of
the
control
.

This
hyperresponse
lasted
for
>
or
=
56
days
.

In
the
famotidine-treated
group
,
a
small
increase
in
secretory
response
to
pentagastrin
was
observed
but
was
not
statistically
significant
.

The
increase
in
secretory
response
to
pentagastrin
was
paralleled
by
an
increase
in
mucosal
cell
mass
.

In
contrast
,
YM022
not
only
exhibited
a
long-lasting
inhibition
of
pentagastrin-induced
acid
secretion
but
also
prevented
the
hyperresponse
to
pentagastrin
caused
by
omeprazole
.

These
results
indicate
that
the
hypergastrinemia
caused
by
long-term
administration
of
antisecretory
drugs
increases
mucosal
secretory
response
to
pentagastrin
through
a

such

demonstrate
that
the

Silver
(
Ag
)
NPs
are
highly
relevant
for
human
exposure
due
to
their
use
in
food
contact
materials
,
dietary
supplements
,
and
antibacterial
wound
treatments
.

Due
to
the
large
number
of
different
NPs
already
used
in
various
products
and
being
developed
for
new
applications
,
it
is
essential
that
relevant

and
cheap
methods
of

suitable
for
these

are
established
.

Therefore
,
this
study
used
a
simple
hepatocytes
model
combined
with
an
in

model
to
simulate
the

in
the

following
in

of
female
Wistar

via

to
50
μg
of
NPs
and
in

exposures
using
the
human
hepatocyte
cell
line
C3A
.

We
found
that
Ag

were
highly
cytotoxic
to
hepatocytes

At
sublethal
concentrations
with

,
Ag
NPs
were
detected
in
cytoplasm

of
hepatocytes
.

We
observed
similar
effects
of
Ag

on

This
article
presents
evidence
of
the
potential
toxicity
and
inflammogenic

of
Ag

in
the

In
addition
,
the
similarities
between
in

are
striking
and
encouraging
for

were
measured
by

,
respectively
.

Valdecoxib
,
etoricoxib
,

inhibited
platelet

with
the
following

.

The

compounds
,

had
corresponding

In
conclusion
,
a
second
wave
of
COX-2
inhibitors
with
higher
biochemical

than
the
existing
coxibs
has
been
developed
.

Whether
their
administration
will
be
associated
with
improved
clinical
efficacy

safety
vis-a-vis

remains
to

Owing
to
their
unique
physical
and
chemical
properties
,
graphene
and
its
derivatives
such
as
graphene
oxide
(
GO
)
,
reduced
graphene
oxide
(
RGO
)
and
GO-nanocomposites
have
attracted
tremendous
interest
in
many
different
fields
including
biomedicine
in
recent
years
.

With
every
atom
exposed
on
its
surface
,
single-layered
graphene
shows
ultra-high
surface
area
available
for
efficient
molecular
loading
and
bioconjugation
,
and
has
been
widely
explored
as
novel
nano-carriers
for
drug
and
gene
delivery
.

Utilizing
the
intrinsic
near-infrared
(
NIR
)
optical
absorbance
,
in
vivo
graphene-based
photothermal
therapy
has
been
realized
,
achieving
excellent
anti-tumor
therapeutic
efficacy
in
animal
experiments
.

A
variety
of
inorganic
nanoparticles
can
be
grown
on
the
surface
of
nano-graphene
,
obtaining
functional
graphene-based
nanocomposites
with
interesting
optical
and
magnetic
properties
useful
for
multi-modal
imaging
and
imaging-guided
cancer
therapy
.

Moreover
,
significant
efforts
have
also
been
devoted
to
study
the
behaviors
and
toxicology
of
functionalized
nano-graphene
in
animals
.

It
has
been
uncovered
that
both
surface
chemistry
and
sizes
play
key
roles
in
controlling
the
biodistribution
,
excretion
,
and
toxicity
of
nano-graphene
.

Biocompatibly
coated
nano-graphene
with
ultra-small

can
be
cleared

without
rendering
noticeable
toxicity
to
the
treated
mice
.

In
this
review
article
,
we
will
summarize
the
latest
progress
in
this
rapidly
growing
field
,

discuss
future
prospects
and

Disruption
of
prepulse
inhibition
(
PPI
)
of
acoustic
startle
in
rats
has
been
widely
used
as
an
animal
model
for
the
sensorimotor
gating
deficit
state
usually
found
in
schizophrenia
.

PPI
was
reported
to
be
regulated
by
forebrain
circuits
,
including
mesolimbic
cortex
,
nucleus
accumbens
,
ventral
pallidum
,
thalamus
,
and
pedunculopontine
tegmentum
nucleus
.

Phencyclidine
or
dopamine
agonists
,
which
causes
psychotomimetic
symptoms
in
humans
,
disrupts
PPI
in
animals
.

The
ED50
value
of
the
drugs
to
reverse
the
phencyclidine-induced
PPI
disruption
was
significantly
correlated
with
the
affinity
for
the
serotonin
2A
receptor
,
but
not
for
the
dopamine
D2
receptor
of
each
drug
(
including
atypical
antipsychotics
)
.

In
contrast
,
the
ED50
value
of
the
drugs
to
reverse
the
apomorphine-induced
PPI
disruption
was
significantly
correlated
with
the
affinity
for
the
dopamine
D2
receptor
(
including
typical
antipsychotics
)
.

Thus
the
drug
that
antagonizes
the
disruption
of
PPI
caused
by
PCP
or
DA
agonists
would
be
a
candidate
for
a
therapeutic
agent
for
the
sensorimotor
gating
deficit
state
in
schizophrenic
patients
.

Neural
mechanisms
underlying
the
disruption
of
PPI
were
reviewed
.
Multidrug
resistance
(
MDR
)
has
been
a
major
problem
in
cancer
chemotherapy
.

In
this
study
,
the
aim
was
to
explore
the
reversal
effect
and
its
potential
mechanism
of
rosmarinic
acid
(
RA
)
on
SGC7901
/
Adr
cells
.

3-
(
4
,
5-Dimethylthiazol
)
-2
,
5-diphenyl
tetrazolium
bromide
(
MTT
)
assay
was
used
to
investigate
the
reversal
index
of
RA
in
SGC7901
/
Adr
cell
line
.

The
intracellular
accumulation
of
adriamycin
,
rhodamine123
(
Rh123
)
,
and
the
expression
of
P-glycoprotein
(
P-gp
)
were
assayed
by
flow
cytometry
.

The
influence
of
RA
on
the
transcription
of
MDR1
gene
was
determined
by
reverse
transcription-polymerase
chain
reaction
.

The
results
showed
that
RA
could
reverse
the
MDR
of
SGC7901
/
Adr
cells
,
increase
the
intracellular
accumulation
of
Adr
and
Rh123
,
and
decrease
the
transcription
of
MDR1
gene
and
the
expression
of
P-gp
in
SGC7901
/
Adr
cells
.

These
results
indicated
that
RA
was
a
potential
multidrug
resistance-reversing
agent
and
warranted
further
investigations
.
Gemcitabine
(
dFdC
,
2'
,
2'-difluorodeoxycytidine
)
is
metabolized
by
cytidine
deaminase
(
CDA
)
and
deoxycytidine
kinase
(
DCK
)
,
but
the
contribution
of
genetic
variation
in
these
enzymes
to
the
variability
in
systemic
exposure
and
response
observed
in
cancer
patients
is
unclear
.

Wild-type
enzymes
and
variants
of
CDA
(
Lys27Gln
and
Ala70Thr
)
and
DCK
(
Ile24Val
,
Ala119Gly
,
and
Pro122Ser
)
were
expressed
in
and
purified
from
Escherichia
coli
,
and
enzyme
kinetic
parameters
were
estimated
for
cytarabine
(
Ara-C
)
,
dFdC
,
and
its
metabolite
2'
,
2'-difluorodeoxyuridine
(
dFdU
)
as
substrates
.

All
three
CDA
proteins
showed
similar
K
(
m
)
and
V
(
max
)
for
Ara-C
and
dFdC
deamination
,
except
for
CDA70Thr
,
which
had
a
2
.
5-fold
lower
K
(
m
)
and
6-fold
lower
V
(
max
)
for
Ara-C
deamination
.

All
four
DCK
proteins
yielded
comparable
metabolic
activity
for
Ara-C
and
dFdC
monophosphorylation
,
except
for
DCK24Val
,
which
demonstrated
an
approximately
2-fold
increase
(
P
<
0
.
05
)
in
the
intrinsic
clearance
of
dFdC
monophosphorylation
due
to
a
40%
decrease
in
K
(
m
)
(
P
<
0
.
05
)
.

DCK
did
not
significantly
contribute
to
dFdU
monophosphorylation
.

In
conclusion
,
the
Lys27Gln
substitution
does
not
significantly
modulate
CDA
activity
toward
dFdC
,
and
therefore
would
not
contribute
to
interindividual
variability
in
response
to
gemcitabine
.

The
higher
in
vitro
catalytic
efficiency
of
DCK24Val
toward
dFdC
monophosphorylation
may
be
relevant
to
dFdC
clinical
response
.

The
substrate-dependent
alterations
in
activities
of
CDA70Thr
and
DCK24Val
in
vitro
were
observed
for
the
first
time
,
and
demonstrate
that
the
in
vivo
consequences
of
these
genetic
variations
should
not
be
extrapolated
from
one
substrate
of
these
enzymes
to
another

Endogenous
synthesis
of

has
been
reported
to
increase
in
vitamin

probably
due

,
the
direct
source
of
oxalate
,
to
glycine
.

The
effects
of
vitamin
B6
deficiency
on
hepatic
AGT
isoenzymes
,
designated
AGT
1
and
AGT
2
,
respectively
,
were
examined
with
male
rats;
AGT
1
is
located
both
in
the
peroxisomes
and
in
the
mitochondria
,
and
AGT
2
only
in
the
mitochondria
.

The
holo
activity
of
combined
peroxisomal
and
mitochondrial
AGT
1
with
a
low
Km
for
L-alanine
rapidly
decreased
after
a
lag
time
of
about
2
days
during
feeding
of
the
vitamin
B6-deficient
diet
(
by
50%
in
5
days
,
by
86%
in
14
days
)
.

Peroxisomal
AGT
1
activity
was
more
affected
than
the
mitochondrial
.

The
holo
activity
of
AGT
2
with
a
high
Km
for
L-alanine
decreased
more
slowly
than
AGT
1
(
by
33%
in
14
days
,
by
60%
in
28
days
)
.

Urinary
excretion
of
oxalate
began
to
increase
in
8-9
days
,
when
AGT
2
remained
intact
but
most
of
AGT
1
is
depleted
.

When
the
defect
in
the
glyoxylate
transamination
in
vivo
in
vitamin
B6
deficiency
is
considered
,
these
findings
suggest
that
it
is
due
to
the
deficiency
of
AGT
1
.

The
importance
of
peroxisomal
AGT
1
is
discussed
,
since
peroxisomes
have
been
described
to
be
probably
the
major
site
of
glyoxylate
formation
.
Nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory
drugs
(
NSAIDs
)
are
widely
used
in
clinical
situations
as
anti-inflammatory
,
analgesic
and
antipyretic
drugs
.

However
,
it
is
still
unknown
whether
NSAIDs
have
effects
on
the
development
of
the
central
nervous
system
.

In
the
present
study
,
we
investigated
the
effects
of
NSAIDs
on
neural
stem
cell
(
NSC
)
proliferation
and
differentiation
into
neurons
.

In
contrast
to
aspirin
,
naproxen
,
indomethacin
and
ibuprofen
,
treatment
with
diclofenac
(
10
microM
)
for
2
days
induced
the
death
of
NSCs
in
a
concentration-dependent
manner
.

Diclofenac
also
inhibited
the
proliferation
of
NSCs
and
their
differentiation
into
neurons
.

Treatment
with
diclofenac
resulted
in
nuclear
condensation
(
a
morphological
change
due
to
apoptosis
of
NSCs
)
24hr
after
the
treatment
and
activated
caspase-3
after
6
hr
,
indicating
that
diclofenac
may
cause
apoptosis
of
neuronal
cells
via
activation
of
the
caspase
cascade
.

These
results
suggest
that
diclofenac
may
affect
the
development
of
the
central
nervous
system
.
Within
the
past
decade
,
gonadotrophin-releasing
hormone
(
GnRH
)
agonists
have
contributed
greatly
to
the
success
of
cycles
programmed
for
in-vitro
fertilization
and
embryo
transfer
.

However
,
apart
from
a
preventive
effect
on
the
luteinizing
hormone
(
LH
)
surge
,
most
of
the
beneficial
effects
of
these
molecules
are
still
only
partly
known
.

A
precise
analysis
of
regimens
using
GnRH
agonists
for
ovarian
stimulation
shows
that
many
parameters
may
interfere
with
the
outcome
of
long-term
and
short-term
protocols
.

The
great
variability
between
these
protocols
hampers
our
comprehension
of
the
mechanisms
involved
in
the
overall
clinical
improvement
seen
with
this
therapy
.

The
hypophyseal
desensitization
induced
by
GnRH
agonists
is
greatly
dependent
on
the
dose
and
duration
of
their
administration
,
but
the
residual
gonadotrophin
secretion
is
imperfectly
estimated
by
hormonal
measurements
using
radioimmunometric
assays
.

Moreover
,
the
specific
role
of
GnRH
agonist-induced
ovarian
quiescence
on
subsequent
ovarian
responsiveness
to
gonadotrophins
and
on
endometrial
receptivity
deserves
further
investigation
.

Finally
,
a
direct
ovarian
action
of
GnRH
agonists
on
steroidogenesis
,
folliculogenesis
and
embryo
quality
is
still
controversial
in
humans
.

These
putative
deleterious
effects
of
GnRH
agonists
have
led
some
authors
to
recommend
a
reduction
of
both
dose
and
duration
of
GnRH
agonist
administration
for
women
identified
by
a
poor
response
to
gonadotrophins
.

Using
this
approach
,
a
few
reports
have
recently
shown
some
clinical
advantages
for
ovarian
responsiveness
but
no
convincing
evidence
for
any
improvement
in
pregnancy
rate
.

It
thus
appears
that
the
overall
impact
of
GnRH
agonists
on
reproductive
function
is
still
partly
misunderstood
.
OBJECTIVEMacrovascular
disease
may
contribute
to
increased
risk
of
accelerated
cognitive
decline
in
patients

We
aimed
to
determine
associations
of
measures
of
macrovascular
disease
with
cognitive

in
a
cognitively
healthy
older
population
with

years
)
attended
two

of
the

.

At

.

Seven

of

associated
with
cognitive

in

Further
investigation

The
adenosine
triphosphate-binding
cassette
A1
(
ABCA1
)
gene
plays
a
key
role
in
reverse
cholesterol
transport
.

Some
ABCA1
gene
polymorphisms
have
been
associated
with
high-density
lipoprotein-cholesterol
(
HDL-C
)
concentrations
.

The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
assess
the
effect
of
three
polymorphisms
,
C69T
,
G378C
,
and
G1051A
(
R219K
)
,

cohort
study
.

The
T
allele
of
the
C69T
single
nucleotide
polymorphism
(
SNP
)
was
associated
with
higher
HDL-C
levels
in
normal-weight
men
(
BMI
<25
kg
/
m
(
2
)
)
.

The
C
allele
of
the
G378C
SNP
was
associated
with
lower
HDL-C
in
overweight
subjects
(
BMI
>
or
=
25
kg
/
m
(
2
)
)
.

For
the
G1051A
SNP
,
in
the
normal-weight
group
,
the
minor
A
allele
was
significantly
associated
with
higher
HDL-C
levels
.

In
contrast
,
in
overweight
people
,
the
minor
allele
was
associated
with
lower
HDL-C
levels
.

After
accounting
for
multiple
testing
,
empiric
p
values
remained
significant
for
the
associations
between
G378C
SNP
and
HDL-C
in
the
overweight
group
and
between
G1051A
SNP
and
HDL-C
in
the
normal-weight
group
.

This
study
suggests
that
ABCA1
gene
polymorphisms
modulate
HDL-C
concentrations
,
in
interaction
with
BMI
,
and
,
thus
,
they
might
influence
cardiovascular
risk
in
the
general
population

Thiazolidinediones
(
also
referred
to
as
glitazones
)
,
agonists
for
Peroxisome
Proliferator-Activated
Receptor
gamma
(
PPARγ
)
,
are
used
for
treating
type
2
diabetes
mellitus
,
where
they
decrease
insulin
resistance
and
cardiovascular
risk
.

Compounds
bearing
the
thiazolidinedione
structure
have
also
been
shown
to
inhibit
phosphoinositide
3-kinase
(
PI3K
)
.

Here
we
tried
to
elucidate
the
poorly
defined
role
of
PI3K
/
Akt
in
the
physiology
of
vascular
smooth
muscle
cell
contraction
and
tested
the
hypothesis
that
thiazolidinediones
,
by
affecting
the
PI3K
/
Akt
pathway
,
may
influence
vascular
physiology
.

Isolated
rat
femoral
arteries
segments
were
mounted
in
a
wire
myograph
and
challenged
with
100mM
KCl
or
phenylephrine
(
PE
)
,
in
the
absence
or
presence
of
troglitazone
,
rosiglitazone
,
pioglitazone
,
LY294002
(
PI3K
inhibitor
)
and
10-DEBC
(
Akt
inhibitor
)
.

All
these
compounds
dose-dependently
inhibited
vasoconstriction
to
KCl
or
PE;
their
effect
was
reversible
(
after
60-120
min
washout
)
and
not
affected
by
GW9662
(
a
PPARγ
antagonist
)
or
by
N
(
G
)
-nitro-L-arginine
(
LNNA
,
an
inhibitor
of
NO
biosynthesis
)
.

Analysis
of
phospho-Akt
(
ser
473
)
in
lysates
from
rat
arteries
(
by
immunoblot
)
revealed
that
thiazolidinediones
,
LY294002
and
10-DEBC
,
at
the
same
concentration
and
kinetics
inhibiting
vasoconstriction
,
produced
a
similar
decrease
of
Akt
phosphorylation
.

PI3K
/
Akt
pathway
therefore
appears
to
be
an
important
,
fast
acting
,
modulator
of
contraction
of
vascular
smooth
muscle
.

Thiazolidinediones
decrease
vasoconstriction
of
isolated
vessels
possibly
by
inhibiting
PI3K
/
Akt
pathway
.

Such
an
effect
of
glitazones
,
if
occurring
in
vivo
,
may
impact
cardiovascular
syndromes
related
to
vasospasm
in
diabetic
patients
.
Native

methylmalonate
semialdehyde

was
proteolyzed
by
lysylendopeptidase
C
,
chymotrypsin
,
and
trypsin
to
generate

fragments
of
molecular
masses
:

,

,
55
,
44
,
39
,
53
,
45
,
and
40
kDa
.

A
proteolytic
cleavage
map
of
MMSDH
was
constructed
based
on
sequencing
data
and
a
comparison
of
appearance
and
degradation
rates
of
the
different
protein
fragments
as
shown
by
SDS-PAGE
.

NAD
+
was
highly
effective
as
a
protector
against
proteolysis
in
both
the
N-terminal
and
the
C-terminal
parts
of
the
intact
enzyme
.

NADH
did
not
efficiently
protect
the
intact
enzyme;
however
,
it
stabilized
proteolytic
fragment
L50
from
further
degradation
.

This
suggests
that
the
NAD
(
+
)
-binding
domain
is
not
destroyed
by
cleavage
of
the
N-terminal
part
of
MMSDH
.

CoA
had
no
effect
on
the
proteolytic
cleavage
patterns
of
MMSDH
.

However
,
CoA
esters
reduced
the
protective
effect
of
NAD
+
with
an
order
of
effectiveness
of
acetyl-CoA
greater
than
propionyl-CoA
greater
than
butyryl-CoA
.

p-Nitrophenyl
acetate
,
substrate
for
esterase
activity
by
the
enzyme
,
partially
prevented
the
protective
effect
of
NAD
+
against
proteolysis
.

These
results
suggest
that
S-acylation
of
the
enzyme
prevents
a
stabilizing
conformational
change
induced
in
MMSDH
by
NAD
+
binding
.
Due
to

,
a
state
of
nutritional
inadequacy
often
ensues
,
during
thyrotoxicosis
.

We
aimed
to
investigate
circulating
levels
of
some
major
components
of
the
system
that
regulates
energy
stores
,
glucose
,
and
fat
metabolism
,
during
thyrotoxicosis
compared
to
euthyroidism
.

Fasting
serum
ghrelin
,
leptin
,
adiponectin
,

,
glucagon
,
glucose
,
as
well
as
body

composition
were
analyzed
during
thyrotoxicosis
in
40
hyperthyroid
patients
(

years

)
.

The
same
measurements
were
repeated
an
average
3
months
later
,
when
all
patients
achieved
euthyroidism
.

Compared
to
euthyroidism
,
in
thyrotoxicosis
,
patients
had
lower
ghrelin
and
fat
mass;
had
comparable
insulin
,
HOMA-IR
,
glucagon
,
and
leptin
levels;
higher
levels
of
circulating
adiponectin
.

Fasting
serum
glucose
tended
to
be
higher
during
thyrotoxicosis
.

The
unique
correlation
of
HOMA-IR
was
with
the-glucagon
to
ghrelin
ratio-
(
r
=
0
.
801
,
p
<
0
.
001
)
in
hyperthyrodism
,
and
with
glucagon
itself
in
euthyroidism
(
r
=
-0
.
844
,
p
<
0
.
001
)
.

Circulating
levels
of
ghrelin
are
decreased;
leptin
,
insulin
,
glucagon
are
unchanged;
adiponectin
are
increased
during
hyperthyroidism
.

The
fasting
HOMA-IR
tends
to
be
higher
,
despite
the
decreased
adiposity
in
hyperthyroidism
.

The-glucagon

ghrelin
ratio-strongly
correlates
with
fasting
HOMA-IR
in
hyperthyroidism
.

The
cystic
fibrosis
transmembrane
conductance
regulator
(
CFTR
)
is
an
ion
channel
that
conducts
Cl-
current
.

We
explored
the
CFTR
pore
by
studying
voltage-dependent
blockade
of
the
channel
by
two
organic
anions
:
glibenclamide
and
isethionate
.

To
simplify
the
kinetic
analysis
,
a
CFTR
mutant
,
K1250A-CFTR
,
was
used
because
this
mutant
channel
,
once
opened
,
can
remain
open
for
minutes
.

Dose-response
relationships
of
both
blockers
follow
a
simple
Michaelis-Menten
function
with
K
(
d
)
values
that
differ
by
three
orders
of
magnitude
.

Glibenclamide
blocks
CFTR
from
the
intracellular
side
of
the
membrane
with
slow
kinetics
.

Both
the
on
and
off
rates
of
glibenclamide
block
are
voltage
dependent
.

Removing
external
Cl-
increases
affinity
of
glibenclamide
due
to
a
decrease
of
the
off
rate
and
an
increase
of
the
on
rate
,
suggesting
the
presence
of
a
Cl-
binding
site
external
to
the
glibenclamide
binding
site
.

Isethionate
blocks
the
channel
from
the
cytoplasmic
side
with
fast
kinetics
,
but
has
no
measurable
effect
when
applied
extracellularly
.

Increasing
the
internal
Cl-
concentration
reduces
isethionate
block
without
affecting
its
voltage
dependence
,
suggesting
that
Cl-
and
isethionate
compete
for
a
binding
site
in
the
pore
.

The
voltage
dependence
and
external
Cl-
concentration
dependence
of
isethionate
block
are
nearly
identical
to
those
of
glibenclamide
block
,
suggesting
that
these
two
blockers
may
bind
to
a
common
binding
site
,
an
idea
further
supported
by
kinetic
studies
of
blocking
with
glibenclamide
/
isethionate
mixtures
.

By
comparing
the
physical
and
chemical
natures
of
these
two
blockers
,
we
propose
that
CFTR
channel
has
an
asymmetric
pore
with
a
wide
internal
entrance
and
a
deeply
embedded
blocker
binding
site
where
local
charges
as
well
as
hydrophobic
components
determine
the
affinity
of
the
blockers
.
In
a
previous
study
,
we
showed
that
the
psychoactive
drug
caffeine
alters
the
expression
of
the
dopamine
2
receptor
(
D2R
)
gene
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
.

Here
,
we
report
that
acute
administration
of
antipsychotic
and
anti-parkinsonian
drugs
also
regulate
D2R
gene
expression
in
PC12
cells
and
in
the
mouse
striatum
.

Treatment
of
PC12
cells
with
the
atypical
antipsychotic
and
specific
5-HT
antagonist
clozapine
(
60
microM
)
reduced
D2R
/
luciferase
reporter
expression
by
46%
after
24
h
.

However
,
male
and
female
mice
treated
with
a
clinical
dose
of
clozapine
(
10
mg
/
kg
)
showed
no
changes
in
striatal
D2R
mRNA
expression
when
assayed
by
quantitative
RT-PCR
.

Treatment
of
PC12
cells
with
the
specific
D2R
agonist
anti-parkinsonian
drug
,
bromocriptine
mesylate
(
BCM;
5
microM
)
also
resulted
in
decreased
D2R
/
luciferase
reporter
activity
(
27%
)
.

In
contrast
to
clozapine
,
a
clinical
dose
of
BCM
(
16
mg
/
kg
)
led
to
a
21%
decrease
and
a
45%
increase
in
striatal
D2R
mRNA
expression
in
male
and
female
mice
,
respectively
,
after
24
h
.

Coadministration
of
clozapine
and
BCM
in
PC12
cells
resulted
in
a
synergistic
decrease
in
D2R
/
luciferase
reporter
expression
(
68%
)
,
and
coadministration
of
these
drugs
in
vivo
led
to
decreases
in
striatal
D2R
mRNA
expression
in
both
male
and
female
mice
(
45%
and
22%
,
respectively
)
.

Collectively
,
these
results
indicate
that
clozapine
,
BCM
,
or
a
combination
of
these
drugs
have
differential
effects
on
dopamine
receptor
gene
expression
and
might
also

(
>C10-C16

,
F3
(
>C16-C34

,
and
F4

.

Previous
toxicity
tests
with
earthworms
and
F2
,
as
well
as
two
subfractions
of
F3
,
F3a
(
>C16-C23
)
and
F3a
(
>C23-C34
)
,
indicate
that
test
durations
might
not
be
sufficiently
long
to
reach
threshold
effect
concentrations
,
likely
because
of
the
differing
toxicokinetics
for
each
distillate
.

A
study
was
conducted
to
determine
the
toxicokinetics
of
both
aliphatic
and
aromatic
fractions
of
F2
,
F3a
,
and
F3b
with
the
earthworm
Eisenia
andrei
.

Peak
accumulation
curves
were
observed
for
F2
aliphatics
and
aromatics
and
F3a
aromatics
,
likely
as
a
result
of
changes
in
exposure
concentration
over
the
test
duration
via
loss
or
a
decrease
in
the
bioavailable
fraction
.

Biota-soil
accumulation
factors
were
>1
for
total
F2
aliphatics
and
aromatics
and
F3a
aromatics
as
well
as
for
several
individual
polyaromatic
hydrocarbons
for
each
distillate
.

Aromatics
were
disproportionately
accumulated
over
aliphatics
and
were
the
main
contributors
to
toxicity;
therefore
,
aromatics
and
aliphatics
should
be
regulated
separately
.

The
toxicokinetics
were
used
to
interpret
previous
toxicity
data
.

Higher
molecular
weight
distillates
need
longer-than-standard
test
durations
to
determine
toxicity
,
so
toxicity
test
results
from
fixed
,
standard-duration
tests
are
not
strictly
comparable
for
these
petroleum
distillates
.

can
be
classified
as
either

Six

cloned

Abstract
Vegetable-based
diets
have
generally
focused
on
their
health
benefits
including
negative
associations
with
the
serum
cholesterol
concentrations
.

The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
investigate
whether
serum
lipid
concentrations
are
influenced
by
the
amount
of
kimchi
intake
.

For
the
study
,
100
volunteers
were
assigned
to
2
dietary
groups
,
low
(
15
g
/
day
,
n
=
50
)
and
high
(
210
g
/
day
,
n
=
50
)
kimchi
intake
,
and
were
housed
together
in
a
dormitory
for
7
days
.

Identical
meals
except
with
different
amount
of
kimchi
were
provided
and
subjects
were
instructed
to
maintain
their
normal
physical
activity
.

Concentrations
of
fasting
blood
glucose
(
FBG
)
,
total
glucose
,
total
cholesterol
and
low
density
lipoprotein
(
LDL
)
-C
significantly
decreased
in
both
groups
after
7
days
of
kimchi
intake
,
but
the
effects
were
dose
dependent
.

Lipid
lowering
effects
of
kimchi
were
more
profound
in
the
subjects
with
total
cholesterol
and
LDL-C
level
over
190
and
130
mg
/
dL
,
respectively
,
in
both
groups
.

FBG
was
significantly
decreased
in
the
high
kimchi
intake
as
compared
to
the
low
intake
group
(
P
=
.
003
)
.

In
conclusion
,
greater
consumption
of
kimchi
improved
FBG
and
serum
total
cholesterol
in
young
healthy
adults
.

Obstructive
sleep
apnea
(
OSA
)
is
associated
with
cardiovascular
complications
including
hypertension
.

Previous
findings
from
our
laboratory
indicate
that
exposure
to
intermittent
hypoxia
(
IH
)
,
to
mimic
sleep
apnea
,
increases
blood
pressure
in
rats
.

IH
also
increases
endothelin-1
(
ET-1
)
constrictor
sensitivity
in
a
protein
kinase
C
(
PKC
)
δ-dependent
manner
in
mesenteric
arteries
.

Because
phosphoinositide-dependent
kinase-1
(
PDK-1
)
regulates
PKCδ
activity
,
we
hypothesized
that
PDK-1
contributes
to
the
augmented
ET-1
constrictor
sensitivity
and
elevated
blood
pressure
following
IH
.

Male
Sprague-Dawley
rats
were
exposed
to
either
sham
or
IH
(
cycles
between
21%
O
(
2
)
/
0%
CO
(
2
)
and
5%
O
(
2
)
/
5%
CO
(
2
)
)
conditions
for
7
h
/
day
for
14
or
21
days
.

The
contribution
of
PKCδ
and
PDK-1
to
ET-1-mediated
vasoconstriction
was
assessed
in
mesenteric
arteries
using
pharmacological
inhibitors
.

Constrictor
sensitivity
to
ET-1
was
enhanced
in
arteries
from
IH-exposed
rats
.

Inhibition
of
PKCδ
or
PDK-1
blunted
ET-1
constriction
in
arteries
from
IH
but
not
sham
group
rats
.

Western
analysis
revealed
similar
levels
of
total
and
phosphorylated
PDK-1
in
arteries
from
sham
and
IH
group
rats
but
decreased
protein-protein
interaction
between
PKCδ
and
PDK-1
in
arteries
from
IH-
compared
with
sham-exposed
rats
.

Blood
pressure
was
increased
in
rats
exposed
to
IH
,
and
treatment
with
the
PDK-1
inhibitor
OSU-03012
[
2-amino-N-{4-
[
5-
(
2-phenanthrenyl
)
-3-
(
trifluoromethyl
)
-1H-pyrazol-1-yl
]
-phenyl}-acetamide
]
(
33
mg
/
day
)
lowered
blood
pressure
in
IH
but
not
sham
group
rats
.

Our
results
suggest
that
exposure
to
IH
unmasks
a
role
for
PDK-1
in
regulating
ET-1
constrictor
sensitivity
and
blood
pressure
that
is
not
present
under
normal
conditions
.

These
novel
findings
suggest
that
PDK-1
may
be
a
uniquely
effective
antihypertensive
therapy
for
OSA
patients
.

Obesity
is
associated
with
a
major
prevalence
of
cardiovascular
risk
factors
and
high
risk
of
cardiovascular
events
and
contributes
to
the
increase
in
cardiovascular
morbidity
and
mortality
worldwide
.

Beyond
the
fat
mass
per
se
,
the
pattern
of
fat
distribution
has
a
profound
influence
on
cardiometabolic
risk
.

The
increase
in
abdominal
adipose
tissue
confers
an
independent
risk
,
while
the
amount
of
gluteofemoral
body
fat
is
thought
to
be
protective
.

Changes
in
the
capacity
of
different
depots
to
store
and
release
fatty
acids
and
to
produce
adipocytokines
are
important
determinants
of
fat
distribution
and
its
metabolic
consequences
.

Because
of
the
complexity
of
the
assessment
of
body
fat
with
imaging
techniques
,
great
attention
has
been
paid
to
other
measures
of
adiposity
,
such
as
waist
circumference
(
WC
)
,
waist-to-hip
ratio
(
WHR
)
and
waist-to-height
ratio
(
WHtR
)
,
which
provide
information
on
body
fat
distribution
,
although
BMI
is
the
established
clinical
measure
to
estimate
the
cardiovascular
risk
disease
associated
with
excessive
body
weight
.

Abdominal
obesity
is
a
main
predictive
factor
of
the
Metabolic
Syndrome
,
so
it
is
certain
that
it
represents
a
better
marker
of
cardiovascular
risk
than
BMI
.

Visceral
adiposity
index
(
VAI
)
has
recently
proven
to
be
a
marker
of
visceral
adipose
distribution
and
function
,
associated
with
insulin
sensitivity
in
patients
at
metabolic
risk;
however
,
the
evidence
needs
to
be
further
confirmed
.

In
summary
,
BMI
,
WC
,
WHR
,
WHtR
and
VAI
are
all
useful
tools
for
assessing
adiposity
/
obesity
in
clinical
practice
,
and
should
be
evaluated
along
with
other
cardiometabolic
risk
factors
to
define
cardiovascular
risk
stratification
.

BACKGROUND
:
The
aim
of
this

was
to
investigate
the
effects
of
two
imidazoline-derived
intravenous
anesthetics
,
etomidate
and
midazolam
,
on
vascular

.

METHODS
:
In
isolated

,
isometric
tension
was
recorded
to
examine
the
anesthetic
effects
on
vasodilator
response
to
levcromakalim
,
a
selective
KATP
channel
opener
.

Using
the
patch
clamp
method
,
the
anesthetic
effects
were
also
examined
on
the
currents
through
(

)
native
vascular

,
(

RESULTS
:
Etomidate
(

m
)
,
but
not
midazolam
(
up
to
10
m
)
,
inhibited
the

,
which
was

.

Etomidate
(

also
inhibited

,
Kir6

CONCLUSIONS
:
Clinical
concentrations
of
etomidate
,
but
not
midazolam
,
inhibit
the
KATP
channel
activity
in
vascular
smooth
muscle
cells
.

The
inhibition
is
presumably
through
its
effects
on
the
Kir6
.
0
subunit
,
but
not
on
the
SUR
subunit
,
with
the
binding
site
different
from

acid
level
.
Metabolism
of
vitamin
A
,
all-trans-retinol
,
leads
to
the
formation
of
11-cis-retinaldehyde
,
the
visual
chromophore
,
and
all-trans-retinoic
acid
,
which
is
involved
in
the
regulation
of
gene
expression
through
the
retinoic
acid
receptor
.

Enzymes
and
binding
proteins
involved
in
retinoid
metabolism
are
highly
conserved
across
species
.

We
previously
described
a
novel
mammalian
enzyme
that
saturates
the
13-14
double
bond
of
all-trans-retinol
to
produce
all-trans-13
,
14-dihydroretinol
,
which
then
follows
the
same
metabolic
fate
as
that
of
all-trans-retinol
.

Specifically
,
all-trans-13
,
14-dihydroretinol
is
transiently
oxidized
to
all-trans-13
,
14-dihydroretinoic
acid
before
being
oxidized
further
by
Cyp26
enzymes
.

Here
,
we
report
the
identification
of
two
putative
RetSat
homologues
in
zebrafish
,
one
of
which
,
zebrafish
RetSat
A
(
zRetSat
A
)
,
also
had
retinol
saturase
activity
,
whereas
zebrafish
RetSat
B
(
zRetSat
B
)
was
inactive
under
similar
conditions
.

Unlike
mouse
RetSat
(
mRetSat
)
,
zRetSat
A
had
an
altered
bond
specificity
saturating
either
the
13-14
or
7-8
double
bonds
of
all-trans-retinol
to
produce
either
all-trans-13
,
14-dihydroretinol
or
all-trans-7
,
8-dihydroretinol
,
respectively
.

zRetSat
A
also
saturated
the
13-14
or
7-8
double
bonds
of
all-trans-3
,
4-didehydroretinol
(
vitamin
A2
)
,
a
second
endogenous
form
of
vitamin
A
in
zebrafish
.

The
dual
enzymatic
activity
of
zRetSat
A
displays
a
newly
acquired
specificity
for
the
13-14
double
bond
retained
in
higher
vertebrates
and
also
the
evolutionarily
preserved
activity
of
bacterial
phytoene
desaturases
and
plant
carotenoid
isomerases
.

Expression
of
zRetSat
A
was
restricted
to
the
liver
and
intestine
of
hatchlings
and
adult
zebrafish
,
whereas
zRetSat
B
was
expressed
in
the
same
tissues
but
at
earlier
developmental
stages
.

Exogenous
all-trans-retinol
,
all-trans-13
,
14-dihydroretinol
,
or
all-trans-7
,
8-dihydroretinol
led
to
the
strong
induction
of
the
expression
of
the
retinoic
acid-metabolizing
enzyme
,
Cyp26A1
,
arguing
for
an
active
signaling
function
of
dihydroretinoid
metabolites
in
zebrafish
.

These
findings
point
to
a
conserved
function
but
altered
specificity
of
RetSat
in
vertebrates
,
leading
to
the
generation
of
various
dihydroretinoid
compounds
,
some
of
which
could
have
signaling
functions
.
Furanodiene
(
FUR
)
is
a
natural
terpenoid
isolated
from
Rhizoma
Curcumae
,
a
well-known
Chinese
medicinal
herb
that
presents
anti-proliferative
activities
in
several
cancer
cell
lines
.

Recently
,
we
found
that
the
combined
treatment
of
FUR
with
paclitaxel
(
TAX
)
showed
synergetic
anti-proliferative
activities
in
95-D
lung
cancer
cells
.

Herein
,
we
showed
that
FUR
reduced
the
cell
numbers
distributed
in
mitosis
phase
induced
by
TAX
while
increased
those
in
G1
phase
.

The
protein
levels
of
cyclin
D1
,
cyclin
B1
,
CDK6
and
c-Myc
were
all
down-regulated
in
the
group
of
combined
treatment
.

The
dramatically
down-regulated
expression
of
integrin
β4
,
focal
adhesion
kinase
and
paxillin
might
partially
contribute
to
the
synergic
effect
.

Though
FUR
alone
obviously
induced
endoplasmic
reticulum
stress
,
this
signaling
pathway
may
not
contribute
to
the
synergetic
anti-proliferative
effect
as
the
protein
expression
of
CHOP
and
BIP
was
similar
in
FUR
alone
and
combined
treatment
group
.

Niemann-Pick
disease
type
C
(
NP-C
)
is
a
lipid
storage
disorder
characterized
by
the
accumulation
of
unesterified
cholesterol
and
glycolipids
in
the
lysosomal
/
late
endosomal
system
of
certain
cells
in
the
central
nervous
system
(
CNS
)
and
visceral
organs
.

Clinical
symptoms
include
progressive
neurological
deterioration
and
visceral
organomegaly
.

Miglustat
,
a
small
iminosugar
molecule
approved
for
the
treatment
of
Gaucher
disease
,
reversibly
inhibits
glucosylceramide
synthase
,
which
catalyses
the
first
committed
step
in
glycosphingolipid
synthesis
.

The
physicochemical
properties
of
miglustat
allow
it
to
cross
the
blood-brain
barrier
and
suggest
possible
benefits
in
lysosomal
storage
diseases
affecting
the
CNS
.

Here
,
we
present
findings
in
two
children
with
NP-C
,
aged
14
years
(
patient
1
)
and
9
years
(
patient
2
)
,
treated
with
miglustat
for
1
year
.

Before
treatment
,
patient
1
presented
with
severe
difficulties
in
swallowing
and
walking
,
and
patient
2
with
problems
mostly
affecting
communication
and
social
interaction
.

Videofluoroscopic
studies
in
patient
1
demonstrated
a
substantial
improvement
in
swallowing
by
month
6
of
treatment
,
and
ambulation
index
measurements
indicated
improved
walking
.

Mini
Mental-State
Examination
(
MMSE
)
assessments
in
patient
2
showed
cognitive
improvement
by
month
6
,
which
was
sustained
up
to
month
12
.

Liver
/
spleen
volume
and
plasma
chitotriosidase
activities
were
stabilized
in
both
cases
.

There
was
no
weight
loss
during
treatment
.

Patient
1
experienced
severe
but
self-limiting
paresthesia
,
which
was
not
associated
with
peripheral
neuropathy
.

We
conclude
that
miglustat
can
provide
therapeutic
benefits
in
CNS
symptoms
and
allows
stabilization
of
systemic
disease
in
childhood-onset
NP-C
.

Further
follow-up
is
crucial
to
determine
the
long-term
maintenance
of
these
effects
.
Marked
improvement
in
glycemic
control
occurs
in
patients
with
type
2
diabetes
(
T2DM
)
shortly
after
Roux-en-Y
gastric
bypass
surgery
(
RYGB
)
and
before
there
is
major
weight
loss
.

The
objective
of
this
study
was
to
determine
if
the
magnitude
of
this
change
is
primarily
due
to
caloric
restriction
or
is
unique
to
the
surgical
procedure
.

We
studied
eleven
subjects
who
underwent
RYGB
and
fourteen
subjects
mean-matched
for
BMI
,
HbA1c
and
diabetes
duration
who
were
admitted
to
our
inpatient
research
unit
and
given
a
very
low
calorie
diet
(
VLCD
)
of
500
kcal
/
day
with
a
macronutrient
content
similar
to
that
consumed
by
patients
after
RYGB
.

Frequently
sampled
intravenous
glucose
tolerance
tests
were
performed
before
and
after
interventions
.

Both
groups
lost
an
equivalent
amount
of
weight
over
a
mean
study
period
of
21
days
.

Insulin
sensitivity
,
acute
insulin
secretion
after
intravenous
glucose
administration
and
beta-cell
function
as
determined
by
disposition
index
improved
to
a
similar
extent
in
both
groups
.

Likewise
,
changes
in
fasting
glucose
and
fructosamine
levels
were
similar
.

Based
on
these
data
,
VLCD
improves
insulin
sensitivity
and
beta-cell
function
just
as
well
as
RYGB
in
the
short
term
.

study

Genetic

patients

rheumatoid
arthritis
.
Short
QT
syndrome
is
a
new
genetic
disorder
associated
with
familial
atrial
fibrillation
and
/
or
sudden
death
or
syncope
.

To
date
,
different
mutations
in
genes
encoding
for
cardiac
ion
channels
(
KCNH2
,
KCNQ1
,
and
KCNJ2
)
have
been
identified
to
cause
the
short
QT
syndrome
.

The
mutations
lead
to
a
gain
of
function
of
the
affected
current
(
IKr
,
IKs
,
and
IK1
)
.

The
phenotype
is
characterized
by
a
shortened
QT
interval<335
ms
after
correction
for
heart
rate
at
rates<80
beats
/
min
.

Furthermore
,
the
QT
interval
poorly
adapts
to
heart
rate
.

Patients
exhibit
shortened
atrial
and
ventricular
effective
refractory
periods
and
,
in
the
majority
,
inducibility
of
ventricular
fibrillation
.

Death
occurs
already
in
newborns
.

Therapy
of
choice
seems
to
be
the
implantable
cardioverter
defibrillator
because
of
the
high
incidence
of
sudden
death
.

Pharmacological
treatment
has
been
studied
and
it
could
be
demonstrated
,
that
some
mutant
currents
may
be
insufficiently
suppressed
by
drugs
targeted
to
block
the
specific
current
such
as
,
e
.

,
sotalol
or
ibutilide
in
patients
with
a
mutation
in
the
IKr-coding
gene
KCNH2
(
HERG
)
.

Quinidine
proved
to
be
efficient
in
prolonging
the
QT
interval
and
normalizing
the
effective
refractory
periods
in
some
patients
.
One
new
compound
named
amauroamoienin
(
1
)
,
together
with
thirteen
known
compounds
(
2-14
)
,
was
isolated
from
the
EtOAc
extract
of
Amauroderma
amoiensis
.

The
structures
of
these
compounds
were
elucidated
by
the
analysis
of
1D
and
2D
spectroscopic
data
and
the
MS
technique
.

The
bioassays
of
inhibitory
activities
of
these
isolates
against
acetylcholinesterase
were
evaluated
,
and
compounds
1
,
3
,
and
5
exhibited
acetylcholinesterase
inhibitory
activities
.
The
preferred
initial
agents
for
the
treatment
of
high
blood
pressure
are
low-dose
thiazide
diuretics
,
beta
blockers
,
calcium
antagonists
,
and
angiotensin-converting
enzyme
(
ACE
)
inhibitors
.

In
high-risk
patients
,
including
those
with
diabetes
,
renal
insufficiency
,
left
ventricular
dysfunction
,
and
atherosclerosis
,
ACE
inhibitors
may
have
specific
benefit
in
reducing
cardiovascular
morbidity
and
mortality
.

Omapatrilat
,
the
prototypical
vasopeptidase
inhibitor
,
inhibits
not
only
ACE
but
also
neutral
endopeptidase
.

Like
conventional
ACE
inhibitors
,
omapatrilat
causes
extracellular
volume
reduction
and
vasodilatation;
moreover
,
it
increases
levels
of
atrial
and
brain
natriuretic
peptides
and
bradykinin
.

Effective
blood
pressure
control
,
especially
in
the
high-risk
patient
,
usually
necessitates
combination
therapy
.

A
recent
study
randomized
274
subjects
with
mild
to
severe
hypertension
(
stages
1-3
diastolic
blood
pressure
elevation
)
and
confirmed
the
benefits
of
omapatrilat
combined
with
hydrochlorothiazide
in
patients
not
controlled
on
hydrochlorothiazide
alone
.

The
frequencies
of
adverse
events
,
serious
adverse
events
,
and
discontinuation
attributed
to
adverse
events
were
similar
for
omapatrilat
and
placebo
.

Furthermore
,
there
were
no
clinically
significant
changes
in
serum
creatinine
,
potassium
,
or
other
laboratory
parameters
.

Adding
omapatrilat
to
the
background
of
hydrochlorothiazide
treatment
produced
statistically
significant
additional
reductions
in
trough
diastolic
and
systolic
blood
pressures
at
weeks
4
and
8
.
Leydig
cell
hyperplasia
and
Leydig
cell
tumours
of
the
ovary
are
rare
.

We
present
two
cases
in
which
patients
had
increased
blood
levels
of
testosterone
and
frank
hirsutism
.

Imaging
showed
minimal
abnormalities
.

After
adrenal
disease
had
been
ruled
out
,
they
underwent
a
bilateral
oophorectomy
.

One
case
showed
a
Leydig
cell
hyperplasia
,
the
other
a
Leydig
cell
tumour
.

An
androgen
producing
tumour
should
be
excluded
in
every
woman
with
evidence
of
hirsutism
or
frank
virilization
and
markedly
elevated
testosterone
levels
.

Adrenal
disease
with
androgen
hypersecretion
can
be
suspected
by
detailed
clinical
,
laboratory
and
radiologic
imaging
.

Although
DHEAS
has
a
good
sensitivity
in
the
detection
of
adrenal
origin
of
hyperandrogenism
(
and
hence
a
good
negative
predictive
value
)
it
is
not
specific
(
specificity
ranging
from
85
to
98%
)
.

Imaging
of
the
ovaries
can
be
helpful
but
does
not
rule
out
ovarian
disease
if
normal
.

Indeed
,
diffuse
stromal
Leydig
cell
hyperplasia
and
Leydig
cell
tumours
(
usually
small
)
may
escape
imaging
and
in
some
cases
diagnosis
can
only
be
made
on
pathology
.

As
these
clinical
entities
represent
a
diagnostic
and
therapeutic
challenge
,
oophorectomy
should
be
considered
in
postmenopausal
women
with
hirsutism
and
elevated
testosterone
levels
,
after
the
exclusion
of
adrenal
causes
.

The
procedure
is
relatively
safe
and
effective
.

Follow-up
remains
indicated

PURPOSE
:
Transaldolase
deficiency
is
a
recently
described
inborn
error
of
pentose
phosphate
pathway
.

We
conducted
this
study
to
further
delineate
the
associated
phenotype
.

METHODS
AND
RESULTS
:
We
report
on
12
new
cases
representing
six
families
with
this
metabolic
defect
that
were
observed
over
an
8
year
span
.

None
of
these
cases
received
the
correct
diagnosis
initially
because
of
significant
overlap
in
the
presenting
symptoms
(
growth
retardation
,
dysmorphic
features
,
cutis
laxa
,
congenital
heart
disease
,
hepatosplenomegaly
,
pancytopenia
,
and
bleeding
tendency
)
with
a
wide
range
of
genetic
disorders
.

However
,
the
consanguineous
nature
of
these
families
allowed
us
to
pursue
autozygome
analysis
,
which
highlighted
TALDO
as
the
likely
candidate
gene
and
sequencing
confirmed
segregation
of
a
novel
homozygous
mutation
with
the
disease
in
all
the
studied
families
.

Biochemical
analysis
was
also
consistent
with
transaldolase
deficiency
.

CONCLUSION
:
This
study
expands
the
clinical
definition
of
transaldolase
deficiency
,
and
adds
to
its
allelic
heterogeneity
.

In
addition
,
we
emphasize
the
diagnostic
challenge
posed
by
this
rare
and
pleiotropic
metabolic
disorder
.
Throughout
the
world
many
people
use
artificial
sweeteners
(
AS
)
for
the
purpose
of
reducing
caloric
intake
.

The
most
prominently
used
of
these
molecules
include
saccharin
,
aspartame
(
Nutrasweet
)
,
acesulfame-K
,
and
cyclamate
.

Despite
the
caloric
advantage
they
provide
,
one
key
concern
in
their
use
is
their
aversive
aftertaste
that
has
been
characterized
on
a
sensory
level
as
bitter
and
/
or
metallic
.

Recently
,
it
has
been
shown
that
the
activation
of
particular
T2R
bitter
taste
receptors
is
partially
involved
with
the
bitter
aftertaste
sensation
of
saccharin
and
acesulfame-K
.

To
more
fully
understand
the
biology
behind
these
phenomena
we
have
addressed
the
question
of
whether
AS
could
stimulate
transient
receptor
potential
vanilloid-1
(
TRPV1
)
receptors
,
as
these
receptors
are
activated
by
a
large
range
of
structurally
different
chemicals
.

Moreover
,
TRPV1
receptors
and
/
or
their
variants
are
found
in
taste
receptor
cells
and
in
nerve
terminals
throughout
the
oral
cavity
.

Hence
,
TRPV1
activation
could
be
involved
in
the
AS
aftertaste
or
even
contribute
to
the
poorly
understood
metallic
taste
sensation
.

Using
Ca
(
2
+
)
imaging
on
TRPV1
receptors
heterologously
expressed
in
the
human
embryonic
kidney
(
HEK
)
293
cells
and
on
dissociated
primary
sensory
neurons
,
we
find
that
in
both
systems
,
AS
activate
TRPV1
receptors
,
and
,
moreover
,
they
sensitize
these
channels
to
acid
and
heat
.

We
also
found
that
TRPV1
receptors
are
activated
by
CuSO
(
4
)
,
ZnSO
(
4
)
,
and
FeSO
(
4
)
,
three
salts
known
to
produce
a
metallic
taste
sensation
.

In
summary
,
our
results
identify
a
novel
group
of
compounds
that
activate
TRPV1
and
,
consequently
,
provide
a
molecular
mechanism
that
may
account
for
off
tastes
of
sweeteners
and
metallic
tasting
salts
.
Elevation
of
renal
interstitial
hydrostatic
pressure
(
RIHP
)
by
direct
renal
interstitial
volume
expansion
increases
sodium
excretion
.

This
natriuretic
response
is
blunted
by
the
nonspecific
inhibition
of
the
cyclooxygenase
(
COX
)
enzymes
.

The
present
study
tested
the
hypothesis
that
the
natriuretic
response
to
increased
RIHP
during
direct
renal
interstitial
volume
expansion
is
dependent
on
COX-1
but
not
COX-2
.

RIHP
and
fractional

of
sodium
(

)
were
measured
before
and
after
direct

in
control
rats
(
n

,
rats
infused

.

In

,
respectively
.

In
contrast
,

of

.

Infusion

but
not

or

blunted
the
natriuretic
response
to
increased

,
suggesting
that
the
natriuretic
response
to
increased

may
be
preserved

Androgens
mediate
a
wide
range
of
processes
during
embryogenesis
and
in
the
adult
.

In
mammals
,
the
principal
androgens
are
testosterone
and
its
5alpha-reduced
metabolite
,
5alpha-dihydrotestosterone
(
DHT
)
.

Although
these
androgenic
hormones
are
diverse
in
character
,
it
is
believed
that
their
effects
are
mediated
via
the
protein
products
of
a
single
androgen
receptor
gene
encoded
on
the
X-chromosome
.

A
great
deal
of
information
has
now
accumulated
pertaining
to
the
mechanisms
by
which
nuclear
receptors
,
such
as
the
androgen
receptor
,
modulate
the
activity
of
responsive
genes
.

The
studies
have
demonstrated
the
participation
of
a
number
of
ancillary
proteins
in
modulating
activation
or
repression
by
nuclear
receptors
.

In
addition
to
studies
focused
on
the
mechanisms
of
nuclear
receptor
function
,
additional
work
has
illuminated
the
mechanism
by
which
androgens
are
metabolized
in
selected
tissues
.

This
information
provides
a
perspective
on
the
number
of
levels
of
complexity
by
which
differential
gene
regulation
by
androgens
may
occur
in
different
tissues
and
in
different
cell
types
.

Different
autoantigens
are
thought
to
be
involved
in
the
pathogenesis
of
insulin-dependent
diabetes
mellitus
,
and
they
may
account
for
the
variation
in
the
clinical
presentation
of
the
disease
.

Sera
from
patients
with
autoimmune
polyendocrine
syndrome
type
I
contain
autoantibodies
against
the
beta-cell
proteins
glutamate
decarboxylase
and
an
unrelated
51-kDa
antigen
.

By
screening
of
an
expression
library
derived
from
rat
insulinoma
cells
,
we
have
identified
the
51-kDa
protein
as
aromatic-L-amino-acid
decarboxylase
(
EC
4
.
1
.
1
.
28
)
.

In
addition
to
the
previously
published
full-length
cDNA
,
forms
coding
for
a
truncated
and
an
alternatively
spliced
version
were
identified
.

Aromatic
L-amino
acid
decarboxylase
catalyzes
the
decarboxylation
of
L-5-hydroxytryptophan
to
serotonin
and
that
of
L-3
,
4-dihydroxyphenylalanine
to
dopamine
.

Interestingly
,
pyridoxal
phosphate
is
the
cofactor
of
both
aromatic
L-amino
acid
decarboxylase

Spinal
and
bulbar
muscular
atrophy
(
SBMA
)
is
an
inherited
motor
neuron
disease
caused
by
the
expansion
of
a
polyglutamine
(
polyQ
)
tract
within
the
androgen
receptor
(
AR
)
gene
.

The
pathologic
features
of
SBMA
are
motor
neuron
loss
in
the
spinal
cord
and
brainstem
,
and
diffuse
nuclear
accumulation
and
nuclear
inclusions
of
mutant
AR
in
residual
motor
neurons
and
certain
visceral
organs
.

AR-associated
coregulator
70
(
ARA70
)
was
the
first
coregulator
of
AR
to
be
identified
,
and
it
has
been
shown
to
interact
with
AR
and
increase
its
protein
stability
.

Here
,
we
report
that
genistein
,
an
isoflavone
found
in
soy
,
disrupts
the
interaction
between
AR
and
ARA70
and
promotes
the
degradation
of
mutant
AR
in
neuronal
cells
and
transgenic
mouse
models
of
SBMA
.

We
also
demonstrate
that
dietary
genistein
ameliorates
behavioral
abnormalities
,
improves
spinal
cord
and
muscle
pathology
,
and
decreases
the
amounts
of
monomeric
AR
and
high-molecular-weight
mutant
AR
protein
aggregates
in
SBMA
transgenic
mice
.

Thus
,
genistein
treatment
may
be
a
potential
therapeutic
approach
for
alleviating
the
symptoms
of
SBMA
by
disrupting
the
interactions
between
AR
and
ARA70
.

Resistant
variants
of
the
human
leukaemic
line
K562
were
developed
using
selection
with
the
deoxynucleoside
analogues
cytosine
arabinoside
,
2-chlorodeoxyadenosine
,
fludarabine
and
gemcitabine
.

The
resistant
lines
displayed
a
high
degree
of
cross
resistance
to
all
deoxynucleoside
analogues
,
with
little
or
no
cross
resistance
to
other
agents
.

There
was
a
profound
accumulation
defect
of
all
nucleoside
analogues
in
the
resistant
variants
but
no
significant
defect
in
nucleoside
transport
in
any
of
the
variants
.

5'
nucleotidase
activity
was
strongly
increased
and
deoxycytidine
kinase
activity
was
moderately
reduced
in
all
of
the
resistant
variants
,
resulting
in
reduced
accumulation
of
triphosphate
analogues
.

In
addition
a
deletion
in
one
of
the
alleles
of
the
deoxycytidine
kinase
was
detected
in
the
fludarabine-resistant
line
.

Ribonucleotide
reductase
activity
was
found
to
be
strongly
increased
in
the
gemcitabine-selected
line
and
purine
nucleoside
phosphorylase
was
increased
in
the
2-chlorodeoxyadenosine-selected
line
.

Free
nucleotide
pools
were
increased
in
the
2-chlorodeoxyadenosine-selected
line
.

There
was
no
expression
of
the
mdr1
gene
by
the
resistant
lines
.

Karyotypic
analysis
and
FISH
experiments
using
a
6q21
specific
probe
showed
alterations
in
the
6
(
q16-q22
)
region
which
contains
the
5'-nucleotidase
gene
.

Early
events
in
the
activation
and
degradation
of
deoxynucleoside
analogues
appear
to
constitute
common
mechanisms
of
resistance
to
these
compounds
.
The
evolutionary
relationship
and
functional
correlation
between
human
formyl
peptide
receptors
(
FPRs
)
and
their
mouse
counterparts
remain
incompletely
understood
.

We
examined
three
members
of
the
mouse
formyl
peptide
receptor
subfamily
(
mFprs
)
and
found
that
they
differ
in
agonist
preference
and
cellular
distributions
.

When
stably
expressed
in
transfected
rat
basophilic
leukemia
(
RBL-2H3
)
cells
,
mFpr1
was
readily
activated
by
N-formylated
peptides
derived
from
Listeria
monocytogenes
(
fMIVTLF
)
,
Staphylococcus
aureus
(
fMIFL
)
,
and
mitochondria
(
fMMYALF
)
.

In
contrast
,
the
Escherichia
coli-derived
fMLF
was
1000-fold
less
potent
.

The
aforementioned
peptides
were
much
less
efficacious
at
mFpr2
,
which
responded
better
to
the
synthetic
hexapeptide
WKYMVm
,
the
synthetic
agonists
Quin-C1
(
a
substituted
quinazolinone
)
,
and
compound
43
(
a
nitrosylated
pyrazolone
derivative
)
.

Saturation
binding
assays
showed
that
mFpr1
and
mFpr2
were
expressed
at
similar
levels
on
the
cell
surface
,
although
their
affinity
for
N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe-Ile-Ile-Lys-fluorescein
isothiocyanate
varied
by
more
than
1000-fold
[
dissociation

(
K

)
values
of

nM
for
mFpr1
and

μM
for
mFpr2
]
)
.

Contrary
to
these
receptors
,
mFpr-rs1
responded
poorly
to
all
the
previously
mentioned
peptides
that
were
tested
.

Fluorescent
microscopy
revealed
an
intracellular
distribution
pattern
of
mFpr-rs1
.

On
the
basis
of
these
results
,
we
conclude
that
mFpr1
is
an
ortholog
of
human
FPR1
with
certain
pharmacologic
properties
of
human
FPR2
/
ALX
,
whereas
mFpr2
has
much
lower
affinity
for
formyl
peptides
.

The
intracellular
distribution
of
mFpr-rs1
suggests
an
evolutionary
correlation
with
human
FPR3
.

As
part
of
the
National
Institute
for
Health
and
Clinical
Excellence
(
NICE
)
single
technology
appraisal
(
STA
)
process
,
the
manufacturer
of
golimumab
(
Simponi
(
®
)
;
Merck
Sharp
&
Dohme
,
USA
)
was
invited
to
submit
evidence
for
its
clinical
and
cost
effectiveness
for
the
treatment
of
rheumatoid
arthritis
(
RA
)
after
the
failure
of
previous
disease-modifying
antirheumatic
drugs
(
DMARDs
)
.

The
School
of
Health
and
Related
Research
Technology
Appraisal
Group
(
ScHARR-TAG
)
at
The
University
of
Sheffield
was
commissioned
to
act
as
the
independent
Evidence
Review
Group
(
ERG
)
.

This
article
provides
details
of
the
manufacturer's
initial
submission
,
the
ERG's
clarification
questions
and
the
ERG
report
submitted
to
NICE
.

The
decision
made
by
NICE
is
provided
alongside
a
brief
comment
on
additional
results
produced
from
an
additional
analysis
requested
by
NICE
on
behalf
of
the
Committee
.

The
ERG
produced
a
critical
review
of
the
evidence
for
the
clinical
and
cost
effectiveness
of
the
technology
based
on
upon
the
manufacturer's
submission
to
NICE
.

The
clinical
evidence
was
derived
from
three
randomized
controlled
trials
of
golimumab
in
the
treatment
of
moderate
to
severe
RA
:
GO-FORWARD
and
Kay
et
al
.

(
DMARD-experienced
population
)
and
GO-AFTER
(
tumour
necrosis
factor
[
TNF
]
-α
inhibitor-experienced
population
)
.

The
ERG
considered
that
the
trials
were
of
reasonable
methodological
quality
and
measured
a
clinically
relevant
range
of
outcomes
.

The
trials
for
golimumab
,
as
well
as
comparator
treatments
,
were
synthesized
using
mixed-treatment
comparison
methods
for
the
DMARD-experienced
population
and
an
indirect
comparison
using
the
Bucher
method
for
the
TNF-α
inhibitor-experienced
population
.

The
trials
used
were
appropriate
,
although
no
definitive
judgement
regarding
the
comparative
efficacy
of
golimumab
with
other
biologics
was
possible
.

The
manufacturer
provided
a
DMARD-experienced
population
model
and
a
TNF-α
inhibitor-experienced
population
model
.

The
models
allowed
sequences
of
treatments
to
be
evaluated
for
each
population
,
although
a
fully
incremental
analysis
between
the
use
of
golimumab
following
DMARD
failure
and
the
use
of
golimumab
following
TNF-α
inhibitor
failure
was
not
possible
.

Several
limitations
with
the
model
were
identified
,
and
after
a
request
from
NICE
and
suspension
of
the
appraisal
,
the
manufacturer
submitted
sensitivity
analyses
with
an
additional
American

rate
of
the

)
score
increase
for
patients
receiving
palliative
treatment
was
also
changed
from
0
.
09
to
0
.
06
.

The
further
analyses
provided
highlighted
the
particular
sensitivity
of
the
results
to
HAQ
progression
rates
and
the
re-administration
frequency
for
rituximab
in
the
TNF-α
inhibitor-experienced
population
.

The
Appraisal
Committee
concluded
that
golimumab
should
be
recommended
in
combination
with
methotrexate
as
an
option
for
patients
with
severe
active
RA
who
have
failed
on
conventional
DMARDs
,
or
who
have
failed
on
a
TNF-α
inhibitor
and
are
contraindicated
to
or
withdrawn
from
rituximab

,
increased
more
than

.

These
results
strongly
suggest
that
greater
expression
of
the
genes
encoding
enzymes
of
adenosine

is
closely
related
to
the
increased

The
increasing
prevalence
of
drug-resistant
tuberculosis
,
which
is
resistant
to
effective

,
presents
a
major

health
threat
.

The
thymidine

)
of
Mycobacterium

(
M
.

tuberculosis
)
,
which
is
an
essential
enzyme
for
the
maintenance
of
the
thymidine
triphosphate
pools
,
is
considered
an
attractive
target
for
the
development
of
effective
antibiotics
against
tuberculosis
.

In
this
study
,
we
attempted
to
identify
novel
chemical
compounds
that
specifically
target
the
M
.

tuberculosis
TMPK
(
mtTMPK
)
.

We
performed
in
silico
structure-based
drug
screening
using
the
crystal
structure
data
of
mtTMPK
and
a
large-scale
virtual
compound
library
,
which
is
composed
of
6
,
192
,
930
chemicals
.

Through
a
three-step
screening
method
using
the
DOCK
and
GOLD
,
we
identified
ten
chemical
compounds
that
were
predicted
to
have
high
binding
affinity
to
the
active
site
cleft
of
the
mtTMPK
.

We
then
evaluated
the
antibiotic
effects
of
these
chemical
compounds
on
model
mycobacteria
strains
.

As
a
result
,
we
found
that
a
chemical
compound
,
K10
,
completely
inhibited
the
growth
of
Mycobacterium
vanbaalenii
(
M
.

vanbaalenii
)
and
Mycobacterium

(

)
.

Moreover
,
K10
does
not
exhibit
any
toxic
effects
on
the
growth
of
enterobacteria
and
mammalian
cells
.

The
structural
and
experimental
information
regarding
this
novel
chemical
compound
,
K10
,
is
likely
to
be
useful
for
the
hit-to-lead
optimization
of
new
antibiotics
for
the
treatment
of
tuberculosis
.

Therapeutic
oral

K
antagonists
that
are
associated
with
an

pharmacokinetic

pharmacodynamic
(
PK
/
PD
)
profile
leading
to
a
high
incidence
of
bleeding

or
therapeutic

.

Hence
,
there
is
an
unmet
medical
need
of
novel
easy-to-use
oral
anticoagulants
with
improved
efficacy
and
safety
.

Recent
developments
include
the
identification
of
non-peptidic
small-molecules
that
selectively
inhibit
certain
serine
proteases
within
the
coagulation
cascade
.

Of
these
,
the
thrombin
inhibitor
dabigatran
and
factor
Xa
inhibitor
rivaroxaban
have
recently
been
licensed
for
thromboprophylaxis
after
orthopaedic
surgery
mainly
in
Europe
.

In
addition
,
the
factor
Xa
inhibitor
apixaban
is
in
late-stage
clinical
development
.

Each
drug
is
prescribed
at
fixed
doses
without
the
need
of
anticoagulant
monitoring
.

Phase
III
trials
in
orthopaedic
patients
essentially
resulted
in
non-inferior
efficacy
of
dabigatran
and
superior
efficacy
of
rivaroxaban
over
enoxaparin
without
any
marked
differences
of
drug
safety
,
while
apixaban
data
is
still
controversial
.

However
,
alterations
of
rivaroxaban
and
apixaban
pharmacokinetics
upon
interactions
with
inhibitors
and
inducers
of
CYP3A4
or
P-glycoprotein
may
complicate
the
use
of
these
compounds
in
daily
practice
,
whereas
dabigatran
elimination
largely
depends
on
renal
function
.

Hence
,
this
review
reports
PK

,
efficacy
and
safety
data
of
dabigatran
,
rivaroxaban
and
apixaban
throughout

Averaged
over
nuclear
vibrations
,
the
driving
force
to

,
ΔG
,
differs
from
the
static
estimate
.

It
depends
on
the
adsorption
mode
and
the
presence
of
H
(

)
O
but
is
almost
the
same
for
300
and
350
K
.

Recombination
to
the
dye
cation
is
expected
to
be
much
enhanced
by
the
approach
of
the
dye
oxidation
equivalent
hole
to
the
surface
during
dye
wagging
around
TiO
(

)
.

This
effect
is
somewhat
mitigated
by
the
co-adsorbed
water
.

The
dynamics
of
ΔG
(
t
)
are
explained
by
uncorrelated
evolution
of
the
energies
of
the
dye
excited
state
and
the
conduction
band
minimum
of
the
oxide
due
to
their
respective
vibrations
,
and
are
almost
independent
of
dye
orientation
.

It
may
therefore
be
possible
to
independently
control
the
conditions
of
recombination
and
of
injection
.

furan-4

5-dione
(
NFD
)
,
a
bioactive
component
of
Avicennia
marina
,
has
been
demonstrated
to
display
anti-cancer
activity
.

Activation
of
epidermal
growth
factor
receptor
(
EGFR
)
-induced
signaling
pathway
has
been
correlated
with
cancer
metastasis
in
various
tumors
,
including
breast
carcinoma
.

We
use
EGF
as
a
metastatic
inducer
of
MDA-MB-231
cells
to
investigate
the
effect
of
NFD
on
cell
migration
and
invasion
.

NFD
suppressed
EGF-mediated
protein
levels
of
c-Jun
and
c-Fos
,
and
reduced
MMP-9
expression
and
activity
,
concomitantly
with
a
marked
inhibition
on
cell
migration
and
invasion
without
obvious
cellular
cytotoxicity
.

NFD
abrogated
EGF-induced
phosphorylation
of
EGF
receptor
(
EGFR
)
and
phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase
(
PI3K
)
/
Akt
.

The
specific
PI3K
inhibitor
,
wortmannin
,
blocked
significantly
EGF-induced
cell
migration
and
invasion
.

Furthermore
,
the
EGFR
inhibitor
AG1478
inhibited
EGF-induced
MMP-9
expression
,
cell
migration
and
invasion
,
as
well
as
the
activation
of
PI3K
/
Akt
,
suggesting
that
PI3K
/
Akt
activation
occur
downstream
of
EGFR
activation
.

These
findings
suggest
that
NFD
inhibited
the
EGF-induced
invasion
and
migration
of
MDA-MB-231
cells
via
EGFR-dependent
PI3K
/
Akt
signaling
,
leading
to
the
down-regulation
of
MMP-9
expression
.

These
results
provide
a
novel
mechanism
to
explain
the
role
of
NFD
as
a
potent
anti-metastatic
agent
in
MDA-MB-231

Fibrates
and
glitazones
are
two
classes
of
drugs
currently
used
in
the
treatment
of
dyslipidemia
and
insulin
resistance
(
IR
)
,
respectively
.

Whereas
glitazones
are
insulin
sensitizers
acting
via
activation
of
the
peroxisome
proliferator-activated
receptor
(
PPAR
)
gamma
subtype
,
fibrates
exert
their
lipid-lowering
activity
via
PPARalpha
.

To
determine
whether
PPARalpha
activators
also
improve
insulin
sensitivity
,
we
measured
the
capacity
of
three
PPARalpha-selective
agonists
,
fenofibrate
,
ciprofibrate
,
and
the
new
compound
GW9578
,
in
two
rodent
models
of
high
fat
diet-induced
(
C57BL
/
6
mice
)
or
genetic
(
obese
Zucker
rats
)
IR
.

At
doses
yielding
serum
concentrations
shown
to
activate
selectively
PPARalpha
,
these
compounds
markedly
lowered
hyperinsulinemia
and
,
when
present
,
hyperglycemia
in
both
animal
models
.

This
effect
relied
on
the
improvement
of
insulin
action
on
glucose
utilization
,
as
indicated
by
a
lower
insulin
peak
in
response
to
intraperitoneal
glucose
in
ciprofibrate-treated
IR
obese
Zucker
rats
.

In
addition
,
fenofibrate
treatment
prevented
high
fat
diet-induced
increase
of
body
weight
and
adipose
tissue
mass
without
influencing
caloric
intake
.

The
specificity
for
PPARalpha
activation
in
vivo
was
demonstrated
by
marked
alterations
in
the
expression
of
PPARalpha
target
genes
,
whereas
PPARgamma
target
gene
mRNA
levels
did
not
change
in
treated
animals
.

These
results
indicate
that
compounds
with
a
selective
PPARalpha
activation
profile
reduce
insulin
resistance
without
having
adverse
effects
on
body
weight
and
adipose
tissue
mass
in
animal
models
of
IR
.
UNLABELLED
:
MODE
OF
ACTION
OF
NON-STEROIDAL
ANTI-INFLAMMATORY
DRUGS
:
Non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory
drugs
(
NSAID
)
exert
their
major
therapeutic
and
adverse
effects
by
inhibition
of
prostanoid
synthesis
.

Also
the
interactions
with
antihypertensive
drugs
and
lithium
are
caused
by
this
mechanism
of
action
.

Cyclooxygenation
is
a
key
enzymatic
step
in
the
synthesis
of
prostanoids
.

1990
2
isoforms
of
the
enzyme
cyclooxygenase
have
been
identified
:
Prostanoids
synthesized
by
the
constitutive
cyclooxygenase
(
COX-1
)
are
involved
in
physiological
homeostasis
.

In
contrast
,
the
inducible
cyclooxygenase
(
COX-2
)
produces
large
amounts
of
prostanoids
,
mainly
contributing
to
the
pathophysiological
process
of
inflammation
.

COX-2
SELECTIVE
NSAID
:
The
discovery
of
the
cyclooxgenase-isoenzymes
ushered
in
a
new
generation
of
NSAID
:
A
drug
with
selectivity
for
COX-2
would
inhibit
proinflammatory
prostanoid
synthesis
while
sparing
physiologic
prostanoid
synthesis
.

Thus
,
a
selective
COX-2
inhibitor
should
be
anti-inflammatory
with
less
or
no
gastrointestinal
or
other
NSAID-typical
adverse
effects
.

The
experiences
with
currently
used
NSAID
,
which
show
an
increasing
incidence
of
side
effects
as
COX-1
inhibition
increases
,
and
studies
with
the
COX-2
selective
NSAID
salsalate
and
meloxicam
,
which
have
less
adverse
effects
than
nonselective
COX
inhibitors
in
equivalent
antiphlogistic
dosage
,
prove
the
concept
of
selective
COX-2
inhibition
to
avoid
the
NSAID
typical
side
effects
.

Newly
developed
drugs
with
a
very
high
selectivity
for
COX-2
are
now
tested
in
clinical
trials
.

CONCLUSION
:
So
far
the
results
suggest
,
that
selective
and
highly
selective
COX-2
inhibitors
have
significantly
fewer
gastrointestinal
and
renal
adverse
effects
and
do
not
inhibit
platelet
aggregation
.

Risk
factors
have
not
been
identified
that
determine
susceptibility
for
development
of
diisocyanate-induced
occupational
asthma
(
DA
)
.

We
hypothesized
that
diisocyanate
(
DI
)
exposure
could
modify
gene
promoter
regions
regulating
transcription
of
cytokine
mediators
and
thereby
influence
expression
of
DA
.

A
cross-sectional
study
was
designed
to
investigate
the
promoter
methylation
status
of
candidate
genes
in
DI-exposed
workers
.

Subjects
consisted
of
131
workers
in
three
groups
:
40
cases
with
DA
confirmed
by
a
positive

challenge
(

)
(

)
,
41
exposed
workers
with
lower
respiratory
symptoms
and
negative
SIC
(
DA-
)
,
and
50
asymptomatic
exposed
workers
(
AWs
)
.

We
studied
four
candidate
genes
(
GSTM1
,
DUSP22
,
IFN-γ
,
and
IL-4
)
for
which
altered
promoter
methylation
has
been
previously
investigated
for
relationships
with
a
variety
of
other
environmental
exposures
.

Methylation
status
was
determined
using
methylation-specific
quantitative
PCR
performed
on
genomic
DNA
extracted
from
whole
blood
.

Results
showed
that
relative
methylation
of
IFN-γ
promoter
was
significantly
increased
in
DA
+
in
comparison
with
both
comparator
groups
(
DA-
and
AW
)
,
and
it
exhibited
good
sensitivity
(
77
.
5%
)
and
specificity
(
80%
)
for
identifying
DA
workers
in
a
multivariate
predictive
model
after
adjusting
for
type
of
DI
exposure
,
smoking
status
,
methacholine
PC20
,
and
gender
.

IL-4
promoter
was
slightly
less
methylated
only
in
DA
+
compared
with
AW
among
nonsmoking
workers
.

Both
GSTM1
and
DUSP22
promoter
methylations
were
found
not
associated
with
DA
.

Our
finding
suggests
that
exposure
to
occupational
chemicals
could
play
a
heretofore
undefined
mechanistic
role
via
epigenetic
modification
of
specific
genes
in
the

Emodin-6-O-β-D-glucoside
(
EG
)
is
a
new
active
compound
from
Reynoutria
japonica
,
and
its
biologic
activities
have
not
been
previously
investigated
.

In
this
study
,
we
first
investigated
the
antiinflammatory
activities
of
EG
on
HMGB1-mediated
proinflammatory
responses
in
human
umbilical
vein
endothelial
cells
(
HUVECs
)
and
in
a
murine
cecal
ligation
and
puncture
(
CLP
)
-model
of
sepsis
in
mice
.

EG
was
found
to
suppress
the
release
of
HMGB1
,
the
production
of
tumor
necrosis
factor
(
TNF
)
-α
,
and
the
activation
of
nuclear
factor-κB
(
NF-κB
)
by
HMGB1
in
HUVECs
,
and
to
inhibit
HMGB1-mediated
hyperpermeability
and
leukocyte
migration
in
mice
.

In
the
CLP
model
,
HMGB1
was
highly
released
,
but
this
release
was
prevented
by
EG
.

Furthermore
,
EG
also
increased
the
survival
times
of
CLP
administered
mice
.

Collectively
,
this
study
shows
EG
can
protect
barrier
integrity
and
inhibit
HMGB1-mediated
inflammatory
responses
,
which
suggests
a
potential
use
as
a
therapy
for

Retinoic
acid
biosynthesis
in
vertebrates
occurs
in
two
consecutive
steps
:
the
oxidation
of
retinol
to
retinaldehyde
followed
by
the
oxidation
of
retinaldehyde
to
retinoic
acid
.

Enzymes
of
the
MDR
(
medium-chain
dehydrogenase
/
reductase
)
,
SDR
(
short-chain
dehydrogenase
/
reductase
)
and
AKR
(
aldo-keto
reductase
)
superfamilies
have
been
reported
to
catalyse
the
conversion
between
retinol
and
retinaldehyde
.

Estimation
of
the
relative
contribution
of
enzymes
of
each
type
was
difficult
since
kinetics
were
performed
with
different
methodologies
,
but
SDRs
would
supposedly
play
a
major
role
because
of
their
low
K
(
m
)
values
,
and
because
they
were
found
to
be
active
with
retinol
bound
to
CRBPI
(
cellular
retinol
binding
protein
type
I
)
.

In
the
present
study
we
employed
detergent-free
assays
and
HPLC-based
methodology
to
characterize
side-by-side
the
retinoid-converting
activities
of
human
MDR
[
ADH
(
alcohol
dehydrogenase
)
1B2
and
ADH4
)
,
SDR
(
RoDH
(
retinol
dehydrogenase
)
-4
and
RDH11
]
and
AKR
(
AKR1B1
and
AKR1B10
)
enzymes
.

Our
results
demonstrate
that
none
of
the
enzymes
,
including
the
SDR
members
,
are
active
with
CRBPI-bound
retinoids
,
which
questions
the
previously
suggested
role
of
CRBPI
as
a
retinol
supplier
in
the
retinoic
acid
synthesis
pathway
.

The
members
of
all
three
superfamilies
exhibit
similar
and
low
K
(
m
)
values
for
retinoids
(
0
.
12-1
.
1
microM
)
,
whilst
they
strongly
differ
in
their
kcat
values
,
which
range
from
0
.
35
min
(
-1
)
for
AKR1B1
to
302
min
(
-1
)
for
ADH4
.

ADHs
appear
to
be
more
effective
retinol
dehydrogenases
than
SDRs
because
of
their
higher
kcat
values
,
whereas
RDH11
and
AKR1B10
are
efficient
retinaldehyde
reductases
.

Cell
culture
studies
support
a
role
for
RoDH-4
as
a
retinol
dehydrogenase
and
for
AKR1B1
as
a
retinaldehyde
reductase
in
vivo
.
Berberine
is
an
isoquinoline
alkaloid
that
has
drawn
extensive
attention
since
it
possesses
various
biological
activities
.

Several
mechanisms
have
been
proposed
to
interpret
the
anticancer
activity
of
berberine
.

However
,
these
explanations
are
mostly
based
on
its
downstream-regulated
genes
or
proteins
,
information
on
the
direct
target
proteins
that
mediate
the
antiproliferative
action
of
berberine
remain
unclear
.

In
the
present
study
,
a
computational
pipeline
based
on
a
ligand-protein
inverse
docking
program
and
mining
of
the
"Connectivity
MAP"
data
was
adopted
to
explore
the
potential
target
proteins
for
berberine
.

The
results
showed
that
four
proteins
,
i
.

e
.

,
calmodulin
,
cytochrome
P450
3A4
,
sex
hormone-binding
globulin
and
carbonic
anhydrase
II
,
were
suggested
to
be
the
potential
targets
of
berberine
.

The
anti-calmodulin
property
of
berberine
was
demonstrated
with
an
in
vitro
phosphodiesterase
activity
assay
.

Flow
cytometric
analysis
found
that
G1
cell
cycle
arrest
induced
by
berberine
in
Bel7402
cells
was
enhanced
by
cotreatment
with
calmodulin
inhibitors
.

Western
blotting
results
indicated
that
berberine
treatment
decreased
phosphorylation
of
calmodulin
kinase
II
and
blocked
subsequent
MEK1
activation
as
well
as
p27
protein
degradation
.

These
results
suggested
that
calmodulin
might
play
crucial
roles
in
berberine-induced
cell
cycle
arrest
in
cancer
cells

The
thalamic
paraventricular
nucleus
(
PVT
)
,
reported
to
participate
in
arousal
and
motivated
behaviors
,
contains
abundant
receptors
for
thyrotropin-releasing
hormone
(
TRH
)
,
a
neuropeptide
also
known
to
modulate
arousal
and
mood
.

To
test
the
hypothesis
that
TRH
could
influence
the
excitability
of
PVT
neurons
,
whole
call
patch
clamp
recordings
obtained
in
rat
brain
slice
preparations
were
evaluated
during
bath
applied
TRH
.

In
the
majority
of
neurons
tested
,
TRH
induced
reversible
TTX-resistant
membrane
depolarization
.

Under
voltage-clamp
,
TRH
induced
a
concentration-dependent
G
protein-
mediated
inward
current
.

The
mean
net
TRH-induced
current
exhibited
a
decrease
in
membrane
conductance
.

Further
analyses
identified
two
concurrent
conductances
contributing
to
the
TRH-induced
response
.

One
conductance
featured
a
Na
(

)
-independent
and
K
(
+
)
-dependent
net
current
that
displayed
rectification
and
was
suppressed
by

concentrations
of
Ba
(

and
two
GIRK

The
second
conductance
featured
a
Na
(

-dependent
net
inward
current
with
an
I-V
relationship
that
exhibited
double
rectification
with
a
negative
slope
conductance
below
-40
mV
.

This
conductance
was
suppressed
by
nonselective
TRPC
channel
blockers
2-APB
,
flufenamic
acid
and
ML204
,
enhanced
by
La
(
3
+
)
in
a
subpopulation
of
cells
,
and
unchanged
by
the
TRPV1
antagonist
capsazepine
or
a
Na
(
+
)
/
Ca
(
2
+
)
exchanger
blocker
KB-R7943
.

TRH
also
enhanced
hyperpolarization-activated
low
threshold
spikes
,
a
feature
that
was
sensitive
to
pretreatment
with
either
2-APB
or
ML204
.

Collectively
,
the
data
imply
that
TRH
enhances
excitability
in
PVT
neurons
via
concurrently
decreasing
a
G-protein-gated
inwardly
rectifying
K
(
+
)
conductance
and
activating
a
cationic
conductance
with
characteristics
reminiscent
of
TRPC-like
channels
,
possibly
involving
TRPC4
/
C5
subunits
.
AIM
:
To
determine
the
role
of
endothelium-derived
contracting
factor
(
EDCF
)
in
the
response
to
endothelin-1
in
arteries
with
regenerated
endothelium
.

METHODS
:
Rings
of
porcine
coronary
arteries
,
with
and
without
endothelium
of
previously
deendothelialized
left
anterior
descending
coronary
arteries
and
native
left
circumflex
coronary
arteries
,
were
suspended
in
conventional
organ
chambers
for
the
measurement
of
isometric
force
.

RESULTS
:
In
quiescent
rings
of
the
previously
deendothelialized
left
anterior
descending
coronary
artery
treated
with
the
NO-synthase
inhibitor
nitro-L-arginine
,
endothelin-1
caused
contractions
which
were
larger
in
rings
with
than
that
in
those
without
endothelium
.

Under
the
same
experimental
conditions
,
in
the
left
circumflex
coronary
artery
,
the
contractions
to
endothelin-1
were
augmented
markedly
by
the
removal
of
the
endothelium
.

In
rings
with
endothelium
of
the
previously
deendothelialized
left
anterior
descending
coronary
artery
,
indometacin
(
inhibitor
of
cyclooxygenase
)
and
ridogrel
(
thromboxane
A2
receptor
antagonist
and
inhibitor
of
thromboxane
synthase
)
inhibited
contractions
to
endothelin-1
.

Dazoxiben
(
inhibitor
of
thromboxane
synthase
)
inhibited
,
to
the
same
extent
as
indometacin
and
ridogel
,
the
response
to
higher
concentrations
of
endothelin-1
.

The
endothelium-dependent
component
of
the
response
to
lower
concentrations
of
endothelin-1
was
inhibited
by
indometacin
and
ridogrel
,
but
not
by
dazoxiben
.

In
rings
without
endothelium
of
both
previously
deendothelialized
left
anterior
descending
and
native
left
circumflex
coronary
arteries
,
indometacin
and
ridogrel
did
not
affect
the
contractions
to
endothelin-1
.

CONCLUSION
:
These
findings
suggest
that
in
regenerated
endothelium
,
high
concentrations
of
endothelin-1
stimulate
the
release
of
thromboxane
A2
.

Endoperoxides
generated
by
activation
of
endothelial
cyclooxygenase
may
be
the
endothelium-derived
contracting
factor
(
s
)
released
in
regenerated
endothelium
by
lower
concentrations
of
the
peptide
.

The
present
series
of
studies
is
the
first
to
investigate
the
pharmacological
mechanisms
underlying
d-fenfluramine-
and
d-norfenfluramine-induced
hypophagia
in
the
rat
using
highly
selective
serotonin
5-HT2
receptor
antagonists
.

Administration
of
d-fenfluramine
,
and
its
major
metabolite
d-norfenfluramine
,
suppresses
food
intake
in
animals
.

Both
compounds
stimulate
the
release
of
serotonin
and
are
potent
inhibitors
of
the
re-uptake
of
5-HT
into
nerve
terminals
.

In
addition
,
d-norfenfluramine
also
acts
as
a
direct
5-HT
(
2B
/
2C
)
receptor
agonist
.

Pre-treatment
with
the
selective
5-HT2C
receptor
antagonist
,
SB-242084
(
0
.
3-3
mg
/
kg
)
,
dose-dependently
inhibited
both
d-fenfluramine-
(
3
mg
/
kg
)
and
d-norfenfluramine-induced
(
2
mg
/
kg
)
hypophagia
.

In
contrast
,
the
hypophagic
effect
of
d-fenfluramine
and
d-norfenfluramine
was
unaffected
by
prior
treatment
with
the
highly
selective
5-HT2B
receptor
antagonists
,
SB-215505
(
0
.
3-3
mg
/
kg
)
and
RS-127445
(
1-3
mg
/
kg
)
or
the
5-HT2A
receptor
antagonists
MDL
100
,
907
(
0
.
003-0
.
03
mg
/
kg
)
and
ketanserin
(
0
.
2
,
0
.
5
mg
/
kg
)
.

In
addition
,
the
5-HT1A
receptor
antagonist
WAY-100635
(
0
.
3
,
1
mg
/
kg
)
and
the
5-HT1B
receptor
antagonists
GR-127935
(
1
,
2
mg
/
kg
)
and
SB-224289
(
2-10
mg
/
kg
)
did
not
affect
d-fenfluramine-induced
hypophagia
.

These
data
provide
unequivocal
evidence
for
an
important
role
of
the
5-HT2C
receptor
in
the
mediation
of
d-fenfluramine
and
d-norfenfluramine-induced
hypophagia
in
the
rat
and
do
not
support
the
involvement
of
5-HT1A

BACKGROUND
:
Folate
metabolism
pathway
genes
have
been
examined
for
association
with
neural
tube
defects
(
NTDs
)
because
folic
acid
supplementation
reduces
the
risk
of
this
debilitating
birth
defect
.

Most
studies
addressed
these
genes
individually
,
often
with
different
populations
providing
conflicting
results
.

OBJECTIVES
:
Our
study
evaluates
several
folate
pathway
genes
for
association
with
human
NTDs
,
incorporating
an
environmental
cofactor
:
maternal
folate
supplementation
.

METHODS
:
In
304
Caucasian
American
NTD
families
with
myelomeningocele
or
anencephaly
,
we
examined
28
polymorphisms
in
11
genes
:
folate
receptor
1
,
folate
receptor
2
,
solute
carrier
family
19
member
1
,
transcobalamin
II
,
methylenetetrahydrofolate
dehydrogenase
1
,
serine
hydroxymethyl-transferase
1
,
5
,
10-methylenetetrahydrofolate
reductase
(
MTHFR
)
,
5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homo-cysteine
methyltransferase
,
5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine
methyltransferase
reductase
,
betaine-homocysteine
methyltransferase
(
BHMT
)
,
and
cystathionine-beta-synthase
.

RESULTS
:
Only
single
nucleotide
polymorphisms
(
SNPs
)
in
BHMT
were
significantly
associated
in
the
overall
data
set;
this
significance
was
strongest
when
mothers
took
folate-containing
nutritional
supplements
before
conception
.

The
BHMT
SNP
rs3733890
was
more
significant
when
the
data
were
stratified
by
preferential
transmission
of
the
MTHFR
rs1801133
thermolabile
T
allele
from
parent
to
offspring
.

Other
SNPs
in
folate
pathway
genes
were
marginally
significant
in
some
analyses
when
stratified
by
maternal
supplementation
,
MTHFR
,
or
BHMT
allele
transmission
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
BHMT
rs3733890
is
significantly
associated
in
our
data
set
,
whereas
MTHFR
rs1801133
is
not
a
major
risk
factor
.

Further
investigation
of
folate
and
methionine
cycle
genes
will
require
extensive
SNP
genotyping
and
/
or
resequencing
to
identify
novel
variants
,
inclusion
of
environmental
factors
,
and
investigation
of
gene-gene
interactions
in
large
data
sets
.
Six
new
sesquiterpenoids
,
aristoyunnolins
A-F
(
1-6
)
,
an
artifact
of
isolation
[
7-O-ethyl
madolin
W
(
7
)
]
,
and
12
known
analogues
were
isolated
from
stems
of
Aristolochia
yunnanensis
.

The
structures
were
determined
by
combined
chemical
and
spectral
methods
,
and
the
absolute
configurations
of
compounds
2
,
3
,
5-7
,
9
,
14
,
and
17
were
determined
by
the
modified
Mosher's
method
and
CD
analysis
.

Compounds
1-19
were
screened
using
a
bioassay
system
designed
to
evaluate
the
effect
on
mitogen-activated
protein
kinases
(
MAPKs
)
signaling
pathways
.

Among
three
MAPKs
(
ERK1
/
2
,
JNK
,
and
p38
)
,
compounds
1
,
4
,
10-13
,
16
,
18
,
and
19
exhibited
selective
inhibition
of
the
phosphorylation
of
ERK1
/
2
.

Compounds
16
and
19
were
more
active
than
the
positive
control
PD98059
,
a
known
inhibitor
of
the
ERK1
/
2
signaling
pathway
.
As
a
therapeutic
or
chemopreventative
agent
for
various
cancers
,
all-trans
retinoic
acid
(
atRA
)
has
been
reported
to
inhibit
growth
,
induce
apoptosis
or
cause
differentiation
.

It
was
found
that
atRA
could
protect
hepatocellular
carcinoma
(
HCC
)
cells
against
cell
death
induced
by
serum
starvation
.

Furthermore
,
it
was
found
that
atRA
could
enhance
cell
adhesion
,
but
had
no
effect
on
the
cell
cycle
and
apoptosis
.

Using
an
Illumina
Human
HT-12
v4
expression
microarray
,
207
upregulated
and
173
downregulated
genes
were
identified
in
HepG2
cells
treated
with
atRA
.

The
most
upregulated
genes
are
cytochrome
P450
family
26
subfamily
A
polypeptide
1
(
CYP26A1
)
,
histidine
triad
nucleotide
binding
protein
3
(
HINT3
)
,
miR-1282
and
cytochrome
P450
family
26
subfamily
B
polypeptide
1
(
CYP26B1
)
,
which
showed
more
than
fivefold
greater
expression
.

Using
Gene
Ontology
analysis
,
the
greatest
significance
was
found
in
extracellular-matrix-related
molecular
functions
and
the
cellular
component
in
upregulated
genes
.

The
upregulation
of
collagen
8A2
(
COL8A2
)
was
further
confirmed
using
quantitative
RT-PCR
and
western
blotting
.

Knockdown
of
COL8A2
blocked
enhancement
in
the
early
stage
of
cell
adhesion
by
atRA
treatment
.

Re-expression
of
COL8A2
in
COL8A2-knocked-down
HCC
cells
reversed
the
effect
of
small
interfering
RNA-COL8A2
.

In
addition
,
COL8A2
could
increase
HCC
cell
migration
and
invasion
.

Thus
,
COL8A2
was
identified
as
the
key
protein
involved
in
the
enhancement
of
cell
adhesion
of
atRA
under
serum-free
conditions
.

In
conclusion
,
atRA
protects
HCC
cells
against
serum-starvation-induced
cell
death
by
enhancing
cell
adhesion
,
and
COL8A2
plays
an
important
role
in
HCC
cell
migration
and
invasion
.
High

The
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
investigate
the
anti-fibrotic
effects
of
the
aqueous
extract
of
the
Platycodi
Radix
root
(
Changkil
:
CK
)
on
dimethylnitrosamine
(
DMN
)
-induced
liver
fibrosis
in
rats
.

DMN
treatment
for
4weeks
led
to
marked
liver
fibrosis
as
assessed
by
serum
biochemistry
,
histopathological
examination
,
and
hepatic
lipid
peroxidation
and
collagen
content
.

CK
significantly
inhibited
DMN-induced
increases
in
serum
alanine
aminotransferase
(
ALT
)
and
aspartate
aminotransferase
(
AST
)
activities
,
fibrosis
score
,
and
hepatic
malondialdehyde
and
collagen
content
.

CK
also
inhibited
DMN-induced
reductions
in
rat
body
and
liver
weights
.

Reverse
transcription
polymerase
chain
reaction
(
RT-PCR
)
and
western
blot
analyses
revealed
that
CK
inhibited
DMN-induced
increases
in
matrix
metalloproteinase-13
(
MMP-13
)
,
tissue
inhibitor
of
metalloproteinase-1
(
TIMP-1
)
,
and
tumor
necrosis
factor-α
(
TNF-α
)
mRNA
,
and
collagen
type
I
and
α-smooth
muscle
actin
protein
.

DMN-induced
cyclooxygenase-2
(
COX-2
)
expression
and
nuclear
factor-kappa
B
(
NF-κB
)
activation
was
reduced
by
CK
treatment
.

Furthermore
,
CK
induced
activation
of
nuclear
erythroid
2-related
factor
2
(
Nrf2
)
-mediated
antioxidant
enzymes
such
as
γ-glutamylcysteine
synthetase
(
γ-GCS
)
,
heme
oxygenase-1
(
HO-1
)
,
NAD
(
P
)
H
quinone
oxidoreductase
1
(
NQO1
)
,
and
glutathione-S-transferase
(
GST
)
in
HepG2
cells
.

These
results
demonstrated
that
CK
attenuates
DMN-induced
liver
fibrosis
through
the
activation
of
Nrf2-mediated
antioxidant
enzymes
.

In

assessed
the

study
investigated
the
effect

GSK1292263
(

)
on
the
pharmacokinetic
profile
of
simvastatin
(
40

,
which
is
consistent
with
an
inhibitory

on
intestinal
BCRP
and
CYP3A4
.

In
contrast
,
GSK1292263
did
not
inhibit

on
the
lack
of

OBJECTIVE
:
Celecoxib
and
rofecoxib
are
two
relatively
new
nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory
drugs
(
NSAIDs
)
that
selectively
inhibit
the
cyclo-oxygenase-2
(
COX-2
)
isoenzyme
at
therapeutic
concentrations
.

The
nephrotoxic
potential
of
selective
COX-2
inhibitors
has
not
been
clearly
established
.

This
study
was
conducted
in
order
to
understand
the
association
between
acute
renal
failure
and
the
two
COX-2
inhibitors
celecoxib
and
rofecoxib
.

METHODS
:
A
search
was
performed
in
the
US
Food
and
Drug
Administration's
(
FDA
)
Adverse
Event
Reporting
System
(
AERS
)
to
identify
cases
of
renal
failure
submitted
to
the
FDA
.

A
MEDLINE
search
of
the
English
language
literature
was
also
performed
to
identify
published
cases
of
renal
failure
associated
with
celecoxib
and
rofecoxib
.

RESULTS
:
One
hundred
twenty-two
and
142
domestic
US
cases
of
celecoxib
and
rofecoxib-associated
renal
failure
,
respectively
,
were
identified
in
the
AERS
database
.

The
literature
search
identified
19
cases
of
acute
renal
impairment
in
association
with
celecoxib
and
rofecoxib
.

In
addition
,
drug
regulatory
authorities
in
the
UK
,
Canada
,
and
Australia
have
received
about
50
reports
of
renal
failure
with
celecoxib
and
rofecoxib
.

Descriptive
statistics
of
the
AERS
cases
have
been
summarised
in
this
report
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
Data
from
AERS
and
published
case
reports
suggest
that
use
of
both
these
drugs
is
associated
with
renal
effects
similar
to
that
of
conventional
nonselective
NSAIDs
.

Physicians
should
be
aware
that
serious
or
life-threatening
renal
failure
has
been
reported
in
patients
with
normal
or
impaired
renal
function
after
short-term
therapy
with
celecoxib
and
rofecoxib
.

Patients
at
greatest
risk
for
renal
injury
are
those
with
pre-existing
renal
impairment
,
heart
failure
,
liver
dysfunction
,
those
taking
diuretics
and
/
or
ACE
inhibitors
,
and
the
elderly
.

Kidney
function
should
be
monitored
closely
for
any
signs
of
potential
renal
injuries
soon
after
initiating
treatment
with
these
agents
,
especially
in
high-risk

In
addition
to
its
well
known
sedative
and
teratogenic
effects
,
thalidomide
also
possesses
potent
immunomodulatory
and
antiinflammatory
activities
,
being
most
effective
against
leprosy
and
chronic
graft-versus-host
disease
.

The
immunomodulatory
activity
of
thalidomide
has
been
ascribed
to
the
selective
inhibition
of
tumor
necrosis
factor
alpha
from
monocytes
.

The
molecular
mechanism
for
the
immunomodulatory
effect
of
thalidomide
remains
unknown
.

To
elucidate
this
mechanism
,
we
synthesized
an
active
photoaffinity
label
of
thalidomide
as
a
probe
to
identify
the
molecular
target
of
the
drug
.

Using
the
probe
,
we
specifically
labeled
a
pair
of
proteins
of
43-45
kDa
with
high
acidity
from
bovine
thymus
extract
.

Purification
of
these
proteins
and
partial
peptide
sequence
determination
revealed
them
to
be
alpha1-acid
glycoprotein
(
AGP
)
.

We
show
that
the
binding
of
thalidomide
photoaffinity
label
to
authentic
human
AGP
is
competed
with
both
thalidomide
and
the
nonradioactive
photoaffinity
label
at
concentrations
comparable
to
those
required
for
inhibition
of
production
of
tumor
necrosis
factor
alpha
from
human
monocytes
,
suggesting
that
AGP
may
be
involved
in
the
immunomodulatory
activity
of
thalidomide
.
Prostacyclin
and
its
mimetics
are
used
therapeutically
for
the
treatment
of
pulmonary
hypertension
.

These
drugs
act
via
cell
surface
prostacyclin
receptors
(
IP
receptors
)
;
however
,
some
of
them
can
also
activate
the
nuclear
receptor
peroxisome
proliferator-activated
receptor
beta
(
PPARbeta
)
.

We
examined
the
possibility
that
PPARbeta
is
a
therapeutic
target
for
the
treatment
of
pulmonary
hypertension
.

Using
the
newly
approved
(
for
pulmonary
hypertension
)
prostacyclin
mimetic
treprostinil
sodium
,
reporter
gene
assays
for
PPARbeta
activation
and
measurement
of
lung
fibroblast
proliferation
were
analyzed
.

Treprostinil
sodium
was
found
to
activate
PPARbeta
in
reporter
gene
assays
and
to
inhibit
proliferation
of
human
lung
fibroblasts
at
concentrations
consistent
with
an
effect
on
PPARs
but
not
on
IP
receptors
.

The
effects
of
treprostinil
sodium
on
human
lung
cell
proliferation
are
mimicked
by
those
of
the
highly
selective
PPARbeta
ligand
GW0742
.

There
are
no
receptor
antagonists
for
PPARbeta
or
for
IP
receptors
,
but
by
using
lung
fibroblasts
cultured
from
mice
lacking
PPARbeta
(
PPARbeta-
/
-
)
or
IP
(
IP-
/
-
)
,
we
demonstrate
that
the
antiproliferative
effects
of
treprostinil
sodium
are
mediated
by
PPARbeta
and
not
IP
in
lung
fibroblasts
.

These
observations
suggest
that
some
of
the
local
,
longer-term
benefits
of
treprostinil
sodium
on
reducing
the
remodeling
associated
with
pulmonary
hypertension
may
be
mediated
by
PPARbeta
.

This
study
is
the
first
to
identify
PPARbeta
as
a
potential
therapeutic
target
for
the
treatment
of
pulmonary
hypertension
,
which
is
important
because
orally
active
PPARbeta
ligands
have
been
developed
for
the
treatment
of
dyslipidemia
.

Adipocyte
fatty

(
AFABP
,
also
known
as
aP2
and
FABP4
)
has
recently
been
introduced
as
a
novel
fat-derived
circulating
protein
.

AFABP
serum
concentrations
are
positively
correlated
with
markers
of
the
metabolic
syndrome
and
vascular
disease
in
various
cross-sectional
and
interventional
studies
.

Furthermore
,
a
small
set
of
prospective
studies
indicates
that
high
AFABP
serum
levels
at
baseline
predict
the
risk
for
metabolic
and
vascular
morbidity
and
mortality
.

Studies
in
Afabp
(
also
known
as
Fabp4
)
knockout
mice
and
AFABP
inhibitor-treated
animals
suggest
that
total
AFABP
promotes
insulin
resistance
,
hypertriacylglycerolaemia
and
atherosclerosis
by
ligand
/
ligand
delivery
,
as
well
as
ligand-independent
mechanisms
.

In
contrast
,
the
pathophysiological
significance
of
circulating
AFABP
and
the
mechanisms
leading
to
its
release
remain
to
be
established
.

The
current
review
summarises
recent
findings
on
the
regulation
and

BACKGROUND
:
A
mutation
in
the
cardiac
sodium
channel
gene
(
SCN5A
)
has
been
described
in
patients
with
the
syndrome
of
right
bundle
branch
block
,
ST-segment
elevation
in
leads
V1
to
V3
,
and
sudden
death
(
Brugada
syndrome
)
.

These
electrocardiographic
manifestations
are
transient
in
many
patients
with
the
syndrome
.

The
present
study
examined
arrhythmic
risk
in
patients
with
overt
and
concealed
forms
of
the
disease
and
the
effectiveness
of
sodium
channel
blockers
to
unmask
the
syndrome
and
,
thus
,
identify
patients
at
risk
.

METHODS
AND
RESULTS
:
The
effect
of
intravenous
ajmaline
(
1
mg
/
kg
)
,
procainamide
(
10
mg
/
kg
)
,
or
flecainide
(
2
mg
/
kg
)
on
the
ECG
was
studied
in
34
patients
with
the
syndrome
and
transient
normalization
of
the
ECG
(
group
A
)
,
11
members
of
3
families
in
whom
a
SCN5A
mutation
was
associated
with
the
syndrome
and
8
members
in
whom
it
was
not
(
group
B
)
,
and
53
control
subjects
(
group
C
)
.

Ajmaline
,
procainamide
,
or
flecainide
administration
resulted
in
ST-segment
elevation
and
right
bundle
branch
block
in
all
patients
in
group
A
and
in
all
11
patients
with
the
mutation
in
group
B
.

A
similar
pattern
could
not
be
elicited
in
the
8
patients
in
group
B
who
lacked
the
mutation
or
in
any
person
in
group
C
.

The
follow-up
period
(
37
+
/
-33
months
)
revealed
no
differences
in
the
incidence
of
arrhythmia
between
the
34
patients
in
whom
the
phenotypic
manifestation
of
the
syndrome
was
transient
and
the
24
patients
in
whom
it
was
persistent
(
log-rank
,
0
.
639
)
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
The
data
demonstrated
a
similar
incidence
of
potentially
lethal
arrhythmias
in
patients
displaying
transient
versus
persistent
ST-segment
elevation
and
right
bundle
branch
block
,
as
well
as
the
effectiveness
of
sodium
channel
blockers
to
unmask
the
syndrome
and
,
thus
,
identify
patients
at
risk
.
Soy
isoflavonoids
have
many
useful
properties
.

However
,
they
are
metabolized
in
vivo
,
including
in
humans
.

The
effect
of
the
metabolism
of
soy
isoflavonoids
on
their
properties
is
not
fully
understood
.

We
have
isolated
the
bacterial
strain
SY8519
,
which
has
been
shown
to
metabolize
daidzein
to
O-desmethylangolensin
and
to
produce
2-
(
4-hydroxyphenyl
)
propionic
acid
from
genistein
.

According
to
chiral
HPLC
analysis
,
the
2-
(
4-hydroxyphenyl
)
propionic
acid
obtained
from
the
bacterium
was
optically
active
.

To
determine
the
absolute
stereochemistry
of
the
microbial
product
,
we
prepared
(
S
)
-2-
(
4-hydroxyphenyl
)
propionic
acid
from
(
S
)
-2-phenylpropionic
and
concluded
that
the
microbial
product
had
an
R-configuration
by
chiral
HPLC
analysis
.

We
also
applied
the
metabolite
to
mouse
adipocytes
and
found
that
2-HPPA
was
less
effective
at
reducing
leptin
secretion
than
the
parent
compound
genistein
.

Our
results
suggested
that
'O-desmethylangolensin-production'
attenuates
the
effect
of
soy
isoflavonoids
by
reducing
not
only
the
activity
of
daidzein
but
also
that
of
genistein
.
Heterologous
expression
of
ligand-gated
ion
channels
(
LGICs
)
in
Xenopus
laevis
oocytes
combined
with
site-directed
mutagenesis
has
been
demonstrated
to
be
a
powerful
approach
to
study
structure-function
relationships
.

In
particular
,
introducing
unnatural
amino
acids
(
UAAs
)
has
enabled
modifications
that
are
not
found
in
natural
proteins
.

However
,
the
current
strategy
relies
on
the
technically
demanding
in
vitro
synthesis
of
aminoacylated
suppressor
tRNA
.

We
report
here
a
general
method
that
circumvents
this
limitation
by
utilizing
orthogonal
aminoacyl-tRNA
synthetase
(
aaRS
)
/
suppressor
tRNA
(
CUA
)
pairs
to
genetically
encode
UAAs
in
Xenopus
oocytes
.

We
show
that
UAAs
inserted
in
the
N-terminal
domain
of
N-methyl-D-aspartate
receptors
(
NMDARs
)
serve
as
photo-crosslinkers
that
lock
the
receptor
in
a
discrete
conformational
state
in
response
to
UV
photo
treatment
.

Our
method
should
be
generally
applicable
to
studies
of
other
LGICs
in
Xenopus
oocytes
.
Attention
deficit
/
hyperactivity
disorder
(
ADHD
)
is
attributed
to
dysfunction
of
the
prefrontal
cortex
.

Methylphenidate
,
an
inhibitor
of
dopamine
and
norepinephrine
transporters
(
DAT
and
NET
,
respectively
)
,
is
a
standard
treatment
for
ADHD
.

The
Spontaneously
Hypertensive
Rat
(
SHR
)
is
a
well-established
animal
model
of
ADHD
.

Our
previous
results
showed
that
methylphenidate
treatment
in
adolescent
SHR
enhanced
cocaine
self-administration
during
adulthood
,
and
alterations
in
DAT
function
in
prefrontal
cortex
play
a
role
in
this
response
.

Importantly
,
prefrontal
cortex
subregions
,
orbitofrontal
cortex
(
OFC
)
and
medial
prefrontal
cortex
(
mPFC
)
,
have
been
shown
to
have
distinct
roles
in
ADHD
and
cocaine
self-administration
.

In
the
current
study
,
SHR
,
Wistar-Kyoto
(
WKY
)
and
Wistar
(
WIS
)
rats
received
a
therapeutically
relevant
dose
of
methylphenidate
(
1
.
5mg
/
kg
,
p
.

o
.

)
or
vehicle
during
adolescence
and
then
OFC
and
mPFC
DAT
function
and
cellular
expression
were
assessed
during
adulthood
.

In
both
OFC
and
mPFC
,
no
strain
differences
in
Vmax
or
Km
for
dopamine
uptake
into
synaptosomes
were
found
between
vehicle-treated
SHR
,
WKY
and
WIS
.

Methylphenidate
increased
DAT
Vmax
in
SHR
mPFC
and
decreased
DAT
Vmax
in
WKY
OFC
.

Also
,
methylphenidate
decreased
DAT
Km
in
WIS
OFC
.

Further
,
methylphenidate
did
not
alter
DAT
cellular
localization
,
indicating
that
methylphenidate
treatment
during
adolescence
regulated
DAT
function
in
SHR
mPFC
in
a
trafficking-independent
manner
.

Thus
,
the
increase
in
mPFC
DAT
function
was
an
SHR-specific
long
term
consequence
of
methylphenidate
treatment
during
adolescence
,
which
may
be
responsible
for
the
treatment-induced
alterations
in
behavior
including
the
observed
increases
in
cocaine
self-administration
.

A

was
used
to
generate
a

steps
to

with
an
overall

was
determined
using
a
combination
of

The

Reuptake

is

by
means
of
the

.

We
now
demonstrate
by
single-cell
RT-PCR
that
mRNA
of
the
organic
cation
transporter
3
(
OCT3
,
uptake

)
occurs
in
rat

as
well

Furthermore
,
our

analyses
reveal
the

of
mRNA
for
novel
organic

transporters
1
and
2
(
OCTN1

,
but
not
for

.

Making
use
of
the

,
we

The

was
enhanced

,

Two
observations
suggest
that
a
depletion
of

accounts
for
the

:
first
,
the

the

and
second
,

PURPOSE
:
To
determine
whether
the
temperature-sensitive
rat
retinal
pigment
epithelial
cell
line
(
RPE-J
)
express
mRNA
transcripts
for
apolipoprotein
(
apo
)
and
microsomal
triglyceride
transfer
protein
(
MTP
)
and
whether
it
can
synthesize
and
secrete
neutral
lipids
.

METHODS
:
RPE-J
cells
were
cultured
in
plastic
tissue
culture
flasks
and
on
Transwell
filters
.

RT-PCR
was
used
to
check
mRNA
expression
.

Phagocytosis
was
checked
by
adding
FITC-labeled
beads
and
measuring
the
intensity
of
the
fluorescence
.

Lipids
were
extracted
from
cultured
cells
that
were
fed
photoreceptor
outer
segments
(
OS
)
for
24h;
thin
layer
chromatography
and
enzymatic
fluorimetry
were
used
to
assay
lipid
content
.

Cells
were
supplemented
with
[
3H
]
-oleate
(
5000
dpm
/
nmole
)
bound
to
1
.
5%
fatty
acid
free
bovine
serum
albumin
in
order
to
permit
detection
of
the
new
synthesis
and
secretion
of
neutral
lipids
.

RESULTS
:
RPE-J
cells
express
mRNA
for
apoA-I
,
apoA-II
,
apoB
,
apoC-I
,
II
,
III
,
and
apo
E
,
as
well
as
MTP
.

RPE-J
cells
can
phagocytose
OS
and
beads
.

OS-fed
RPE-J
cells
,
relative
to
untreated
cells
,
have
5
.
8
times
more
triglyceride
,
2
.
6
times
more
phospholipid
,
1
.
5
times
more
unesterified

,
and
0
.
3
times
more
esterified

.

Radiolabeled
neutral
lipid
is
detected
in
cells
and
medium
.

All
lipids
increase
in
cells
with
time
but
only
phospholipid
increases
in
the
medium
with
time
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
RPE
cells
express
genes
encoding
apolipoproteins
and
MTP
.

Following
the
ingestion
of
OS
,
RPE-J
cells
contain
abundant
lipid
.

Following
the
ingestion
of
long-chain
fatty
acids
,
RPE-J
cells
can
synthesize
neutral
lipids
.

Future
experiments
will
determine
if
RPE-J
cells
secrete
lipoprotein
particles
containing
these
proteins
.
In
eukaryotes
,
L-carnitine
is
involved
in
energy
metabolism
by
facilitating
beta-oxidation
of
fatty
acids
.

Carnitine
acetyltransferases
(
CrAT
)
catalyze
the
reversible
conversion
of
acetyl-CoA
and
carnitine
to
acetylcarnitine
and
free
CoA
.

To
redesign
the
specificity
of
rat
CrAT
toward
its
substrates
,
we
mutated
Met564
.

The
M564G
mutated
CrAT
showed
higher
activity
toward
longer
chain
acyl-CoAs
:
activity
toward
myristoyl-CoA
was
1250-fold
higher
than
that
of
the
wild-type
CrAT
,
and
lower
activity
toward
its
natural
substrate
,
acetyl-CoA
.

Kinetic
constants
of
the
mutant
CrAT
showed
modification
in
favor
of
longer
acyl-CoAs
as
substrates
.

In
the
reverse
case
,
mutation
of
the
orthologous
glycine
(
Gly553
)
to
methionine
in
carnitine
octanoyltransferase
(
COT
)
decreased
activity
toward
its
natural
substrates
,
medium-
and
long-chain
acyl-CoAs
,
and
increased
activity
toward
short-chain
acyl-CoAs
.

Another
CrAT
mutant
,
M564A
,
was
prepared
and
tested
in
the
same
way
,
with
similar
results
.

We
conclude
that
Met564
blocks
the
entry
of
medium-
and
long-chain
acyl-CoAs
to
the
catalytic
site
of
CrAT
.

Three-dimensional
models
of
wild-type
and
mutated
CrAT
and
COT
support
this
hypothesis
.

We
show
for
the
first
time
that
a
single
amino
acid
is
able
to
determine
the
substrate
specificity
of
CrAT
and
COT
.

Coagulation
factor
IX
is
a
serine
protease
for
which
high-level
expression
of
biologically
active
protein
in
heterologous
cells
is
limited
due
to
inefficient
proteolytic
removal
of
the
propeptide
as
well
as
vitamin
K-dependent
carboxylation
of
multiple
amino-terminal
glutamic

residues
.

We
have
overexpressed
the
vitamin
K-dependent
gamma-carboxylase
cDNA
and
monitored
its
ability
to
improve
factor
IX
processing
in
Chinese
hamster
ovary
(
CHO
)
cells
.

From
amino
acid
sequence
analysis
of
bovine
liver
vitamin
K-dependent
gamma-carboxylase
,
degenerate
oligonucleotides
were
used
to
isolate
a
3
.
5-kbp
bovine
cDNA
that
encoded
a
758-residue
open
reading
frame
.

Expression
of
the
cDNA
in
COS-1
and
CHO
cells
yielded
17-
and
16-fold
increases
in
the
in
vitro
gamma-carboxylase
activity
of
microsomal
preparations
,
respectively
.

Anti-serum
raised
against
a
predicted
peptide
sequence
reacted
with
a
94-kDa
polypeptide
in
the
partially
purified
bovine
liver
preparation
as
well
as
in
stably
transfected
CHO
cells
.

The
amount
of
antibody
reactivity
correlated
with
the
increased
ability
to
carboxylate
a
peptide
substrate
in
vitro
.

These
results
strongly
support
the
conclusion
that
the
cDNA
encodes
the
vitamin
K-dependent
gamma-carboxylase
.

Transient
transfection
of
the
gamma-carboxylase
expression
vector
into
factor
IX-expressing
CHO
cells
did
not
improve
the
specific
procoagulant
activity
of
secreted
factor
IX
.

In
contrast
,
transfection
of
an
expression
vector
encoding
the
propeptide
processing
enzyme
PACE
(
paired
basic
amino
acid
cleaving
enzyme
)
did
improve
the
specific
activity
of
secreted
factor
IX
by
3-fold
.

These
results
demonstrate
that
the
ability
of
CHO
cells
to
modify
glutamic
acid
residues
to
gamma-carboxyglutamic
acid
in
secreted
factor
IX
is
not
limited
by
the
expression
of
the
vitamin
K-dependent
gamma-carboxylase
alone
.
OBJECTIVE
:
ADP
is
a
key
platelet
agonist
in
thromboembolism
.

One
of
the
receptors
involved
in
ADP-induced
platelet
activation
is
the
P2Y12
receptor
,
which
is
a
target
for
antithrombotic
drugs
.

METHODS
AND
RESULTS
:
Here
,
we
present
first
evidence
for
a
differential
role
of
this
receptor
in
thrombus
and
embolus
formation
in
vivo
.

Anesthetized
rabbits
were
treated
with
the
selective
P2Y12
antagonists
AR-C69931
MX
(
3
microg
x
kg
x
min
(
-1
)
IV
)
or
clopidogrel
(
25
mg
/
kg
orally
)
.

Efficacy
of
these
treatments
was
monitored
by
aggregation
and
thrombin
generation
measurements
in
blood
samples
ex
vivo
.

Mesenteric
arterioles
were
mechanically
injured;
thrombus
growth
and
subsequent
embolus
formation
were
visualized
by
real-time
intravital
microscopy
.

AR-C69931
MX
and
clopidogrel
significantly
(
P<0
.
05
)
reduced
the
total
duration
of
embolization
(
by
52%
and
36%
,
respectively
)
,
and
fewer
and
smaller
emboli
were
produced
.

The
size
of
the
initial
thrombus
was
significantly
reduced
(
P<0
.
005
)
,
but
its
stability
was
unaffected
:
plug
formation
was
still
effective
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
These
findings
demonstrate
that
ADP
and
its
P2Y12
receptor
are
involved
in
thrombus
growth
and
especially
in
the
formation
of
emboli
on
the
downstream
side
of
the
initial
thrombus
.

This
may
explain
the
beneficial
effects
of
P2Y12
receptor
antagonists

secondary
prevention
of
ischemic
events
in

L-2-hydroxyglutaric
aciduria
is
a
metabolic
disorder
in
which
L-2-hydroxyglutarate
accumulates
as
a
result
of
a
deficiency
in
FAD-linked
L-2-hydroxyglutarate
dehydrogenase
,
a
mitochondrial
enzyme
converting
L-2-hydroxyglutarate
to
alpha-ketoglutarate
.

The
origin
of
the
L-2-hydroxyglutarate
,
which
accumulates
in
this
disorder
,
is
presently
unknown
.

The
oxidation-reduction
potential
of
the
2-hydroxyglutarate
/
alpha-ketoglutarate
couple
is
such
that
L-2-hydroxyglutarate
could
potentially
be
produced
through
the
reduction
of
alpha-ketoglutarate
by
a
NAD-
or
NADP-linked
oxidoreductase
.

In
fractions
of
rat
liver
cytosolic
extracts
that
had
been
chromatographed
on
an
anion
exchanger
we
detected
an
enzyme
reducing
alpha-ketoglutarate
in
the
presence
of
NADH
.

This
enzyme
co-purified
with
cytosolic
L-malate
dehydrogenase
(
cMDH
)
upon
further
chromatography
on
Blue
Sepharose
.

Mitochondrial
fractions
also
contained
an
NADH-linked
,
'alpha-ketoglutarate
reductase'
,
which
similarly
co-purified
with
mitochondrial
L-malate
dehydrogenase
(
mMDH
)
.

Purified
mMDH
catalysed
the
reduction
of
alpha-ketoglutarate
to
L-2-hydroxyglutarate
with
a
catalytic
efficiency
that
was
about
10
(
7
)
-fold
lower
than
that
observed
with
oxaloacetate
.

For
the
cytosolic
enzyme
,
this
ratio
amounted
to
10
(
8
)
,
indicating
that
this
enzyme
is
more
specific
.

Both
cMDH
and
mMDH
are
highly
active
in
tissues
and
alpha-ketoglutarate
is
much
more
abundant
than
oxaloacetate
and
more
concentrated
in
mitochondria
than
in
the
cytosol
.

As
a
result
of
this
,
the
weak
activity
of
mMDH
on
alpha-ketoglutarate
is
sufficient
to
account
for
the
amount
of
L-2-hydroxyglutarate
that
is
excreted
by
patients
deficient
in
FAD-linked
L-2-hydroxyglutarate
dehydrogenase
.

The
latter
enzyme
appears
,
therefore
,
to
be
responsible
for
a
'metabolite
repair'
phenomenon
and
to
belong
to
the
expanding
class
of
'house-cleaning'
enzymes
.

S-adenosylmethionine
(
AdoMet
or
SAM
)
-dependent
methyltransferases
belong
to
a
large
and
diverse
family
of
group-transfer
enzymes
that
perform
vital
biological
functions
on
a
host
of
substrates
.

Despite
the
progress
in
genomics
,
structural
proteomics
,
and
computational
biology
,
functional
annotation
of
methyltransferases
remains
a
challenge
.

Herein
,
we
report
the
synthesis
and
activity
of
a
new
AdoMet
analogue
functionalized
with
a
ketone
group
.

Using
catechol
O-methyltransferase
(
COMT
,

.

.

.

)
and
thiopurine
S-methyltransferase
(
TPMT
,
EC
2
.
1
.

.
67
)
as
model
enzymes
,
this
robust
and
readily
accessible
analogue
displays
kinetic
parameters
that
are
comparable
to
AdoMet
and
exhibits
multiple
turnovers
with
enzyme
.

More
importantly
,
this
AdoMet
surrogate
displays
the
same
substrate
specificity
as
the
natural
methyl
donor
.

Incorporation
of
the
ketone
group
allows
for
subsequent
modification
via
bio-orthogonal
labeling
strategies
and
sensitive
detection
of
the
tagged
ketone
products
.

Hence
,
this
AdoMet
analogue
expands
the
toolbox
available
to
interrogate
the
biochemical
functions
of
methyltransferases
.
This
study
reports
the

,
the
brain

site
for
the
antiepileptic
drug
levetiracetam
(

)
,
and

N-dodecyl-beta-D-maltoside
(
DDM
)
was
the
best
detergent
at
achieving
a
high
percentage
of
SV2A
solubilization
and
at
maintaining
the
binding
characteristics
of
a
tritiated

of

more
potent
analogue

)
.

Scatchard
analysis
revealed
that
approximately
25%
of
SV2A
proteins
from
brain
membranes
are
solubilized
by
DDM
under
optimal
conditions
.

Competition
binding
experiments
with
a
variety
of
LEV
analogues
indicated
that
[
3H
]
ucb
30889
labels
the
same
binding
site
in
both
crude
homogenates
and
soluble
extracts
,
with
still
high
stereoselectivity
.

After
immunoprecipitation
of
SV2A
from
solubilized
rat
brain
membranes
,
binding
properties
of
[
3H
]
ucb
30889
to
SV2A
and
association
with
synaptotagmin
I
were
maintained
.

The
two
other
isoforms
SV2B
and
SV2C
were
found
to
be
co-immunoprecipitated
with
SV2A
.

The
solubilization
and
immunopurification
of
SV2A

of
m-chloro-phenylpiperazine
(

)
(
0
.
25
or

.
5
mg

)
induced
a
marked
and
dose-related
increase
in
extracellular
concentrations
of
serotonin
in
hippocampus
(
300-1
,
400%
of
baseline
)
as
measured
using
in
vivo
microdialysis
in
awake
male
Wistar
rats
of
the
spontaneously
hypertensive
(
SH
)
strain
.

Indicating
that
the
effect
of
mCPP
was
caused
by
a
reversal
of
the
serotonin
transporter
,
it
was
antagonized
by
pretreatment
with
the
serotonin
re-uptake
inhibitor
citalopram
(
10
mg
/
kg
)
but
was
unaffected
by
local
administration
of
the
sodium
channel
blocker
tetrodotoxin
(
TTX;
1
microns
)
.

mCPP
was
also
shown
to
induce
an
increase
in
extracellular
concentrations
of
dopamine
in
the
nucleus
accumbens
and
the
striatum
of
SH
rats
and
in
the
nucleus
accumbens
of
rats
of
the
Sprague-Dawley
(
SD
)
strain;
this
effect
of
mCPP
was
,
however
,
much
weaker
(
125-170%
of
baseline
)
than
the
effect
on
serotonin;
moreover
,
it
seems
to
be
TTX-sensitive
.

In
anesthetized
SD
rats
,
mCPP
induced
a
moderate
reduction
of
nigral
dopamine
cell
firing
rate;
supporting
the
assumption
that
this
effect
is
secondary
to
the
observed
increase
in
dopamine
release
,
it
was
blocked
by
pretreatment
either
with
the
dopamine
synthesis
inhibitor
alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine
or
with
the
dopamine
D2
receptor
antagonist
haloperidol
.

In
conclusion
,
the
results
suggest
that
mCPP
induces
a
marked
,
TTX-insensitive
increase
in
serotonin
release
in
rat
brain
,
but
only
a
modest
and
TTX-sensitive
increase
in
the
extracellular
levels
of
dopamine
.
Candesartan
is
an
angiotensin
II
type
1
receptor
blocker
(
ARB
)
that
has
been
to
shown
to
limit
ischemic
stroke
and
improve
stroke
outcome
.

In
experimental
stroke
,
candesartan
induces
a
proangiogenic
effect
that
is
partly
attributable
to
vascular
endothelial
growth
factor
.

Brain-derived
neurotrophic
factor
(
BDNF
)
is
a
member
of
the
neurotrophin
family
that
has
been
reported
to
have
angiogenic
effects
and
play
an
important
role
in
recovery
after
stroke
.

The
purpose
of
this
investigation
was
to
determine
the
role
of
BDNF
in
the
proangiogenic
effect
of
candesartan
in
the
brain
under
hypertensive
conditions
.

Accordingly
,
spontaneously
hypertensive
rats
were
treated
with
candesartan
,
and
brain
tissue
samples
were
collected
for
quantification
of
BDNF
expression
.

In
addition
,
human
cerebromicrovascular
endothelial
cells
were
treated
with
either
low-dose
(
1
ƒM
)
or
high-dose
(
1
µM
)
angiotensin
II
alone
or
in
combination
with
candesartan
(
0
.
16
µM
)
to
assess
the
effect
of
candesartan
treatment
and
BDNF
involvement
in
the
behavior
of
endothelial
cells
.

Candesartan
significantly
increased
the
expression
of
BDNF
in
the
SHR
(
P
<
0
.
05
)
.

In
addition
,
candesartan
reversed
the
antiangiogenic
effect
of

This

Although
several
treatment
options
are
available
to
reduce
hyperglycemia
,
only
about
half
of
individuals
with
diagnosed
diabetes
mellitus
(
DM
)
achieve
recommended
glycemic
targets
.

New
agents
that
reduce
blood
glucose
concentrations
by
novel
mechanisms
and
have
acceptable
safety
profiles
are
needed
to
improve
glycemic
control
and
reduce
the
complications
associated
with
type
2
diabetes
mellitus
(
T2DM
)
.

The
renal
sodium-glucose
co-transporter
2
(
SGLT2
)
is
responsible
for
reabsorption
of
most
of
the
glucose
filtered
by
the
kidney
.

Inhibitors
of
SGLT2
lower
blood
glucose
independent
of
the
secretion
and
action
of
insulin
by
inhibiting
renal
reabsorption
of
glucose
,
thereby
promoting
the
increased
urinary
excretion
of
excess
glucose
.

Canagliflozin
,
dapagliflozin
,
and
empagliflozin
are
SGLT2
inhibitors
approved
as
treatments
for
T2DM
in
the
United
States
,
Europe
,
and
other
countries
.

Canagliflozin
,
dapagliflozin
,
and
empagliflozin
increase
renal
excretion
of
glucose
and
improve
glycemic
parameters
in
patients
with
T2DM
when
used
as
monotherapy
or
in
combination
with
other
antihyperglycemic
agents
.

Treatment
with
SGLT2
inhibitors
is
associated
with
weight
reduction
,
lowered
blood
pressure
,
and
a
low
intrinsic
propensity
to
cause
hypoglycemia
.

Overall
,
canagliflozin
,
dapagliflozin
,
and
empagliflozin
are
well
tolerated
.

Cases
of
genital
infections
and
,
in
some
studies
,
urinary
tract
infections
have
been
more
frequent
in
canagliflozin-
,
dapagliflozin-
,
and
empagliflozin-treated
patients
compared
with
those
receiving
placebo
.

Evidence
from
clinical
trials
suggests
that
SGLT2
inhibitors
are
a
promising
new
treatment
option
for
T2DM
.
The
amiloride-sensitive
epithelial
Na
(
+
)
channel
(
ENaC
)
controls
Na
(
+
)
transport
into
cells
and
across
epithelia
.

So
far
,
four
homologous
subunits
of
mammalian
ENaC
have
been
isolated
and
are
denoted
as
alpha
,
beta
,
gamma
,
and
delta
.

ENaCdelta
can
associate
with
beta
and
gamma
subunits
and
generate
a
constitutive
current
that
is
2
orders
of
magnitude
larger
than
that
of
homomeric
ENaCdelta
.

However
,
the
distribution
pattern
of
ENaCdelta
is
not
consistent
with
that
of
the
beta
and
gamma
subunits
.

ENaCdelta
is
expressed
mainly
in
the
brain
in
contrast
to
beta
and
gamma
subunits
,
which
are
expressed
in
non-neuronal
tissues
.

To
explain
this
discrepancy
,
we
searched
for
novel
functional
properties
of
homomeric
ENaCdelta
and
investigated
the
detailed
tissue
distribution
in
humans
.

When
human
ENaCdelta
was
expressed
in
Xenopus
oocytes
and
Chinese
hamster
ovary
cells
,
a
reduction
of
extracellular
pH
activated
this
channel
(
half-maximal
pH
for
an
activation
of
5
.
0
)
,
and
the
acid-induced
current
was
abolished
by
amiloride
.

The
most
striking
finding
was
that
the
desensitization
of
the
acid-evoked
current
was
much
slower
(
by
approximately
10%
120
s
later
)
,
dissociating
from
the
kinetics
of
acid-sensing
ion
channels
in
the
degenerin
/
epithelial
Na
(
+
)
channel
family
,
which
were
rapidly
desensitized
during
acidification
.

RNA
dot-blot
analyses
showed
that
ENaCdelta
mRNA
was
widely
distributed
throughout
the
brain
and
was
also
expressed
in
the
heart
,
kidney
,
and
pancreas
in
humans
.

Northern
blotting
confirmed
that
ENaCdelta
was
expressed
in
the
cerebellum
and
the
hippocampus
.

In
conclusion
,
human
ENaCdelta
activity
is
regulated
by
protons
,
indicating
that
it
may
contribute
to
the
pH
sensation
and

Tramadol
,
a
centrally
acting
analgesic
structurally
related
to
codeine
and
morphine
,
consists
of
two
enantiomers
,
both
of
which
contribute
to
analgesic
activity
via
different
mechanisms
.

(

)
-Tramadol
and
the
metabolite
(

)
-O-desmethyl-tramadol
(
M1
)
are
agonists
of
the

and
(
-
)
-tramadol
inhibits
norepinephrine
reuptake
,
enhancing
inhibitory
effects

transmission
in

.

The
complementary
and
synergistic
actions
of
the
two
enantiomers
improve
the
analgesic
efficacy
and
tolerability
profile
of
the
racemate
.

Tramadol
is
available
as
drops
,
capsules
and
sustained-release
formulations
for
oral
use
,
suppositories
for
rectal
use
and
solution
for
intramuscular
,
intravenous
and
subcutaneous
injection
.

After
oral
administration
,
tramadol
is
rapidly
and
almost
completely
absorbed
.

.

Tramadol
is
rapidly
distributed
in
the
body;
plasma
protein
binding
is
about
20%
.

Tramadol
is
mainly
metabolised
by
O-
and
N-demethylation
and
by
conjugation
reactions
forming
glucuronides
and
sulfates
.

Tramadol
and
its
metabolites
are
mainly
excreted
via
the
kidneys
.

The
mean
elimination
half-life
is
about
6
hours
.

The
O-demethylation
of
tramadol
to
M1
,
the
main
analgesic
effective
metabolite
,
is
catalysed
by
cytochrome
P450
(
CYP
)
2D6
,
whereas
N-demethylation
to
M2
is
catalysed
by
CYP2B6
and
CYP3A4
.

The
wide
variability
in
the
pharmacokinetic
properties
of
tramadol
can
partly
be
ascribed
to
CYP
polymorphism
.

O-
and
N-demethylation
of
tramadol
as
well
as
renal
elimination
are
stereoselective
.

Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic
characterisation
of
tramadol
is
difficult
because
of
differences
between
tramadol
concentrations
in
plasma
and
at
the
site
of
action
,
and
because
of
pharmacodynamic
interactions
between
the
two
enantiomers
of
tramadol
and
its
active
metabolites
.

The
analgesic
potency
of
tramadol
is
about
10%
of
that
of
morphine
following
parenteral
administration
.

Tramadol
provides
postoperative
pain
relief
comparable
with
that
of
pethidine
,
and
the
analgesic
efficacy
of
tramadol
can
further
be
improved
by
combination
with
a
non-opioid
analgesic
.

Tramadol
may
prove
particularly
useful
in
patients
with
a
risk
of
poor
cardiopulmonary
function
,
after
surgery
of
the
thorax
or
upper
abdomen
and
when
non-opioid
analgesics
are
contraindicated
.

Tramadol
is
an
effective
and
well
tolerated
agent
to
reduce
pain
resulting
from
trauma
,
renal
or
biliary
colic
and
labour
,
and
also
for
the
management
of
chronic
pain
of
malignant
or
nonmalignant
origin
,

Adapalene

drug
proposed
for
the
treatment
of
acne
patients
.

Studies
on
the
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
pharmacology
of
adapalene
have
shown
that
it
is
very
active
on
cell
and
tissue
proliferation
and
differentiation
.

Furthermore
,
adapalene
has
anti-inflammatory
potential
as
determined
by
its
anti-AP1
activity
.

Adapalene
interacts
selectively
with
the
nuclear
receptors
RAR
beta
and
RAR
gamma
,
and
its
activity
on
proliferation
and
differentiation
can
be
blocked
by
a
RAR
beta-gamma
antagonist
.

Because
RAR
beta
is
not
expressed
in
human
keratinocytes
,
the
effect
of
adapalene
on
the
major
cell
type
of
the
epidermis
is
certainly
mediated
by
its
interaction
with
RAR
gamma

unique
pharmacological
properties
of
adapalene
may
explain
why
,
when
compared
to
tretinoin
,
it
has

This
study
evaluates
the
production
of
inflammatory
biomarkers
(
IL-1β
,
IL-8
,
IL-10
,
TNFα
)
and
the
influence
of

related
to
cholesterol
absorption
and
metabolism
(
NPC1L1

,

,
ACAT
)
produced
by
7-ketosterols
(
stigmasterol
/
cholesterol
)
in
Caco-2
cells
.

These
effects
were
linked
to
intracellular
signaling
pathways
by
using
several
inhibitors
.

Results
showed
7-ketostigmasterol
to
have
a
greater
proinflammatory
potential
than
7-ketocholesterol
.

In
non-pre-treated
cells
,
only
efflux
transporters
were
down-regulated
by
7-ketosterols
,
showing
a
greater
influence
upon
ABCG5
expression
.

Cell-pre-incubation
with
bradykinin
induced
changes
in
ABCG
expression
levels
after
7-ketostigmasterol-incubation;
however
,
the
energetic
metabolism
inhibition
reduced
NPC1L1
expression
only
in
7-ketocholesterol-incubated
cells
.

In
non-pre-treated
cells
,
HMG-CoA
was
up-regulated
by
both
7-ketosterols
.

However
,
exposure
to
inhibitors
down-regulated
the
expression
levels
,
mainly
in
7-ketocholesterol-incubated
cells
.

While
ACAT
expression
values
in
non-pre-treated
cells
were
unchanged
,
exposure
to
inhibitors
caused
down-regulation
of
mRNA
levels
.

These
results
suggest
that
internalization
and
excretion
of
7-ketostigmasterol
is
probably
influenced
by
[
Ca
]
i
,
which
also
could
mediate
HMGCoA
activity
in

metabolism
.

However
,
energetic

exert
different
influences
upon

Epidemiological

Pulmonary
macrophages
are

both
the
innate

In
the
present

in

alveolar

and
bone
marrow-derived
macrophages
(

were
exposed

)
and
mice
were
exposed

.

In

studies
demonstrated
that
WS-exposed
mice
inoculated
with

had
a
higher
bacterial
load
24
h
post-exposure
,
and
corresponding
AM
were
found
to
have
decreased

activity
.

Additionally
,
while
classic
markers
of
inflammation
(
cellular
infiltration
,
total
protein
,
neutrophils
)
were
not
affected
,
there
were
changes
in
pulmonary
macrophages
populations
,
including
significant
decreases
in
macrophages
expressing
markers
of
activation
in
WS-exposed
mice
.

The
lymphocyte
activation
activity
of
WS-PM-exposed
AM
was
significantly
suppressed
,
but
the
phagocytic
activity
appeared
unchanged
.

In
an
effort
to
determine
a
pathway
for
WS-induced
suppression
,
RelB
activation
,
assessed
by
nuclear
translocation
,
was
observed
in

exposed

Finally
,
an

However
,
there
were

undetectable

of

in

,
indicating
that
these
3β-HSD

were
newly
formed

.

The
mRNA
level
for

was
significantly
increased
in
the
control

but
not
in
the

suggesting
that
these

All
together
,
they
indicate
that
aversive
property
of
ethanol
is
dependent
on
ethanol
action
on
α2-containing
GABA
(
A
)
-R
.

Deletion
of
the
α2-subunit
led
to
faster
recovery
whereas
absence
of
the
α3-subunit
slowed
recovery
from
ethanol-induced
incoordination
(
rotarod
)
.

Deletion
of
the
other
four
subunits
did
not
affect
this
behavior
.

Similar
changes
in
this
behavior
for
the
α2
and
α3
null
mutants
were
found
for
flurazepam
motor
incoordination
.

However
,
no
differences
in
recovery
were
found
in
motor-incoordinating
effects
of
an
α1-selective
modulator
(
zolpidem
)
or
an
α4-selective
agonist
(
gaboxadol
)
.

Therefore
,
recovery
of
rotarod
incoordination
is
under
control
of
two
GABA
(
A
)
-R
subunits
:
α2
and
α3
.

For
motor
activity
,
α3
null
mice
demonstrated
higher
activation
by
ethanol
(
1
g
/
kg
)
whereas
both
α2
(
-
/
-
)
and
α3
(
-
/
Y
)
knockout
mice
were
less
sensitive
to
ethanol-induced
reduction
of
motor
activity
(

.
5
g
/
kg
)
.

These
studies
demonstrate
that
the
effects
of
ethanol
at
GABAergic
synapses
containing
α2
subunit
are
important
for
specific
behavioral
effects
of
ethanol
which
may
be
relevant
to
the
genetic
linkage
of
the
α2
subunit
with
human
alcoholism

Phenelzine
(

is

properties
.

Acute
and
chronic
PLZ
administration
increase
brain
GABA
levels
,
an
effect
due
,
at
least
in
part
,
to
an
inhibition
of
the
activity
of
the
GABA
metabolizing
enzyme
,
GABA
transaminase
(
GABA-T
)
.

.

Previous
preliminary
reports
have
indicated
that
acute
PLZ
treatment
also
elevates
brain
alanine
levels
.

As
with
GABA
,
the
metabolism
of
alanine
involves
a
pyridoxal
phosphate-dependent
transaminase
.

.

In
the
study
reported
here
,
the
effects
of
acute
PLZ
treatment
on
the
levels
of
various
amino
acids
,
some
of
which
are
also
metabolized
by
pyridoxal
phosphate-dependent
transaminases
were
compared
in
rat
whole
brain
.

Of
the
6
amino
acids
investigated
,
only
GABA
and
alanine
levels
were
elevated
(
in
a
time-
and
dose-dependent
manner
)
.

4
.

The
elevation
in
brain
alanine
levels
could
be
explained
,
at
least
in
part
,
by
a
time-
and
dose-dependent
inhibitory
effect
of
PLZ
on
alanine
transaminase
(
ALA-T
)
,
although
as
with
GABA
the
increases
are
higher
than
expected
from
the
degree
of
enzyme
inhibition
produced
.

In
addition
,
we
also
showed
that
the
elevation
in
alanine
levels
and
the
inhibition
of
alanine
transaminase
in
the
brain
are
retained
after
14
days
of
PLZ
treatment
,
and
that
PLZ
produces
a
marked
increase
in
extracellular
levels
of
alanine
.

These
results
are
discussed
in
terms
of
their
relevance
to
synaptic
function
and
to
the
pharmacological
profile
of

Sepracor
in
the
US
is
developing
arformoterol
[
R
,
R-formoterol
]
,
a
single
isomer
form
of
the
beta
(
2
)
-adrenoceptor
agonist
formoterol
[
eformoterol
]
.

This
isomer
contains
two
chiral
centres
and
is
being
developed
as
an
inhaled
preparation
for
the
treatment
of
respiratory
disorders
.

Sepracor
believes
that
arformoterol
has
the
potential
to
be
a
once-daily
therapy
with
a
rapid
onset
of
action
and
a
duration
of
effect
exceeding
12
hours
.

In
1995
,
Sepracor
acquired
New
England
Pharmaceuticals
,
a
manufacturer
of
metered-dose
and
dry
powder
inhalers
,
for
the
purpose
of
preparing
formulations
of
levosalbutamol
and
arformoterol
.

Phase
II
dose-ranging
clinical
studies
of
arformoterol
as
a
longer-acting
,
complementary
bronchodilator
were
completed
successfully
in
the
fourth
quarter
of
2000
.

Phase
III
trials
of
arformoterol
began
in
September
2001
.

The
indications
for
the
drug
appeared
to
be
asthma
and
chronic
obstructive
pulmonary
disease
(
COPD
)
.

However
,
an
update
of
the
pharmaceutical
product
information
on
the
Sepracor
website
in
September
2003
listed
COPD
maintenance
therapy
as
the
only
indication
for
arformoterol
.

In
October
2002
,
Sepracor
stated
that
two
pivotal
phase
III
studies
were
ongoing
in
1600
patients
.

Sepracor
estimates
that
its
NDA
submission
for
arformoterol
,
which
is
projected
for
the
first
half
of
2004
,
will
include
approximately
3000
adult
subjects
.

Sepracor
stated
in
July
2003
that
it
had
completed
more
than
100
preclinical
studies
and
initiated
or
completed
15
clinical
studies
for
arformoterol
inhalation
solution
for
the
treatment
of
bronchospasm
in
patients
with
COPD
.

In
addition
,
Sepracor
stated
that
the
two
pivotal
phase
III
studies
in
1600
patients
were
still
progressing
.

In
1995
,
European
patents
were
granted
to

for
the
use
of

In
the

,
a
quantitative

their
masked

was
conducted
on
a
national

using
the

The

estimated
from

.

According
to
a

,
the

for
the

Stimulation

In
addition
,
activation

The

simvastatin
inhibits
LFA-1
signaling
by
binding
to
an
allosteric
site
on
CD11a
(
LFA-1
alpha
chain
)
,
which
leads
to
immunomodulation
.

We
found
that
simvastatin
abolishes
anti-CD11a
mAb-induced
increases
in
lymphocytic
cholinergic
activity
in
a
manner
independent
of
its
cholesterol-lowering
activity
.

Collectively
then
,
these
results
indicate
that
LFA-1
contributes
to
the
regulation
of
lymphocytic
cholinergic
activity
via
CD11a-mediated
pathways
and
suggest
that
simvastatin
exerts
its
immunosuppressive
effects
in
part
via
modification
of
lymphocytic
cholinergic
activity
.

were
evaluated
.

Using

with

,
181

,
and
26
patients

trials
,
the
disposition
of

was
best
described
by
a
2-compartment
model
with

absorption
and
a

,
age
over

However
,
the
magnitude
of
predicted
changes
in
exposure

not
warrant
dose
adjustments

Multivariate
Cox

analyses
showed
that

EXPERT
OPINION
:
Canagliflozin
offers
a

this

elucidated
specific
domains
responsible
for
this

showed
a
great
increase
in
ligand
sensitivity
to
GnRH-I

not
to

.

in

exhibited
an
approximately
500-fold
increased

to

indicating
that
these

are
critical
for

,

the
understanding
of

Drug
development
for
multiple
sclerosis
(
MS
)
,
as
with
any
other
neurological
disease
,
faces
numerous
challenges
,
with
many
drugs
failing
at
various
stages
of
development
.

The
disease-modifying
therapies
(
DMTs
)
first
introduced
for
MS
are
only
moderately
effective
,
but
given
the
lack
of
competition
,
they
have
been
widely
accepted
in
clinical
practice
.

Although
safety
and
efficacy
continue
to
be
the
two
main
metrics
by
which
drugs
will
be
judged
,
the
newer
agents
in
the
market
also
face
challenges
of
a
more
comparative
nature-are
they
more
efficacious
than
the
currently
available
drugs
on
the
market?
Are
they
safer
or
better
tolerated?
Do
they
offer
any
practical
advantages
over
current
treatments?
Fingolimod
represented
a
milestone
following
its
approval
as
an
oral
drug
for
MS
in
2010
,
offering
patients
a
far
more
convenient
administration
route
.

However
,
association
with
cardiovascular
complications
has
led
to
a
more
cautious
approach
in
its
initial
prescribing
,
now
requiring
cardiac
monitoring
for
the
first
6
h
as
well
as
subsequent
monitoring
of
blood
pressure
and
for
macular
oedema
.

Natalizumab
,
amongst
licensed
drugs
,
represents
the
current
benchmark
for
efficacy
.

The
risk
of
progressive
multifocal
leukoencephalopathy
during
natalizumab
treatment
is
now
more
quantifiable
.

Other
monoclonal
antibodies
are
in
various
phases
of
development
.

Marketing
authorisation
for
alemtuzumab
has
been
filed
,
and
whilst
trial
data
suggest
that
its
efficacy
outperforms
both
licensed
drugs
and
others
in
development
,
there
is
a
significant
risk
of
secondary
autoimmunity
.

Its
once-yearly
administration
,
however
,
seems
particularly
advantageous
.

Rituximab
is
unlikely
to
be
developed
further
as
its
license
will
expire
,
but
ocrelizumab
,
another
monoclonal
antibody
directly
targeting
B
cells
,
is
currently
in
phase
2
development
and
looks
promising
.

Daclizumab
is
also
moderately
efficacious
but
may
struggle
to
establish
itself
given
its
monthly
subcutaneous
dosing
.

There
are
new
oral
drugs
in
development
,
and
it
is
likely
that
BG-12
will
be
licensed
this
year
.

This
has
been
licensed
for
psoriasis
so
there
are
good
safety
data
in
humans
that
may
also
hold
true
in
MS;
however
,
its
three
times
daily
dosage
will
probably
impact
on
patient
compliance
.

Laquinimod
has
lower
efficacy
than
BG-12
but
appears
safe
and
could
find
a
place
as
a
first-line
agent
.

Teriflunomide
has
just
been
licensed
by
the
US
FDA
and
may
challenge
the
current
injectable
first-line
therapies
as
it
has
a
similar
efficacy
but
the
advantage
of
being
taken
orally
.

However
,
risk
of
teratogenicity
may
caution
against
its
use
in
some
women
of
child-bearing
potential
.

This
review
will
examine
drugs
that
have
been
recently
approved
as
well
as
those
that
are
in
late
phase
2
or
3
development
as
treatment
for
relapsing
MS
,
highlighting
their
mechanism
of
action
as
well
as
the
clinical
trial
and
safety
data
before
discussing
their
potential
for
success
in
an
increasingly
florid
and
complex
DMT
armamentarium
.
The
type
1
cannabinoid
receptor
(
CB1
)
is
a
G
protein-coupled
receptor
that
is
expressed
at
high
levels
in
the
striatum
.

Activation
of
CB1
increases
expression
of
neuronal
trophic
factors
and
inhibits
neurotransmitter
release
from
GABA-ergic
striatal
neurons
.

CB1
mRNA
levels
can
be
elevated
by
treatment
with
cannabinoids
in
non-neuronal
cells
.

We
wanted
to
determine
whether
cannabinoid
treatment
could
induce
CB1
expression
in
a
cell
culture
model
of
striatal
neurons
and
,
if
possible
,
determine
the
molecular
mechanism
by
which
this
occurred
.

We
found
that
treatment
of
STHdh
(
7
/
7
)
cells
with
the
cannabinoids
ACEA
,
mAEA
,
and
AEA
produced
a
CB1
receptor-dependent
increase
in
CB1
promoter
activity
,
mRNA
,
and
protein
expression
.

This
response
was
Akt-
and
NF-κB-dependent
.

Because
decreased
CB1
expression
is
thought
to
contribute
to
the
pathogenesis
of
Huntington's
disease
(
HD
)
,
we
wanted
to
determine
whether
cannabinoids
could
increase
CB1
expression
in
STHdh
(
7
/
111
)
and
(
111
/
111
)
cells
expressing
the
mutant
huntingtin
protein
.

We
observed
that
cannabinoid
treatment
increased
CB1
mRNA
levels
approximately
10-fold
in
STHdh
(
7
/
111
)
and
(
111
/
111
)
cells
,
compared
to
vehicle
treatment
.

Importantly
,
cannabinoid
treatment
improved
ATP
production
,
increased
the
expression
of
the
trophic
factor
BDNF-2
,
and
the
mitochondrial
regulator
PGC1α
,
and
reduced
spontaneous
GABA
release
,
in
HD
cells
.

Therefore
,
cannabinoid-mediated
increases
in
CB1
levels
could
reduce
the
severity
of
some
molecular
pathologies
observed
in
HD
.

In
this
study
,
the
stabilization
effects
of
three
polymers
on
four
model
drugs
(
felodipine
,
fenofibrate
,
carbamazepine
,
and
celecoxib
)
under
saturated
humidity
were
investigated
.

Three
different
types
of
thin
films
(
solid
dispersions
,
drug
films
with
a
polymer
film
coating
and
drug
films
laid
on
top
of
polymer
coated
surfaces
)
were
prepared
and
compared
with
films
containing
the
drug
alone
.

ATR-FTIR
spectroscopy
,
polarised
light
microscopy
(
PLM
)
,
scanning
electron
microscopy
(
SEM
)
and
nano-thermal
analysis
(
nano-TA
)
were
performed
on
the
model
systems
after
storage
under
saturated
humidity
.

The
recrystallisation
tendency
of
the
drug
in
the
drug
containing
thin
films
was
found
to
be
strongly
related
to
the
intrinsic
crystallization
tendency
of
the
drug
film
alone
and
the
strength
of
drug-polymer
interactions
.

Additionally
,
under
high
humidity
,
the
glass
transition
temperature
of
the
polymer
is
no
longer
an
indicator
of
its
drug
stabilization
capability
.

Instead
,
it
is
the
hygroscobicity
of
the
polymer
that
appears
to
be
the
most
important
parameter
.

Amongst
the
polymers
tested
in
this
study
,
EUDRAGIT
E
PO
was
found
to
have
the
greatest
inhibitory
effect
on
crystallization
,
whilst
PVP
K30
was
found
to
have
the
least
protective
effect;
presumably
because
of
its
hygroscopic
nature
.

PURPOSE
:
RRM1
encodes
the
regulatory
subunit
of
ribonucleotide
reductase
and
is
a
molecular
target
of
gemcitabine
.

Previous
studies
showed
increased
RRM1
expression
on
continuous
exposure
of
cell
lines
to
gemcitabine
and
suggested
improved
survival
for
patients
with
low
as
opposed
to
high
tumoral
RRM1
expression
when
treated
with
gemcitabine-containing
chemotherapy
.

However
,
the
principal
hypothesis
that
intratumoral
levels
of
gene
expression
are
associated
with
disease
response
has
not
been
addressed
.

PATIENTS
AND
METHODS
:
We
constructed
genetically
modified
lung
cancer
cell
lines
with
increased
and
decreased
RRM1
expression
to
investigate
the
in
vitro
50%
inhibitory
concentration
(
IC50
)
for
gemcitabine
,
cisplatin
,
and
carboplatin
.

A
prospective
phase
II
clinical
trial
in
patients
with
locally
advanced
non-small-cell
lung
cancer
was
conducted
with
pretreatment
tumor
collection
for
determination
of
RRM1
and
ERCC1
expression
by
real-time
reverse
transcriptase
polymerase
chain
reaction
.

The
levels
of
gene
expression
were
correlated
with
tumor
response
after
two
cycles
of
gemcitabine
and
carboplatin
.

RESULTS
:
In
cell
lines
with
a
genetically
engineered
15-fold
RRM1
expression
range
,
the
gemcitabine
IC50
had
a
100-fold
range
,
and
the
cisplatin
and
carboplatin
IC50
had
a
two-fold
range
.

They
were
highest
in
constructs
with
high
RRM1
expression
.

In
the
prospective
clinical
trial
,
RRM1
expression
was
significantly
(
P
=
.
002
)
and
inversely
correlated
(
r
=
-0
.
498
)
with
disease
response
.

ERCC1
expression
showed
a
similar
trend
(
P
=
.
099
)
.

CONCLUSION
:
The
results
strongly
suggest
that
tumoral
RRM1
expression
is
a
major
predictor
of
disease
response
to
gemcitabine
/
platinum
chemotherapy
.

ERCC1
expression
is
predictive
of
response
albeit
to
a
lesser
degree
.
Membrane
traffic
requires
the
specific
concentration
of
protein
cargos
and
exclusion
of
other
proteins
into
nascent
carriers
.

Critical
components
of
this
selectivity
are
the
protein
adaptors
that
bind
to
short
,
linear
motifs
in
the
cytoplasmic
tails
of
transmembrane
protein
cargos
and
sequester
them
into
nascent
carriers
.

The
recruitment
of
the
adaptors
is
mediated
by
activated
Arf
GTPases
and
the
Arf-adaptor
complexes
mark
sites
of
carrier
formation
.

However
,
the
nature
of
the
signal
(
s
)
that
initiate
carrier
biogenesis
remains
unknown
.

We
examined
the
specificity
and
initial
sites
of
recruitment
of
Arf-dependent
adaptors
(
AP-1
and
GGAs
)
in
response
to
the
Golgi
or
endosomal
localization
of
specific
cargo
proteins
(
furin
,
mannose-6-phosphate
receptor
(
M6PR
)
and
M6PR
lacking
a
C-terminal
domain
M6PRΔC
)
.

We
find
that
cargo
promotes
the
recruitment
of
specific
adaptors
,
suggesting
that
it
is
part
of
an
upstream
signaling
event
.

Cargos
do
not
promote
adaptor
recruitment
to
all
compartments
in
which
they
reside
and
thus
additional
factors
regulate
the
cargo's
ability
to
promote
Arf
activation
and
adaptor
recruitment
.

We
document
that
within
a
given
compartment
different
cargos
recruit
different
adaptors
suggesting
that
there
is
little
or
no
free
,
activated
Arf
at
the
membrane
and
that
Arf
activation
is
spatially
and
temporally
coupled
to
the
cargo
and
the
adaptor
.

Using
temperature
block
,
Brefeldin
A
,
and
recovery
from
each
,
we
found
that
the
cytoplasmic
tail
of
M6PR
causes
the
recruitment
of
AP-1
and
GGAs
to
recycling
endosomes
and
not
at
the
Golgi
,
as
predicted
by
steady
state
staining
profiles
.

These
results
are
discussed
with
respect
to
the
generation
of
novel
models
for
cargo-dependent
regulation
of
membrane
traffic
.

Tamoxifen
,
which
is
the
most
commonly
used
drug
for
treatment
of
breast
cancer
,
has
both
estrogen
agonist
and
antagonist
actions
.

Pure
antiestrogens
are
devoid
of
any
estrogen
agonist
effects
.

ICI
182
,
780
(
fulvestrant
)
(
Faslodex
)
and
ICI
164
,
384
are
competitive
inhibitors
of
estrogen
by
binding
to
the
estrogen
receptor
(
ER
)
.

Preclinical
and
clinical
studies
show
that
fulvestrant
and
ICI
164
,
384
are
more
potent
than
tamoxifen
in
inhibiting
the
growth
of
breast
cancer
cells
.

They
are
devoid
of
any
estrogen-agonist
action
on
the
uterus
and
vagina
but
lack
the
beneficial
effects
of
tamoxifen
on
the
bone
and
serum
lipid
profile
.

Fulvestrant
is
the
first
pure
antiestrogen
to
complete
phase
III
clinical
trials
.

Such
studies
have
shown
that
fulvestrant
is
at
least
as
good
as
anastrozole
in
the
treatment
of
post-menopausal
women
with
advanced
breast
cancer
who
had
relapsed
or
progressed
on
prior
endocrine
therapy
.

The
drug
was
well
tolerated
and
only
minor
side-effects
were
reported
.

Its
potential
role
in
the
adjuvant
setting
will
be
determined
by
its
adverse
effects
on
bone
mass
and
serum
lipids
.

EM-800
and
EM-652
are
the
most
potent
pure
antiestrogens
and
EM-652
has
the
highest
affinity
of
all
antiestrogens
to
ER
.

They
have
no
stimulatory
effects
on
the
uterus
or
vagina
.

It
seems
reasonable
to
expect
that
pure
antiestrogens
will
be
good
alternatives
to
tamoxifen
and
aromatase
inhibitors
in
the
treatment
of
breast
cancer
.

Polyunsaturated

inhibit

We
examined
in

keratinocyte
cell
line
whether
eicosapentaenoic
acid
(
EPA
)
a
n-3
PUFA
,
gamma-linoleic

(

a

,
modulate
expression
of
cyclooxygenase-2
(
COX-2
)
,
an
enzyme
pivotal
to

.

We
demonstrate
that
only
treatment
of
HaCaT
with
GLA
and
EPA
or
a
PPARgamma
ligand
(
roziglitazone
)
,
induced
COX-2
expression
(
protein
and
mRNA
)
.

Moreover
stimulation
of
COX-2
promoter
activity
was
increased
by
those
PUFAs
or
rosiglitazone
.

The
inhibitory
effects
of
GW9662
and
T0070907
(
PPARgamma
antagonists
)
,
on
COX-2
expression
and
on
stimulation
of
COX-2
promoter
activity
by
EPA
and
GLA
suggest
that
PPARgamma
is
implicated
in
COX-2
induction
.

Finally
,
PLA2
inhibitor
methyl
arachidonyl
fluorophosphonate
blocked
the
PUFA
effects
on
COX-2
induction
,
promoter

and

suggesting
involvement

These
findings
demonstrate
that
n-3
and
n-6
PUFA
increased
PPARgamma
activity
is
necessary
for
the
COX-2
induction
in
HaCaT
human
keratinocyte
cells
.

Given
the
anti-inflammatory
properties
of
EPA
,
we
suggest
that
induction
of
COX-2
in
keratinocytes
may
be
important
in
the
anti-inflammatory
and
protective
mechanism
of
action
of

In
breast
cancer
(
BC
)
epithelial
cells
,
the
mitogenic
action
of
estradiol
is
transduced
through
binding
to
two
receptors
,
ERα
and
ERβ
,
which
act
as
transcription
factors
.

Anti-estrogens
(
AEs
)
and
aromatase
inhibitors
(
AIs
)
are
used
clinically
to
arrest
the
estrogen-dependent
growth
of
BC
.

In
the
case
of
AE
or
AI
resistance
,
Herceptin
or
lapatinib
may
be
used
to
inhibit
growth
factors
.

Estrogen
effects
are
mediated
not
only
through
nuclear
ERs
but
also
through
cytoplasmic
/
membrane
ERs
and
G-protein-coupled
ERs
.

These
estrogen-binding
systems
associate
with
various
proteins
that
direct
cell
cycle
signaling
,
proliferation
and
survival
.

The
partners
of
nuclear
ER
include
SRC1-3
,
HDACs
and
ERβ
itself
as
well
as
newly
identified
proteins
,
such
as
E6-AP
,
LKB1
,
PELP1
,
PAX-2
and
FOXA1
.

The
partners
of
extra-nuclear
ERα
include
PI3K
and
the
tyrosine
kinase
Src
.

These
various
factors
are
all
potential
targets
for
therapeutic
intervention
.

In
addition
,
BC
proliferation
is
enhanced
by
insulin
and
EGF
,
which
stimulate
signaling
through
the
MAPK
and
PI3K
/
AKT
pathways
by
activation
of
the
IGF-1R
and
EGFR
axes
,
respectively
.

These
pathways
are
tightly
interconnected
with
ER-activated
signaling
,
and
membrane
ERα
forms
complexes
with
Src
and
PI3K
.

Chemokine-mediated
signaling
also
modulates
the
estrogen
response
.

Inhibiting
these
pathways
with
specific
inhibitors
or
activating
some
of
the
pathways
by
gene
manipulation
may
be
therapeutically
valuable
for
arresting
BC
cell
cycle
progression
and
for
inducing
apoptosis
to
antagonize
hormone-resistance
.

The
discovery
of
methods
suitable
for
the
conversion
in
vitro
of
native
proteins
into
amyloid
fibrils
has
shed
light
on
the
molecular
basis
of
amyloidosis
and
has
provided
fundamental
tools
for
drug
discovery
.

We
have
studied
the
capacity
of
a
small
library
of
tetracycline
analogues
to
modulate
the
formation
or
destructuration
of
beta2-microglobulin
fibrils
.

The
inhibition
of
fibrillogenesis
of
the
wild
type
protein
was
first
established
in
the
presence
of
20%
trifluoroethanol
and
confirmed
under
a
more
physiologic
environment
including
heparin
and
collagen
.

The
latter
conditions
were
also
used
to
study
the
highly
amyloidogenic
variant
,
P32G
.

The
NMR
analysis
showed
that
doxycycline
inhibits
beta2-microglobulin
self-association
and
stabilizes
the
native-like
species
through
fast
exchange
interactions
involving
specific
regions
of
the
protein
.

Cell
viability
assays
demonstrated
that
the
drug
abolishes
the
natural
cytotoxic
activity
of
soluble
beta2-microglobulin
,
further
strengthening
a
possible
in
vivo
therapeutic
exploitation
of
this
drug
.

Doxycycline
can
disassemble
preformed
fibrils
,
but
the
IC
(
50
)
is
5-fold
higher
than
that
necessary
for
the
inhibition
of
fibrillogenesis
.

Fibril
destructuration
is
a
dynamic
and
time-dependent
process
characterized
by
the
early
formation
of
cytotoxic
protein
aggregates
that
,
in
a
few
hours
,
convert
into
non-toxic
insoluble
material
.

The
efficacy
of
doxycycline
as
a
drug
against
dialysis-related
amyloidosis
would
benefit
from
the
ability
of
the
drug
to
accumulate
just
in
the
skeletal
system
where
amyloid
is
formed
.

In
these
tissues
,
the
doxycycline
concentration
reaches
values
several
folds
higher
than
those
resulting
in
inhibition
of
amyloidogenesis
and
amyloid
destructuration
in
vitro
.

but
,
when
given

resulted

(

generalized
completely
and
was
similar
in
potency
to
bupropion
(
ED50
=
5
.
4
mg
/
kg
)
.

Bupropion
and
its
metabolites
lacked

receptors
,
but
all
antagonized

S

S-Hydroxybupropion
possessed
affinity
at
the
dopamine
transporter
comparable
to
bupropion
,
and
was
also
found
to
bind
at
the
norepinephrine
transporter
.

Although
it
is
unlikely
that
any
metabolite
isomer
is
chiefly
responsible
for
the
stimulus
actions
of
bupropion
,
some
probably
play
a

Based
on
recent
reports
that
the
small
molecules
,
isatin
and
phthalimide
,
are
suitable
scaffolds
for
the
design
of
high
potency
monoamine
oxidase
(
MAO
)
inhibitors
,
the
present
study
examines
the
MAO
inhibitory
properties
of
a
series
of
phthalide
[
2-benzofuran-1
(
3H
)
-one
]
analogues
.

Phthalide
is
structurally
related
to
isatin
and
phthalimide
and
it
is
demonstrated
here
that
substitution
at
C6
of
the
phthalide
moiety
yields
compounds
endowed
with
high
binding
affinities
to
both
human
MAO
isoforms
.

Among
the
nineteen
homologues
evaluated
,
the
lowest
IC
(
50
)
values
recorded
for
the
inhibition
of
MAO-A
and
-B
were
0
.
096
and
0
.
0014
μM
,
respectively
.

In
most
instances
,
C6-substituted
phthalides
exhibit
MAO-B
specific
inhibition
.

Among
a
series
of
6-benzyloxyphthalides
bearing
substituents
on
the
para
position
of
the
phenyl
ring
the
general
order
of
potency
was
CF
(
3
)
>
I
>
Br
>
Cl
>
F
>
CH
(

>
H
.

The
results
also
show
that
the
binding
modes
of
representative
phthalides
are
reversible
and
competitive
at
both
MAO
isoforms
.

Based
on
these
data
,

Pathological
gambling
(
PG
)
is
an
impulse
control
disorder
that
has
been
considered
as
a
behavioral
addiction
.

Recent
studies
have
suggested
the
involvement
of
the
dopaminergic
system
in
addictions
and
impulse
control
disorders
and
associations
of
dopamine
receptor
genes
(
DRD1
,
DRD2
,
and
DRD4
)
and
PG
have
been
reported
.

In
the
present
study
,
140
sib-pairs
discordant
for
the
diagnosis
of
PG
(
70
males
and
70
females
on
each
group
)
were
recruited
through
the
Gambling
Outpatient
Unit
at
the
Institute
of
Psychiatry
,
University
of
Sao
Paulo
and
were
assessed
by
trained
psychiatrists
.

A
family-based

design
was
chosen
to
prevent
population
stratification

All

and
the

Our

Increasing
evidence
suggests
that
25-hydroxyvitamin
D
[
25

OH
)
D
]
and
parathyroid
hormone
(
PTH
)
levels
are
associated
with
metabolic
syndrome
(
MetS
)
.

In
2010
,
we
explored
the
association
of
serum
25
(
OH
)
D
and
PTH
levels
with
MetS
in
1
,
390
Chinese
participants
,
aged
20-83
years
.

Anthropometric
phenotypes
,
blood

,
and
the
incidence
of
MetS
were
evaluated
.

In
addition
,
serum
lipids
,
25
(
OH
)
D
,
and
PTH
were
measured
.

The
median
concentration
of
25
(
OH
)
D
and
PTH
were
55
.
3
nmol
/

and

,
respectively
.

The
prevalence
of

(

was

9
%
,
with
34

in

and
47
.
8
%
in
women
.

After
accounting
for
confounding
factors
and
serum
PTH
,
a
10
nmol
/
l
higher
serum
25
(
OH
)
D
level
was
associated
with
a
10
%
lower
risk
of
MetS
(

)
.

Furthermore
,
participants
with
vitamin
D
sufficiency
had
a
35
%
lower
risk
of
MetS
than
those
with
vitamin
D
deficiency
(

)
.

PTH
was
not
associated
with
the
risk
of
MetS
after
adjustment
for
confounding
factors
.

These
results
were
confirmed
in
both
men
and
women
.

Thus
in
this
cohort
of
Chinese
individuals
,
vitamin
D
deficiency
is
common
and
optimal
vitamin
D
level
is
inversely
associated
with
MetS
,
independent
of
several
confounders
and
PTH
level
.

The
clinical

of
these
findings

This
study
of
five
patients
with
neonatal
epileptic
encephalopathy
suggests
that
the

is
true
in

Cerebrospinal

analyses
indicated
reduced

Seizures
ceased
with
the

of

to
treatment
with

,
suggesting
a
defect
of
pyridox

(

.

Sequencing
of

gene
identified

showed
that
the
splice

and
stop

were
null

and
that
the

markedly
reduced

Maintenance
of

These

been
shown
that
by
decreasing

cutaneous
melanomas
which
have
a
high
mortality
.

Human
normal
melanocytes
and
melanoma
cells
were
treated
with
BNCT
at
different
boronophenylalanine
concentrations
for
signaling
pathways
analysis
.

BNCT
induced
few
morphological
alterations
in
normal
melanocytes
,
with
a
negligible
increase
in
free
radical
production
.

Melanoma
cells
treated
with
BNCT
showed
significant
extracellular
matrix
(
ECM
)
changes
and
a
significant
cyclin
D1
decrease
,
suggesting
cell
death
by
necrosis
and
apoptosis
and
cell
cycle
arrest
,
respectively
.

BNCT
also
induced
a
significant
increase
in
cleaved
caspase-3
and
a
decrease
in
the
mitochondrial
electrical
potential
with
selectivity
for
melanoma
cells
.

Normal
melanocytes
had
no
significant
differences
due
to
BNCT
treatment
,
confirming
the
data
from
the
literature
regarding
the
selectivity
of
BNCT
.

The
results
from
this
study
suggest
that
some
signaling
pathways
are
involved
in
human
melanoma
treatment
by
BNCT
,
such
as
cell
cycle
arrest
,
ECM
changes
and
intrinsic
apoptosis
.
The

Despite
cyclopenta-fused
polycyclic
aromatic
hydrocarbons
(
CP-PAHs
)
having
been
detected
in
the
environment
,
the
ability
of
these
compounds
to
induce
cellular
and
tissue
responses
remains
poorly
characterized
.

In
this
review
,
we
look
at
the
chemistry
and
biological
activity
of
the
cyclopenta
[
c
]
phenanthrenes
(
CP
[
c
]
Ph
)
as
potential
chemicals
of
concern
in
the
process
of
risk
assessment
.

The
first
part
of
the
review
deals
with
the
environmental
occurrence
and
chemistry
of
CP-PAHs
,
focusing
on
available
methods
of
CP
[
c
]
Ph
chemical
synthesis
.

The
most
interesting
structural
feature
of
the
CP
[
c
]
Ph
is
the
presence
of
a
pseudo
fjord-region
constructed
by
the
cyclopentane
ring
.

This
compound
can
be
treated
either
as
a
structurally
similar
one
to
B
[
c
]
Ph
,
or
as
a
phenanthrene
skeleton
with
an
electrodonating
alkyl
substituent
in
the
bay-region
of
the
molecule
.

The
second
thread
,
providing
available
data
on
the
adverse
effects
of
CP
[
c
]
Ph
compounds
on
cells
and
tissues
of
living
organisms
,
mainly
fish
,
improves
our
understanding
of
these
possible
environmental
hazards
.

The
data
show
that
CP
[
c
]
Ph
is
less
potent
at
inducing
CYP1A
gene
expression
in
rainbow
trout
than
benzo
[
a
]
pyrene
(
B
[
a
]
P
)
,
a
well-known
Ah-receptor
agonist
.

Interestingly
,
the
CP
[
c
]
Ph
dependent
up-regulation
of
CYP1A
mRNA
is
positively
correlated
with
the
incidences
of
clastogenic
changes
in
rainbow
trout
erythrocytes
.

CP
[
c
]
Ph
has
,
comparably
to
B
[
a
]
P
,
a
potential
to
repress
expression
of
tumor
suppressor
p53
,
in
the
head
kidney
of
rainbow
trout
.

Furthermore
,
estrogen
responsive
genes
in
fish
liver
,
ERα
and
VTG
,
are
not
induced
by
CP
[
c
]
Ph
,
suggesting
that
the
compound
has
no
endocrine
disrupting
potential
.

However
,
some
CP
[
c
]
Phs
show
mutagenic
activity
when
investigated
in
the
Ames
test
,
and
exhibit
genotoxic
properties
in
in
vitro
micronucleus
assay
.

The
above
characteristics
suggest
that
CP-PAHs
are
chemicals
of
concern
for
which
potential
pathways
of
exposure
should
be
further
identified
.
There
was
a
time
gap
of
over
40
years
between
the
demonstrated
oral
effectiveness
of
acetazolamide
in
lowering
the
intraocular
pressure
(
IOP
)
of
glaucoma
patients
and
the
introduction
of
a
topical
carbonic
anhydrase
(
CA
)
inhibitor
.

This
is
due
to
the
fact
that
CA-II
,
the
isoenzyme
which
most
likely
plays
an
important
role
in
the
production
of
aqueous
humor
in
humans
,
must
be
essentially
inhibited
by
100%
to
elicit
a
pharmacological
response
.

The
lack
of
success
with
earlier
attempts
to
obtain
a
topical
agent
stems
from
an
inability
to
attain
and
maintain
a
sufficiently
high
intraocular
concentration
of
drug
to
achieve
the
required
inhibition
of
CA
.

Dorzolamide
and
brinzolamide
are
two
topical
CA
inhibitors
which
are
currently
available
to
treat
ocular
hypertension
and
/
or
glaucoma
.

Dorzolamide
is
a
very
potent
inhibitor
of
CA-II
and
its
site
of
action
is
local
within
the
eye
.

Like
oral
CA
inhibitors
,
topically
applied
dorzolamide
lowers
IOP
by
decreasing
the
production
of
aqueous
humor
.

The
drug
is
used
in
monotherapy
as
a
2%
solution
administered
three
times
daily
.

Its
ocular
hypotensive
effect
is
comparable
to
that
of
timolol
at
peak
but
is
somewhat
less
at
trough
.

The
IOP
lowering
effect
of
timolol
is
enhanced
by
the
twice
daily
administration
of
2%
dorzolamide
either
concomitantly
or
in
combination
.

Topically
applied
dorzolamide
is
generally
well
tolerated
and
had
a
low
drop-out
rate
in
clinical
studies
.

The
most
frequent
ocular
adverse
experience
is
burning
and
/
or
stinging
.

Corneal
and
lenticular
problems
have
generally
not
been
encountered
with
long-term
therapy
with
dorzolamide
.

Topically
applied
dorzolamide
penetrates
directly
to
the
posterior
segment
of
the
eye
and
its
presence
is
consistent
with
the
initial
report
that
dorzolamide
increases
retinal
blood
flow
velocity
in
patients
with
normal
tension
glaucoma
.

The
most
frequent
systemic
adverse
experience
is
a
transient
bitter
taste
.

Biochemical
changes
indicative
of
the
systemic
inhibition
of
CA
have
not
been
observed
in
monotherapy
studies
lasting
up
to
2
years
.

This
is
in
harmony
with
the
inability
of
dorzolamide
at
steady-state
to
saturate
CA
in
the
red
blood
cell
and
the
failure
to
detect
its
presence
in
plasma
.

A
1%
suspension
of
brinzolamide
is
comparable
to
2%
dorzolamide
in
lowering
IOP
,
both
drugs
being
administered
three
times
daily
.

Although
brinzolamide
has
a
lower
incidence
of
burning
/
stinging
,
it
elicits
more
blurred
vision
.
We
hypothesized
that
hypoxia
induced
testicular
damage
is
mediated
by
an
activated
NADPH
oxidase
(
NOX
)
,
therefore
,
APO
(
apocynin
)
an
inhibitor
of
NOX
and
raisanberine
(
RS
)
,
a
calcium
influx
inhibitor
were
tested
if
they
could
attenuate
hypoxic
toxicity
to
the
testis
.

Male
Sprague-Dawley
rats
were
exposed
to
hypoxia
(
10±0
.
5%
O2
)
for
17d
and
intervened
with
APO
and
RS
in
the
last
6d
.

Histological
changes
and
expression
of
pro-inflammation
factors
were
evaluated
in
vivo
.

Biomarkers
in
isolated
Leydig
cells
incubated
with
H2O2
were
also
assayed
in
vitro
.

Hypoxic
rats
displayed
lower
serum
testosterone
and
higher
LH
and
FSH
.

Upregulation
of
p22
/
p47
(
phox
)
,
NOX2
,
MMP9
,
PERK
and
p66Shc
was
associated
with
downregulation
of
StAR
,
3β-HSD
and
Cx43
in
the
hypoxia
testis
,
revealed
by
Western
blot
and
immunohistochemical
assay
,
respectively
.

APO
and
RS
at
least
partially
normalize
hypoxia
caused
male
hypogonadism
by
suppressing
ER
stress
,
and
p66Shc
in
testes
.
The
expression
of
P-gp
increases
from
proximal
to
distal
parts
of
the
small
intestine
,
whereas
for
P450
enzymes
the
expression
is
reported
to
be
highest
in
duodenum
and
jejunum
,
decreasing
to
more
distal
sites
.

To
evaluate
to
what
extent
the
regional
differences
in
expression
of
P-gp
and
P450
enzymes
affect
the
absorption
of
a
dual
substrate
,
we
investigated
the
transport
of
darunavir
across
different
small
intestinal
segments
(
duodenum
,
proximal
jejunum
and
ileum
)
.

Moreover
,
the
effect
of
ketoconazole
on
the
intestinal
absorption
of
darunavir
was
explored
,
since
these
drugs
are
commonly
co-administered
.

Performing
the
rat
in
situ
intestinal
perfusion
technique
with
mesenteric
blood
sampling
,
we
found
no
significant
differences
in
the
transport
of
darunavir
at
the
different
intestinal
segments
.

The
involvement
of
P-gp
in
the
absorption
of
darunavir
was
clearly
shown
by
coperfusion
of
darunavir
with
the
P-gp
inhibitor
zosuquidar
.

In
presence
of
zosuquidar
,
a
2
.
2-
,
4
.
2-
and
5
.
7-fold
increase
in
Papp
values
were
measured
for
duodenum
,
proximal
jejunum
and
ileum
,
respectively
.

Involvement
of
P450
mediated
metabolism
in
the
absorption
of
darunavir
could
not
be
demonstrated
in
this
rat
model
.

Upon
studying
the
drug-drug
interaction
of
darunavir
with
ketoconazole
,
data
were
indicative
for
an
inhibitory
effect
of
ketoconazole
on
P-gp
as
the
main
mechanism
for
the
increased
transport
of
darunavir
across
the
small
intestine
.
Although
angiogenesis
and
osteogenesis
are
critically
linked
,
the
importance
of
angiogenesis
for
stress
fracture
healing
is
unknown
.

In
this
study
,
mechanical
loading
was
used
to
create
a
non-displaced
stress
fracture
in
the
adult
rat
forelimb
.

Fumagillin
,
an
anti-angiogenic
agent
,
was
used
as
the
water
soluble
analogue
TNP-470
(
25mg
/
kg
)
as
well
as
incorporated
into
lipid-encapsulated
α
(
v
)
β
(
3
)
integrin
targeted
nanoparticles
(
0
.
25mg
/
kg
)
.

In
the
first
experiment
,
TNP-470
was
administered
daily
for
5
days
following
mechanical
loading
,
and
changes
in
gene
expression
,
vascularity
,
and
woven
bone
formation
were
quantified
.

Although
no
changes
in
vascularity
were
detected
3
days
after
loading
,
treatment-related
downregulation
of
angiogenic
(
Pecam1
)
and
osteogenic
(
Bsp
,
Osx
)
genes
was
observed
at
this
early
time
point
.

On
day
7
,
microCT
imaging
of
loaded
limbs
revealed
diminished
woven
bone
formation
in
treated
limbs
compared
to
vehicle
treated
limbs
.

In
the
second
experiment
,
α
(
v
)
β
(
3
)
integrin
targeted
fumagillin
nanoparticles
were
administered
as
before
,
albeit
with
a
100-fold
lower
dose
,
and
changes
in
vascularity
and
woven
bone
formation
were
determined
.

There
were
no
treatment-related
changes
in
vessel
count
or
volume
3
days
after
loading
,
although
fewer
angiogenic
(
CD105
positive
)
blood
vessels
were
present
in
treated
limbs
compared
to
vehicle
treated
limbs
.

This
result
manifested
on
day
7
as
a
reduction
in
total
vascularity
,
as
measured
by
histology
(
vessel
count
)
and
microCT
(
vessel
volume
)
.

Similar
to
the
first
experiment
,
treated
limbs
had
diminished
woven
bone
formation
on
day
7
compared
to
vehicle
treated
limbs
.

These
results
indicate
that
angiogenesis
is
required
for
stress
fracture
healing
,
and
may
have
implications
for
inducing
rapid
repair
of
stress
fractures
.
The
aim
of
this
work
was
to
identify
mechanisms
and
potential
biomarkers
for
predicting
the
development
and
progression
of
aflatoxin
B1
(
AFB1
)
-induced
acute
hepatotoxicity
.

In
this
study
,
microarray
analysis
and
metabolites
profiles
were
used
to
identify
shifts
in
gene
expression
and
metabolite
levels
associated
with
the
affected
physiological
processes
of
rats
treated
with
AFB1
.

Histopathological
examinations
and
serum
biochemical
analysis
were
simultaneously
performed;
the
results
indicated
that
hepatotoxicity
occurred
in
higher
dosage
groups
.

However
,
gene
expression
analysis
and
metabolite
profiles
are
more
sensitive
than
general
toxicity
studies
for
detecting
AFB1-induced
acute
hepatotoxicity
as
the
patterns
of
low-dose
AFB1-treated
rats
in
these
two
technique
platforms
were
more
similar
to
the
rats
in
higher
dosage
groups
than
to
the
control
rats
.

Integrated
analysis
of
the
results
from
general
toxicity
studies
,
transcriptomics
and
metabonomics
profiles
suggested
that
p53
signaling
pathway
induced
by
oxidative
damage
was
the
crucial
step
in
AFB1-induced
acute
hepatotoxicity
,
whereas
gluconeogenesis
and
lipid
metabolism
disorder
were
found
to
be
the
major
metabolic
effects
after
acute
AFB1
exposure
.

The
genes
and
metabolites
significantly
affected
in
common
in
rat
liver
or
serum
of
three
doses
AFB1
treatments
served
as
potential
biomarkers
for
detecting
AFB1-induced
acute
hepatotoxicity
.

Abstract
Several
studies
report
that
endocrine
disrupting
chemicals
(
EDC
)
able
to
interfere
with
endocrine
homeostasis
may
affect
women's
reproductive
health
.

We
analyzed
EDC
serum
levels
and
nuclear
receptors
(
NRs
)
expression
in
order
to
have
an
indication
of
the
internal
dose
of
biologically
active
compounds
and
a
measurement
of
indicators
of
their
effects
,
as
a
result
of
the
repeated
uptake
from
environmental
source
.

The
percentage
of
patients
with
detectable
bisphenol
A
(
BPA
)
concentrations
was
significantly
higher
in
the
infertile
patients
compared
with
fertile
subjects
.

No
significant
difference
was
found
between
the
groups
with
regard
to
perfluorooctane
sulfonate
(
PFOS
)
,
perfluorooctanoic
acid
(
PFOA
)
,
mono-ethylhexyl
phthalate
(
MEHP
)
and
di-
(
2-ethylhexyl
)
phthalate
(
DEHP
)
concentrations
.

Among
infertile
women
,
the
mean
expression
of
estrogen
receptor
alpha
(
ERα
)
and
beta
(
Erβ
)
,
androgen
receptor
(
AR
)
and
pregnane
X
receptor
(
PXR
)
was
significantly
higher
than
fertile
patients
.

The
mean
expression
of
aryl
hydrocarbon
receptor
(
AhR
)
and
peroxisome
proliferator-activated
receptor
gamma
(
PPARγ
)
did
not
show
significant
differences
between
two
groups
.

Patients
with
endometriosis
had
higher
levels
of
PPARγ
than
all
women
with
other
causes
of
infertility
.

This
study
led
further
support
to
EDC
exposure
as

HSP90

Due
to
their
role
in
the
metabolism
of
monoamine
neurotransmitters
,
MAO-A
and
MAO-B
present
a
significant
pharmacological
interest
.

For
instance
the
inhibitors
of
human
MAO-B
are
considered
useful
tools
for
the
treatment
of
Parkinson
Disease
.

Therefore
,
the
rational
design
and
synthesis
of
new
MAOs
inhibitors
is
considered
of
great
importance
for
the
development
of
new
and
more
effective
treatments
of
Parkinson
Disease
.

In
this
work
,
Quantitative
Structure
Activity
Relationships
(
QSAR
)
has
been
developed
to
predict
the
human
MAO
inhibitory
activity
and
selectivity
.

The
first
step
was
the
selection
of
a
suitable
dataset
of
heterocyclic
compounds
that
include
chromones
,
coumarins
,
chalcones
,
thiazolylhydrazones
,
etc
.

These
compounds
were
previously
synthesized
in
one
of
our
laboratories
,
or
elsewhere
,
and
their
activities
measured
by
the
same
assays
and
for
the
same
laboratory
staff
.

Applying
linear
discriminant
analysis
to
data
derived
from
a
variety
of
molecular
representations
and
feature
selection
algorithms
,
reliable
QSAR
models
were
built
which
could
be
used
to
predict
for
test
compounds
the
inhibitory
activity
and
selectivity
toward
human
MAO
.

This
work
also
showed
how
several
QSAR
models
can
be
combined
to
make
better
predictions
.

The
final
models
exhibit
significant
statistics
,
interpretability
,
as
well
as
displaying
predictive
power
on
an
external
validation
set
made
up
of
chromone
derivatives
with
unknown
activity
(
that
are
being
reported
here
for
first
time
)
synthesized
by
our
group
,
and
coumarins
recently
reported
in
the
literature

Aldo-keto
reductases
(
AKRs
)
metabolize
a
wide
range
of
substrates
,
including
polycyclic
aromatic
hydrocarbons
(
PAHs
)
,
generating
metabolites
(
o-quinones
)
and
reactive
oxygen
species
(
ROS
)
,
which
are
capable
of
initiating
and
promoting
carcinogenesis
.

Exposure
to
PAHs
,
their
metabolites
,
and
ROS
further
increase
AKRs
isoform
expression
that
may
amplify
oxidative
damage
.

Human
AKR
enzymes
are
highly
polymorphic
,
and
allelic
variants
may
contribute
to
different
AKRs
expression
in
individuals
.

Despite
the
importance
of
AKRs
in
PAHs
metabolism
,
there
are
no
studies
that
evaluate
,
in
general
human
populations
,
the
effect
of
PAHs
on
AKRs
expression
in
peripheral
blood
lymphocytes
(
PBLs
)
.

The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
determine
the
effect
of
tobacco
smoke
exposure
,
and
AKR1A1*2
and
AKR1C3*2
polymorphisms
,
on
AKR1A1
and
AKR1C1-AKR1C3
messenger
RNA
(
mRNA
)
levels
in
PBLs
from
smokers
.

In
the
smoker
group
,
there
is
a
statistically
significant
positive
association
between
AKR1A1
,
AKR1C1
,
and
AKR1C3
mRNA
induction
and
urine
cotinine
levels
in
individuals
with
a
body
mass
index
(
BMI
)
less
than
25
.

However
,
AKR1A1*2
and
AKR1C3*2
alleles
did
not
influence
AKR1A1
and
AKR1C1-AKR1C3
mRNA
levels
.

These
results
suggest
that
AKRs
induction
by
PAHs
in
smokers'
PBLs
is
associated
with
BMI;
therefore
,
the
role
of
adipose
tissue
accumulation
in
PAHs'
effects
needs
further
investigation
.

cation
channels
involved
in
fast
signal
transduction
in
many
cell
types
.

In
this
study
,
we
used
homology
modeling
of
the
rat
P2X2
receptor
with
the
zebrafish
P2X4
X-ray
template
to
determine
that
the
side
chains
of
the
Glu167
and
Arg290
residues
are
in
close
spatial
vicinity
within
the
ATP-binding
pocket
when
the
rat
P2X2
channel
is
closed
.

Through
charge
reversal
mutation
analysis
and
mutant
cycle
analysis
,
we
obtained
evidence
that
Glu167
and
Arg290
form
an
electrostatic
interaction
.

In
addition
,
disulfide
trapping
indicated
the
close
proximity
of
Glu167
and
Arg290
when
the
channel
is
in
the
closed
state
,
but
not
in
the
ATP-bound
open
state
.

Consistent
with
a
gating-induced
movement
that
disrupts
the
Glu167
/
Arg290
salt
bridge
,
a
comparison
of
the
closed
and
open
rat
P2X2
receptor
models
revealed
a
significant
rearrangement
of
the
protein
backbone
and
the
side
chains
of
the
Glu167
and
Arg290
residues
during
the
closed-to-open
transition
.

The
associated
release
of
the
Glu167
/
Arg290
salt
bridge
during
channel
opening
allows
a
strong
ionic
interaction
between
Arg290
and
a
γ-phosphate
oxygen
of
ATP
.

We
conclude
from
these
results
that
the
state-dependent
salt
bridge
switching
from
Arg290
/
Glu167
to
Arg290
/
ATP
fulfills
a
dual
role
:
to
destabilize
the
closed
state
of
the
receptor
and
to
promote
the
ionic
coordination
of
ATP
in
the
ATP-binding
pocket

Cytoplasmic
polyadenylation
element
binding
protein
(
CPEB
)
provides
temporal
and
spatial
control
of
protein
synthesis
required
for
early
development
and
neuronal
synaptic
plasticity
.

CPEB
regulates
protein
expression
by
inhibiting
polyadenylation
of
selected
mRNA
transcripts
,
which
prevents
binding
of
the
ribosome
for
protein
synthesis
.

Two
RNA
recognition
motif
domains
and
a
C-terminal
binuclear
zinc-binding
domain
are
required
for
mRNA
binding
,
but
the
zinc-binding
domain
is
not
required
for
sequence-specific
recognition
of
the
targeted
mRNA
transcript
.

The
structure
and
function
of
the
zinc-binding
domain
of
CPEB
are
unknown
.

The
C-terminal
region
of
CPEB
may
participate
in
assembly
of
the
ribonucleoprotein
complex
that
includes
the
scaffold
protein
,
Symplekin
,
and
the
cleavage
and
polyadenylation
specificity
factor
.

Sumoylation
of
Symplekin
is
required
for
polyadenylation
,
and
both
cleavage
and
polyadenylation
specificity
factor
and
poly
(
A
)
polymerase
are
sumoylated
.

The
foreshortened
poly
(
A
)
tail
is
maintained
by
poly
(
A
)
ribonuclease
,
which
associates
with
CPEB
.

While
zinc-binding
domains
are
renowned
for
nucleic
acid
recognition
,
binuclear
zinc-binding
structural
motifs
,
such
as
LIM
(
Lin-11
,
Isl-1
,
Mec-3
)
,
RING
(
really
interesting
new
gene
)
,
PHD
(
plant
homeodomain
)
and
ZZ
(
ZZ-type
zinc
finger
)
domains
,
participate
in
protein-protein
interactions
.

Here
,
we
report
the
solution
structure
of
the
C-terminal
zinc-binding
domain
of
CPEB1
(
CPEB1-ZZ
)
,
which
has
a
cross-braced
zinc
binding
topology
.

The
structural
similarity
to
other
ZZ
domains
suggests
that
the
CPEB1-ZZ
domain
recruits
sumoylated
proteins
during
assembly
of
the
ribonucleoprotein
complex
prior
to
mRNA
export
from
the

Hypothyroidism
has
a
variety
of
adverse
effects
on
cognitive
function
.

The
treatment
of
levothyroxine
alone
cannot
restore
cognitive
defects
of
hypothyroid
patients
.

Antioxidant
vitamin
E
supplementation
could
be
useful
in
disturbances
which
are
associated
with
oxidative
stress
and
could
effectively
slow
the
progression
of
Alzheimer
disease
.

Thus
,
the
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
evaluate
oxidative
stress
status
of
the
serum
and
hippocampus
in
hypothyroidism
and
to
examine
the
effects
of
levothyroxine
replacement
therapy
with
vitamin
E
supplementation
on
cognitive
deficit
.

Sprague-Dawley
rats
were
randomly
divided
into
five
groups
:
control
group
,
PTU
group
,
PTU
+
Vit
E
group
,
PTU
+
L-T4
group
,
and
PTU
+
L-T4
+
Vit
E
group
.

Serum
and
hippocampus
malondialdehyde
(
MDA
)
levels
were
determined
using
the
thiobarbituric-acid
reactive
substances
method
.

Serum
and
hippocampus
superoxide
dismutase
(
SOD
)
levels
were
determined
by
measuring
its
ability
to
inhibit
the
photoreduction
of
nitroblue
tetrazolium
.

Learning
and
memory
was
assessed
by
Morris
water
maze
test
.

In
the
present
study
,
we
found
that
the
rats
of
PTU
+
Vit
E
group
spent
less
time
to
find
the
platform
on
days
2
,
3
,
4
,
and
5
than
the
PTU
group
.

Moreover
,
the
rats
of
PTU
+
L-T4
+
Vit
E
group
spent
less
time
to
find
the
platform
on
days
4
and
5
than
the
PTU
+
L-T4
group
.

The
time
spent
in
the
target
quadrants
was
measured
in
the
probe
test
and
no
difference
was
observed
in
all
groups
.

Oxidative
damage
has
been
observed
in
the
serum
and
hippocampus
of
hypothyroidism
rat
.

SOD
levels
of
serum
and
hippocampus
tissue
were
significantly
increased
and
MDA
levels
were
significantly
decreased
in
the
PTU
+
Vit
E
and
PTU
+
L-T4
+
Vit
E
groups
than
the
PTU
and
PTU
+
L-T4
groups
.

Therefore
,
these
findings
indicate
that
levothyroxine
replacement
therapy
with
vitamin
E
supplementation
may
ameliorate
cognitive
deficit
in
PTU-induced
hypothyroidism
through
the
decrease
of
oxidative
stress
status
.

Inflammatory
activation
of

particles
can
be
facilitated
via
Toll-like
receptors
(
TLR
)
.

The
action
of
TLR
agonists
and
antagonists
has
been
reported
to
depend
on
the
formation
of
nanoparticulate
structures
.

Aim
of
the
present
study
was
to
identify
the
signaling
pathways
induced
by
nanoparticulate
structures
in
human
macrophages
,
which
might
be
critical
for
inflammatory
cell
activation
.

METHODS
:
Studies
were
performed
in
primary
human
alveolar
macrophages
or
in
differentiated
THP-1
macrophages
.

Silica
nanoparticles
were
prepared
by
Stöber
synthesis
and
characterized
by
dynamic
light
scattering
and
scanning
electron

.

Mycobacterial
DNA
was
isolated
from
Mycobacterium

BCG
,
and
nanoparticle
formation
was
assessed
by
atomic
force
microscopy
and
dynamic
light
scattering
.

Actin
polymerization
was
measured
by
phalloidin-TRITC
staining
,
and
cell
activation
was
determined
by
reverse
transcription
quantitative
PCR
analysis
,
L929
cytotoxicity
assay
(
cytokine
induction
)
,
and
pull-down
assays
(
Rho

)
.

RESULTS
:
In
contrast
to
immune
stimulatory
sequence
ISS
1018
,
BCG
DNA
spontaneously
formed
nanoparticulate
structures
and
induced
actin
polymerization
as
did
synthetic
silica
nanoparticles
.

Co-incubation
with
silica
nanoparticles
amplified
the
responsiveness
of
macrophages
toward
the
TLR9
ligand

1018
.

The
activation
of
Rac1
was
induced
by
silica
nanoparticles
as
well
as
BCG
DNA
and
is
suggested
as
the
critical
signaling
event
inducing
both
cytoskeleton
changes
as
well
as
inflammatory
cell
activation
.

CONCLUSION
:
Nanoparticles
can
induce
signaling
pathways
,
which
amplify
an

showed
a

a
partial
reduction
in

were
not

The
affinity

was
evaluated
by
utilizing
membranes
from

,
respectively
.

5-Methylurapidil
and
phentolamine
were
confirmed
as
selective
for
the
alpha

,
whereas
spiperone
was
alpha

A
significant

was
found
between
the
pA2

their
affinity
for

subtype
,

not
for

.

In
conclusion
,
these
findings
indicate
that
in
rat
aorta
most
of
the
contraction
is
mediated
by
alpha
1B-adrenoceptors
,
and
that
the
potency
(

of
an

be
related

its

We
investigate
the
topological
surface
state
properties
at
various
surface
cleaves
in
the
topological
insulator
Bi2Se3
,
via
first
principles
calculations
and
scanning
tunneling
microscopy
/
spectroscopy
(
STM
/
STS
)
.

While
the
typical
surface
termination
occurs
between
two
quintuple
layers
,
we
report
the
existence
of
a
surface
termination
within
a
single
quintuple
layer
where
dangling
bonds
form
with
giant
spin
splitting
owing
to
strong
spin-orbit
coupling
.

Unlike
Rashba
split
states
in
a
2D
electron
gas
,
these
states
are
constrained
by
the
band
topology
of
the
host
insulator
with
topological
properties
similar
to
the
typical
topological
surface
state
,
and
thereby
offer
an
alternative
candidate
for
spintronics
usage
.

We
name
these
new
states
"topological
dangling-bond
states"
.

The
degree
of
the
spin
polarization
of
these
states
is
greatly
enhanced
.

Since
dangling
bonds
are
more
chemically
reactive
,
the
observed
topological
dangling-bond
states
provide
a
new
avenue
for
manipulating
band
dispersions
and
spin-textures
by

inflammasome
in

,
little
is
known
about
the
ex
vivo
profile
of
inflammasome
activation
in

2
diabetic
patients
.

In
this
study
,
we
investigated
patterns
of
NLRP3
inflammasome
activation
in
monocyte-derived
macrophages
(
MDMs
)
from
drug-naïve
patients
with
newly
diagnosed
type

diabetes
.

Type
2
diabetic
subjects
had
significantly
increased
mRNA
and
protein
expression
of
NLRP3
,
apoptosis-associated
speck-like
protein
containing
a
CARD

ASC
)
,
and
proinflammatory

compared
with
healthy
controls
.

Upregulated
interleukin

IL

-1β
maturation
,
IL-18
secretion
,
and
caspase-1
cleavage
were
observed
in
MDMs
from
type

diabetic
patients
after
stimulation
with
various
danger
molecules
(
ATP

,

,

)
.

Mitochondrial
reactive
oxygen
species
and
NLRP3
were
required
for
IL-1β
synthesis
in
MDMs
.

Finally
,
2
months
of
therapy
with
the
antidiabetic
drug
metformin
significantly
inhibited
the
maturation
of
IL-1β
in
MDMs
from
patients
with
type
2
diabetes
through
AMP-activated
protein
kinase
(
AMPK
)
activation
.

Taken
together
,
these
data
suggest
that
NLRP3
inflammasome
activation
is
elevated
in
myeloid
cells
from
type
2
diabetic
patients
and
that
antidiabetic
treatment
with
metformin
contributes
to
modulation
of
inflammasome
activation
in
type

diabetes
.
The
adenosine
triphosphate
binding
cassette
(
ABC
)
-transporter
ABCC2
(
MRP2
/
cMOAT
)
can
mediate
resistance
against
the
commonly
used
anticancer
drugs
cisplatin
and
paclitaxel
.

To
overcome
the
ABCC2-depending
drug
resistance
,
two
specific
anti-ABCC2
small
interfering
RNAs
(
siRNAs
)
were
designed
for
transient
triggering
of
the
gene-silencing
RNA
interference
(
RNAi
)
pathway
in
the
cisplatin-resistant
human
ovarian
carcinoma
cell
line
A2780RCIS
.

Since
both
siRNAs
showed
biological
activity
,
for
stable
inhibition
of
ABCC2
a
corresponding
short
hairpin
RNA
(
shRNA
)
-encoding
expression
vector
was
designed
.

By
treatment
of
A2780RCIS
cells
with
this
construct
,
the
expressions
of
the
targeted
ABCC2
encoding
mRNA
and
transport
protein
were
inhibited
.

These
effects
were
accompanied
by
reversal
of
resistance
against
cisplatin
and
paclitaxel
.

Thus
,
the
data
demonstrate
the
utility
of
the
analyzed
RNAs
as
powerful
laboratory
tools
and
indicate
that
siRNA-
and
shRNA-mediated
RNAi-based
gene
therapeutic
approaches
may
be
applicable
in
preventing
and
reversing
ABCC2-depending
drug
resistance

Cilostazol

The
anti-platelet

properties
of
cilostazol
have
been
extensively
characterized
and
considered
to
contribute
to
the
variety
of
clinical

as
intermittent

In
this

,
the
novel

of
cilostazol
are
overviewed
with
the
focus
on
the
action
of
cilostazol
in
in

studies
as

fragmentation
,
all
of
which
were
antagonized
by
iberiotoxin
,
a
maxi-K
(
+
)
channel
blocker
.

Further
,
cilostazol
prevented
TNF-alpha-induced
PTEN
phosphorylation
and
apoptotic
cell
death
via
increased
CK2
phosphorylation
in
the
SK-N-SH
cells
.

Cilostazol
increased
K
(
+
)
current
in
SK-N-SH
cells
by
opening
the
maxi-K
channels
.

Thus
,
it
was
suggested
that
the
action
of
cilostazol
to
promote
cell
survival
was
ascribed
to
the
maxi-K
channel
opening-coupled
upregulation
of
CK2
phosphorylation
and
downregulation
of
PTEN
phosphorylation
with
resultant
increased
phosphorylation
of
Akt
and
CREB
.

These
in
vitro
data
were
confirmed
in
the
in
vivo
results
of
rats
subjected
to

damage

In
clinical
cardiology
,
resort
has
recently
been
made
to
molecular
genetics
in
order
to
explain
some
mechanisms
that
underlie
sudden
cardiac
death
in
young
people
with
structurally
normal
hearts
.

It
has
become
evident
that
genetic
mutations
regarding
cardiac
ion
channels
may
disrupt
the
delicate
balance
of
currents
in
the
action
potential
,
thus
inducing
malignant
ventricular
tachyarrhythmias
.

The
cardiac
sodium
channel
gene
,
SCN5A
,
is
involved
in
two
of
such
arrhythmogenic
diseases
,
the
Brugada
syndrome
and
one
form
of
the
long
QT
syndrome
(
LQT3
)
.

It
is
believed
that
these
syndromes
result
from
opposite
molecular
effects
:
Brugada
syndrome
mutations
cause
a
reduced
sodium
current
,
while
LQT3
mutations
are
associated
with
a
gain
of
function
.

The
effects
of
class
I
antiarrhythmic
drugs
have
been
used
to
differentiate
these
diseases
.

Intravenous
flecainide
is
used
as
a
highly
specific
test
to
unmask
the
electrocardiographic
phenotype
of
the
Brugada
syndrome
.

On
the
other
hand
,
on
the
basis
of
experimental
and
clinical
studies
,
the
possibility
that
the
same
drugs
act
as
a
gene-specific
therapy
in
this
disorder
by
contrasting
the
effect
of
mutations
in
LQT3
has
been
explored
.

Recent
evidence
shows
that
phenotypic
overlap
may
exist
between
the
Brugada
syndrome
and
LQT3
.

One
large
family
with
a
SCN5A
mutation
and
a
"mixed"
electrocardiographic
pattern
(
prolonged
QT
interval
and
ST-segment
elevation
)
has
been
reported
.

Moreover
,
our
recent
data
showed
that
flecainide
challenge
may
elicit
ST-segment
elevation
in
some
LQT3
patients
.

The
presence
of
"intermediate"
phenotypes
highlights
a
remarkable
heterogeneity
suggesting
that
clinical
features
may
depend
upon
the
single
mutation
.

Only
deepened
understanding
of
the
genotype-phenotype
correlation
will
allow
the
definition
of
the
individual
patient's
risk
and
the
development
of
guidelines
for
clinical
management
.

was
to

A
total
of
60
adult

rats
were
randomly
divided
into
five
groups
(
12
rats
each
)
:
group
I
serves
as
the
control
group
.

Rats
in
groups
(
II-V
)
were
administrated
intragastrically
a
single
dose
of
50
mg
/
kg
body
weight
(
bw
)
of
DMBA
.

A
day
after
DMBA
administration
,
rats
in
group
III
were
injected
intraperitoneally
(
ip
)
with
100
mg
2-deoxyglucose
(
2-DG
)
/
kg
bw
daily
.

Rats
in
group
IV
were
injected

with
10
mg

.

Rats
in
group
V
were
injected

with
100
mg
2-DG
/
kg
bw
and
10
mg
sodium
malonate
/
kg
bw
(
treatment
for
90
days
)
.

The
results
obtained
showed
that
DMBA
induced
oxidative
stress
by
decreasing
the
activities
of
glutathione
reductase
(
GRase
)
and
superoxide
dismutase
(
SOD
)
,
glutathione
peroxidase
(
GPx
)
and
elevating
the
levels
of
malondialdehyde
(
MDA
)
and
nitric
oxide
(
NO
)
in
mammary
tissues
when
compared
with
control
.

The
combined
treatment
protected
against
the
previous
deleterious
changes
by
a
significant
elevation
in
the
activities
of
GRase
and
SOD
,
GPx
and
lowering
the
levels
of
MDA
and
NO
more
potentially
when
compared
with
individual
treatment
.

Apoptosis
,
as
indicated
by
a
significant
release
of
cytochrome
c
from
mitochondria
into
the
cytosol
,
observed
in
DMBA-injected
rats
was
positively
significantly
correlated
with
the
elevation
of
the
level
of
NO
.

These
data
explained
the
possible
additive
effect
of
2-DG
and
malonate
by
depleting
the
cell
energy
by
their
protective
effects
against
the
earlier

Perfluorooctane
sulfonate
(
PFOS
)
is
a
widespread
and
persistent
chemical
in
the
environment
.

We
investigated
the
endocrine-disrupting
effects
of
PFOS
using
a
combination
of
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
assays
.

Reporter
gene
assays
were
used
to
detect
receptor-mediated
(
anti-
)
estrogenic
,
(
anti-
)
androgenic
,
and
(
anti-
)
thyroid
hormone
activities
.

The
effect
of
PFOS
on
steroidogenesis
was
assessed
both
at
hormone
levels
in
the
supernatant
and
at
expression
levels
of
hormone-induced
genes
in
the
H295R
cell
.

A
zebrafish-based
short-term
screening
method
was
developed
to
detect
the
effect
of
PFOS
on
endocrine
function
in
vivo
.

The
results
indicate
that
PFOS
can
act
as
an
estrogen
receptor
agonist
and
thyroid
hormone
receptor
antagonist
.

Exposure
to
PFOS
decreased
supernatant
testosterone
(
T
)
,
increased
estradiol
(
E2
)
concentrations
in
H295R
cell
medium
and
altered
the
expression
of
several
genes
involved
in
steroidogenesis
.

In
addition
,
PFOS
increased
early
thyroid
development
gene
(
hhex
and
pax8
)
expression
in
a
concentration-dependent
manner
,
decreased
steroidogenic
enzyme
gene
(
CYP17

CYP19a
,
CYP19b
)
expression
,
and
changed
the

production
genes
(
esr1
,
esr2b
)
after
500
µg
/
L

.

These
results
indicate
that
PFOS
has
the
ability
to
act
as
an
endocrine
disruptor
both
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
by
disrupting
the
function
of
nuclear
hormone
receptors
,
interfering
with
steroidogenesis
,
and
altering

Recently
published
studies
suggest
a
weak
positive
correlation
between
increased
dietary
acrylamide
intake
and
the
increased
risk
of
endometrial
and
ovarian
cancer
.

However
,
risk
assessment
of
acrylamide
remains
difficult
because
the
carcinogenic
mechanisms
are
still
unknown
and
in
particular
the
molecular
effects
of
low
level
acrylamide
exposure
as
seen
by
dietary
intake
are
not
well
understood
.

Therefore
,
we
analyzed
in
ovarian
and
endometrial
cancer
cell
lines
as
well
as
in
primary
hepatocytes
the
expression
of
genes
involved
in
cancer
development

after
high
and
low
dose
exposure
(
1-0
.
001mM
)
of
acrylamide
and
its
metabolite
glycidamide
.

In
conclusion
our
in

results
demonstrate
that
exposure
to
high
doses
of
glycidamide
/
acrylamide
-
exceeding
the
dietary
exposure
of
the
general
population
by
far
-
can
induce
genes
with
growth
promoting
potential
like
the
oncogene

The
acute
reinforcing
effects
of
cocaine
are
thought
by
some
to
result
from
cocaine
binding
to
the
dopamine
(
DA
)
transporter
,
which
inhibits
DA
uptake
and
increases
synaptic
DA
levels
in
the
mesolimbic
system
.

Other
data
suggest
that
neurotransmitters
other
than
DA
contribute
to
cocaine
reinforcement
and
addiction
.

These
considerations
illustrate
the
need
to
have
additional
research
tools
with
which
to
test
the
"DA
hypothesis
.

"
One
strategy
is
to
identify
drugs
which
bind
to
the
DA
transporter
(
DAT
ligands
)
but
which
do
not
inhibit
DA
uptake
as
effectively
as
cocaine
.

The
purpose
of
the
present
study
was
to
identify
members
of
a
novel
structural
class
of
DAT
ligands
and
to
characterize
their
interactions
at
the
DA
transporter
.

A
positional
scanning
hexapeptide
D-amino
acid
library
was
screened
for
inhibition
of
[
(
125
)
I
]
RTI-55
binding
to
rat
caudate
DA
transporters
.

Based
on
the
results
,
12
peptides
were
synthesized
.

All
12
peptides
inhibited
[
(
125
)
I
]
RTI-55
binding
to
DA
transporters
with
IC
(
50
)
values
,
which
ranged
from
1
.
8
microM
to
12
microM
.

The
two
most
potent
peptides
(
TPI-669-1
and
TPI-669-4
)
were
prepared
in
larger
quantities
and
were
characterized
further
for
activity
at
the
DAT
and
5-HT
transporter
.

Both
peptides
inhibited
DA
and
5-HT
uptake
and
transporter
binding
with
IC
(
50
)
/
K
(
i
)
values
in
the
low
micromolar
range
.

In
vivo
microdialysis
studies
demonstrated
that
both
peptides
increase
extracellular
DA
and
5-HT
in
the
nucleus
accumbens
of
rats
.

These
data
demonstrate
that
peptides
can
function
as
inhibitors
of
biogenic
amine
transport
.

Future
work
will
focus
on
developing
more
potent
and
selective
peptides
.

Cathepsins
are
proteases
that
have
been
implicated
in
cancer
progression
.

However
,
there
have
been
few
studies
about
the
association
between
cathepsins
and
estrogenic
chemicals
during
the
cancer
progression
.

In
this
study
,
we
examined
the
effect
(
s
)
of
4-tert-octylphenol
(
OP
)
,
a
potent
EDC
,
on
the
expression
of
cathepsins
B
and
D
in
human
MCF-7
breast
cancer
cells
and
a
xenograft
mouse
model
.

Treatment
with
OP
significantly
induced
the
proliferation
MCF-7
cells
in
an
MTT
assay
.

In
addition
,
the
expression
of
cathepsins
B
and
D
was
markedly
enhanced
in
MCF-7
cells
at
both
the
transcriptional
and
the
translational
levels
following
treatment
with
E2
or
OP
up
to
48h
.

These
results
demonstrated
the
ability
of
OP
to
disrupt
normal
transcriptional
regulation
of
cathepsins
B
and
D
in
human
breast
cancer
cells
.

However
,
the
effects
of
OP
on
cell
growth
or
overexpression
of
cathepsins
by
inhibiting
ER-mediated
signaling
were
abolished
by
an
ER
antagonist
and
siRNA
specific
for
ERα
.

In
conclusion
,
our
findings
suggest
that
OP
at
10
(
-6
)
M
,
like
E2
,
may
accelerate
breast
cancer
cell
proliferation
and
the
expression
of
cathepsins
through
an
ER-mediated
signaling
pathway
.

In
addition
,
the
breast
cancer
cells
exposed
with
OP
to
a
xenograft
mouse
model
were
more
aggressive
according
to
our
histological
analysis
and
showed
markedly
increased
expression
of
cathepsin
B
.

These
effects
of
mouse
model
resulted
in
an
increased
potential
for
metastasis
in
breast
cancer
.

Taken
together
,
we
determined
that
OP
can
adversely
affect
human
health
by
promoting
cancer
proliferation
and
metastasis
through
the
amplification
of
cathepsins
B
and
D
via
the
ER-mediated
signaling
pathway
.
In
1954
,
substances
that
protected
cells
from
viral
infection
were
discovered
and
named
IFN
(
interferon
)
.

This
family
of
cytokines
,
which
were
the
first
to
be
used
in
clinical
therapy
,
is
classified
into
type
I
and
II
IFNs
.

Type
I
mainly
consists
of
IFNalpha
and
IFNbeta
subtypes
,
which
are
structurally
related
and
bind
to
a
common
receptor
.

IFNgamma
,
the
sole
type
II
IFN
,
is
structurally
unrelated
,
binds
to
a
different
receptor
and
,
as
a
dimer
,
strongly
interacts
with
HS
(
heparan
sulphate
)
.

In
addition
to
its
antiviral
activity
,
it
modulates
nearly
all
phases
of
immune
and
inflammatory
responses
.

IFNgamma
binding
to
HS
controls
the
blood
clearance
,
the
subsequent
tissue
targeting
and
the
local
accumulation
of
the
cytokine
.

It
also
regulates
IFNgamma
activity
by
a
unique
mechanism
involving
a
controlled
processing
of
the
C-terminal
peptide
.

The
binding
site
encompasses
an
N-acetylated
glucosamine-rich
domain
separating
two
highly
sulphated
sequences
that
each
binds
to
one
IFNgamma
monomer
.

Based
on
this
template
,
a
set
of
glycoconjugate
mimetics
that
would
mimic
the
IFNgamma
binding
site
has
been
synthesized
.

One
of
these
molecules
displays
high
affinity
for
the
cytokine
and
inhibits
binding
to
both
HS
and
IFNgammaR
(
IFNgamma
receptor
)
,
the
cell-surface
receptor
.

These
results
validate
the
HS
structural
determinants
for
IFNgamma
recognition
,
and
provide
a
new
strategy
to
inhibit
IFNgamma
in
a
number
of
diseases
in
which
the
cytokine
has
been
identified
as
a
target

Archaeal

DNA
polymerase
is
inhibited
by
the
presence
of
uracil
in
DNA
template
strands
.

When
the
enzyme
encounters
uracil
,
following
three
parameters
change
:
DNA
binding
increases
roughly
2-fold
,
the
rate
of
polymerization
slows
by
a
factor
of
∼5
and
3'-5'
proof-reading
exonuclease
activity
is
stimulated
by
a
factor
of
∼2
.

Together
these
changes
result
in
a
significant
decrease
in
polymerization
activity
and
a
reduction
in
net
DNA
synthesis
.

Pol
D
appears
to
interact
with
template
strand
uracil
irrespective
of
its
distance
ahead
of
the
replication
fork
.

Polymerization
does
not
stop
at

location

It
is
proposed
that
Pol
D
is
able
to
interact
with
uracil
by
looping
out
the
single-stranded
template
,
allowing
simultaneous
contact
of
both
the
base
and

Mycobacterium

protein

B
(

)
is
a
virulence
factor
secreted
by
the
pathogen
and
mediates
mycobacterial
survival
in
macrophages
by
targeting
host
cell
immune
responses
.

Consequently
,
mPTPB
represents
an
exciting
new
target
to
combat

)
infection
.

describe

a

)
and
selective
mPTPB
inhibitor
(
>50
fold
against
a
large

)
.

Importantly
,
the
inhibitor
is
capable
of
reversing
the
altered
host
immune
responses
induced
by
the
bacterial
phosphatase
and
restoring
the
macrophage's
full

Ghrelin
is
an
orexigenic
hormone
produced
by
the
stomach
in
direct
proportion
to
the
time
since
the
last
meal
and
has
therefore
been
called
a
'hunger
signal'
.

The
octanoylation
of
ghrelin
is
critical
for
its
orexigenic
functions
and
is
dependent
upon
ghrelin
O-acyltransferase
(
GOAT
)
catalyzation
.

The
GOAT
inhibitor
,
GO-CoA-Tat
,
decreases
the
circulating
concentrations
of
octanoylated
ghrelin
and
attenuates
weight
gain
on
a
high
fat
diet
in
mice
.

Unlike
rats
and
mice
,
Siberian
hamsters
and
humans
do
not
increase
food
intake
after
food
deprivation
,
but
increase
food
hoarding
after
food
deprivation
.

In
Siberian
hamsters
,
exogenous
ghrelin
increases
ingestive
behaviors
similarly
to
48-56h
food
deprivation
.

Therefore
,
we
tested
the
necessity
of
increased
ghrelin
in
food-deprived
Siberian
hamsters
to
stimulate
ingestive
behaviors
.

To
do
so
we
used
our
simulated
natural
housing
system
that
allows
hamsters
to
forage
for
and
hoard
food
.

Animals
were
given
an
injection
of
GO-CoA-Tat
(
i
.

p
.

,
11μmol
/
kg
)
every
6h
because
that
is
the
duration
of
its
effective
inhibition
of
octanoylated
ghrelin
concentrations
during
a
48h
food
deprivation
.

We
found
that
GO-CoA-Tat
attenuated
food
foraging
(
0-1h
)
,
food
intake
(
0-1
and
2-4h
)
,
and
food
hoarding
(
0-1h
and
2
and
3days
)
post-refeeding
compared
with
saline
treated
animals
.

This
suggests
that
increased
octanoylated
ghrelin
concentrations
play
a
role
in
the
food
deprivation-induced
increases
in
ingestive
behavior
.

Therefore
,
ghrelin
is
a
critical
aspect
of
the
multi-faceted
mechanisms
that
stimulate
ingestive
behaviors
,
and
might
be
a
critical
point
for
a
successful
clinical
intervention
scheme
in
humans

Meanwhile
,
the

,
nuclear
factor-kappa

were
significantly
down-regulated
at

by

.

Additionally
,
the
activity
of
superoxide
dismutase
(
SOD
)
was
elevated
,
while
the
content
of
malondialdehyde
(
MDA
)
was
lessened
in

.

As
revealed
by

,
PR
therapy
resulted
in
reduced
production
of

The

Neuroendocrine
tumors
are
very
heterogeneous
,
develop
from
a
variety
of
tissues

and
can
be
difficult
to
diagnose
.

Without
the
clinical
manifestation
of
metastases
,
it
is
often
difficult
to
characterize
them
as
malignant
.

Even
so-called
completely
(

)
resected
tumors
can
spread
clinically
visible
metastases
within
a
few
months
after

Treatment
options
for
neuroendocrine
tumors

pheochromocytoma
are
limited

Molecular
targeted
therapies
using
tyrosine
kinase
inhibitors
might
prove
to
be
helpful
in
patients
with
these
tumors
.

In
an
immunohistochemical
study
,
we
examined
KIT
in
26
pheochromocytomas
,
8
of
which
were
malignant
(
3
adrenal
pheochromocytomas
,
5
paragangliomas
)
.

KIT
expression
was
found
in
one
of
these
8
malignant
tumors

pheochromocytoma
originated
from
a
woman
with

and
spread
into

,
and
lung
.

KIT
expression
could
be
demonstrated
in
5%
of
tumor
cells
.

On
the
basis
of
KIT
expression
immunohistochemically
,
we
treated
patients
with

but
without
efficacy
after

months

.

Similar
results
were
shown
by

.

Therefore
,
monotherapy
with
imatinib
may
not
be
efficacious
in
patients
with
neuroendocrine
tumors
that
express
KIT
.

Tyrosine

HCF-1
is
a

was
employed
to

BACKGROUND
AND
OBJECTIVES
:
Activated
tyrosine
kinases
are
implicated
in
the
pathogenesis
of
chronic
and
acute
leukemia
,
and
represent
attractive
targets
for
therapy
.

Sorafenib
(
BAY43-9006
,
Nexavar
)
is
a
small
molecule
B-RAF
inhibitor
that
is
used
for
the
treatment
of
renal
cell
carcinoma
,
and
has
been
shown
to
have
activity
against
receptor
tyrosine
kinases
from
the
platelet-derived
growth
factor
receptor
(
PDGFR
)
and
vascular
endothelial
growth
factor
receptor
(
VEGFR
)
families
.

We
investigated
the
efficacy
of
sorafenib
at
inhibiting
mutants
of
the
receptor
tyrosine
kinases
PDGFRbeta
,
KIT
,
and
FLT3
,
which
are
implicated
in
the
pathogenesis
of
myeloid
malignancies
.

DESIGN
AND
METHODS
:
We
tested
the
effect
of
sorafenib
on
the
proliferation
of
hematopoietic
cells
transformed
by
ETV6-PDGFRbeta
,
FLT3
with
an
internal
tandem
duplication
or
D835Y
point
mutation
,
and
the
KIT
(
D816V
)
mutant
.

The
direct
effect
of
sorafenib
on
the
activity
of
these
kinases
and
their
downstream
signaling
was
tested
using
phospho-specific
antibodies
.

RESULTS
:
We
show
that
sorafenib
is
a
potent
inhibitor
of
ETV6-PDGFRbeta
and
FLT3
mutants
,
including
some
of
the
mutants
that
confer
resistance
to
PKC412
and
other
FLT3
inhibitors
.

Sorafenib
induced
a
cell
cycle
block
and
apoptosis
in
the
acute
myeloid
leukemia
cell
lines
MV4-11
and
MOLM-13
,
both
expressing
FLT3
with
an
internal
tandem
duplication
,
whereas
no
effect
was
observed
on
four
other
acute
myeloid
leukemia
cell
lines
.

The
imatinib-resistant
KIT
(
D816V
)
mutant
,
associated
with
systemic
mastocytosis
,
was
found
to
be
resistant
to
sorafenib
.

INTERPRETATION
AND
CONCLUSIONS
:
These
results
warrant
further
clinical
studies
of
sorafenib
for
the
treatment
of
myeloid
malignancies
expressing
activated
forms
of
PDGFRbeta
and
FLT3
.

In
determining
the
biological
profiles
of
various
antiprogestins
,
it
is
important
to
assess
the
hormonal
and
antihormonal
activity
,
selectivity
,
and
potency
of
their
proximal
metabolites
.

The
early
metabolism
of
mifepristone
is
characterized
by
rapid
demethylation
and
hydroxylation
.

Similar
initial
metabolic
pathways
have
been
proposed
for
CDB-2914
(
CDB
:
Contraceptive
Development
Branch
of
NICHD
)
and
CDB-4124
,
and
their
putative
metabolites
have
been
synthesized
.

We
have
examined
the
functional
activities
and
potencies
,
in
various
cell-based
assays
,
and
relative
binding
affinities
(
RBAs
)
for
progesterone
receptors
(
PR
)
and
glucocorticoid
receptors
(
GR
)
of
the
putative
mono-
and
didemethylated
metabolites
of
CDB-2914
,
CDB-4124
,
and
mifepristone
and
of
the
17alpha-hydroxy
and
aromatic
A-ring
derivatives
of
CDB-2914
and
CDB-4124
.

The
binding
affinities
of
the
monodemethylated
metabolites
for
rabbit
uterine
PR
and
human
PR-A
and
PR-B
were
similar
to
those
of
the
parent
compounds
.

Monodemethylated
mifepristone
bound
to
rabbit
thymic
GR
with
higher
affinity
than
monodemethylated
CDB-2914
or
CDB-4124
.

T47D-CO
cells
were
used
to
assess
inhibition
of
R5020-stimulated
endogenous
alkaline
phosphatase
activity
and
transactivation
of
the
PRE
(
2
)
-thymidine
kinase
(
tk
)
-luciferase
(
LUC
)
reporter
plasmid
in
transient
transfections
.

The
antiprogestational
potency
was
as
follows
:
mifepristone
/
CDB-2914
/
CDB-4124
/
monodemethylated
metabolites
(
IC
(
50
)
's
approximately
10
(
-9
)
M
)
>
aromatic
A-ring
derivatives
(
IC
(
50
)
's
approximately
10
(
-8
)
M
)
>
didemethylated
/
17alpha-hydroxy
derivatives
(
IC
(
50
)
's
approximately
10
(
-7
)
M
)
.

Antiglucocorticoid
activity
was
determined
by
inhibition
of
dexamethasone-stimulated
transcriptional
activity
in
HepG2
cells
.

The
mono-
and
didemethylated
metabolites
of
CDB-2914
and
CDB-4124
had
less
antiglucocorticoid
activity
(
IC
(
50
)
's
approximately
10
(
-6
)
M
)
than
monodemethylated
mifepristone
(
IC
(
50
)
approximately
10
(
-8
)
M
)
or
the
other
test
compounds
.

At
10
(
-6
)
M
in
transcription
assays
,
none
of
these
compounds
showed
progestin
agonist
activity
,
whereas
mifepristone
and
its
monodemethylated
metabolite
manifested
slight
glucocorticoid
agonist
activity
.

The
reduced
antiglucocorticoid
activity
of
monodemethylated
CDB-2914
and
CDB-4124
was
confirmed
in
vivo
by
the
thymus
involution
assay
in
adrenalectomized
male
rats
.

The
aromatic
A-ring
derivatives-stimulated
transcription
of
an
estrogen-responsive
reporter
plasmid
in
MCF-7
and
T47D-CO
human
breast
cancer
cells
but
were
much
less
potent
than
estradiol
.

Taken
together
,
these
data
suggest
that
the
proximal
metabolites
of
mifepristone
,
CDB-2914
,
and
CDB-4124
contribute
significantly
to
the
antiprogestational
activity
of
the
parent
compounds
in
vivo
.

Furthermore
,
the
reduced
antiglucocorticoid
activity
of
CDB-2914
and
CDB-4124
compared
to
mifepristone
in
vivo
may
be
due
in
part
to
decreased
activity
of
their
putative
proximal
metabolites
.
The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
assess
the
metabolic
and
physiological
changes
in
rats
fed
a
diet
high
in
fat
,
fructose
,
and
salt
,
and
with
excess
iron
level
.

Mineral
status
was
also
estimated
.

Wistar
rats
were
assigned
to
groups
fed
either
a
standard
control
diet
(
C
)
or
a
diet
high
in
fat
,
fructose
,
and
salt
.

The
noncontrol
diets
contained
either
normal
(
M
)
or
high
level
(
MFe
)
of
iron
.

After
6
weeks
,
the
length
and
weight
of
the
rats
were
measured
,
and
the
animals
were
euthanized
.

The
kidneys
and
gonads
were
collected
,
and
blood
samples
were
taken
.

Serum
levels
of
insulin
,
nitric
oxide
,
and
iron
were
measured
.

The
iron
,
zinc
,
copper
,
and
calcium
concentrations
of
tissues
were
determined
.

It
was
found
that
the
M
diet
led
to
a
significant
increase
in
the
relative
kidney
mass
of
the
rats
compared
with
the
control
group
.

Among
the
rats
fed
the
M
diet
,
markedly
higher
serum
level
of
iron
and
lower
levels
of
zinc
and
copper
were
observed
in
tissues
,
while
significantly
higher
calcium
levels
were
found
in
the
gonads
.

The
MFe
diet
resulted
in
decreased
obesity
index
,
insulin
level
,
and
nitric
oxide
serum
concentration
in
the
rats
,
when
compared
with
both
the
M
and
C
diets
.

The
high
iron
level
in
the
modified
diet
increased
the
relative
mass
of
the
gonads
.

The
excess
iron
level
in
the
diet
disturbed
the
zinc
,
copper
,
and
calcium
status
of
tissues
.

The
decrease
in
insulin
and
nitric
oxide
in
rats
fed
the
diet
high
in
iron
,
fat
,
fructose
,
and
salt
was
associated
with
disorders
of
zinc
,
copper
,
and
calcium
status
,
as
well
as
with
an
increase
in
the
relative
mass
of
the
gonads
.
Age-related
osteoblast
dysfunction
is
the
main
cause
of
age-related
bone
loss
in
both
men
and
women
.

In
the
present
study
,
the
effect
of
sciadopitysin
,
a
type
of
biflavonoids
,
on
osteoblast
function
was
investigated
in
osteoblastic
MC3T3-E1
cells
.

Sciadopitysin
caused
a
significant
elevation
of
alkaline
phosphatase
activity
,
collagen
synthesis
,
osteocalcin
production
,
mineralization
,
and
glutathione
content
in
the
cells
(
P<0
.
05
)
.

Sciadopitysin
also
decreased
the
production
of
tumor
necrosis
factor-a
(
TNF-α
)
induced
by
antimycin
A
,
a
mitochondrial
electron
transport
inhibitor
.

We
investigated
the
protective
effects
of
sciadopitysin
on
antimycin
A-induced
toxicity
in
osteoblastic
MC3T3-E1
cells
.

Exposure
of
MC3T3-E1
cells
to
antimycin
A
caused
a
significant
reduction
in
osteoblast
dysfunction
.

However
,
pretreatment
with
sciadopitysin
prior
to
antimycin
A
exposure
significantly
reduced
antimycin
A-induced
cell
damage
by
preventing
mitochondrial
membrane
potential
dissipation
,
adenosine
triphosphate
(
ATP
)
loss
,
reactive
oxygen
species
(
ROS
)
release
,
and
nitrotyrosine
increase
,
suggesting
that
sciadopitysin
may
be
useful
for
protecting
mitochondria
against
a
burst
of
oxidative
stress
.

Moreover
,
sciadopitysin
increased
phosphorylation
of
cAMP-response
element-binding
protein
(
CREB
)
inhibited
by
antimycin
A
.

Our
results
demonstrate
that
sciadopitysin
may
reduce
or
prevent
osteoblasts
degeneration

Gonadotropin-releasing
hormone
receptor
gene
expression
during
pubertal
development
of
male
rats
.
In
this
study
,
antidepressants
with
selectivity
for
the
noradrenaline
transporter
(
reboxetine
and
desipramine
)
,
or
the
serotonin
transporter
(
fluoxetine
and
clomipramine
)
were
examined
in
terms
of
their
ability
to
promote
an
anti-inflammatory
cytokine
phenotype
in
human
blood
.

In
addition
,
we
examined
the
ability
of
trimipramine;
a
tricyclic
antidepressant
that
is
devoid
of
monoamine
reuptake
inhibitory
properties
on
cytokine
production
.

Lipopolysaccharide
(
LPS
)
was
used
to
stimulate
monocyte-derived
pro-inflammatory
(
IL-1beta
,
TNF-alpha
,
IL-12
)
and
anti-inflammatory
(
IL-10
)
cytokines
,
whilst
concanavalin
A
(
Con
A
)
was
used
to
stimulate
T-cell
(
Th
(
1
)
:
IFN-gamma
and
Th
(
2
/
3
)
:
IL-10
)
cytokines
.

All
of
the
antidepressants
suppressed
IFN-gamma
production
in
the
10-50
microM
concentration
range
,
irrespective
of
their
preference
for
serotonin
or
noradrenaline
transporters
.

This
suppression
of
IFN-gamma
production
was
paralleled
by
reduced
T-cell
proliferation
,
therefore
we
suggest
that
the
ability
of
antidepressants
to
suppress
IFN-gamma
production
may
be
related
to
their
anti-proliferative
properties
.

The
fact
that
trimipramine
also
suppressed
IFN-gamma
production
and
T-cell
proliferation
indicates
that
these
immunomodulatory
actions
of
antidepressants
are
most
likely
unrelated
to
inhibition
of
monoamine
reuptake
.

Interestingly
,
exposure
to
a
lower
concentration
(
1
microM
)
of
the
antidepressants
tended
to
increase
T-cell-derived
IL-10
production
,
with
significant
effects
elicited
by
the
noradrenaline
reuptake
inhibitors
reboxetine
and
desipramine
.

In
contrast
to
the
robust
actions
of
antidepressants
on
T-cell
derived
cytokine
production
,
they
failed
to
induce
any
consistent
change
in
LPS-induced
monocyte
cytokine
production
.

Overall
,
our
results
indicate
that
IFN-gamma
producing
T-cells
(
Th
(
1
)
cells
)
are
the
major
target
for
the
immunomodulatory
actions
of
antidepressants
,
and
provide
evidence
questioning
the
relationship
between
the
monoaminergic
reuptake
properties
of
antidepressants
and
their
immunomodulatory
effects
.

The
potential
clinical
significance
of
the
anti-inflammatory
actions
of
antidepressants
is
discussed
.
In
this
work
,
the
improved

(
cPE
)
/

CB
)
nanocomposites
by
their
shape

effect
(
SME
)
is
investigated
.

CB
nanoparticles
are
found
to
be
homogeneously
dispersed
in
the
PE
matrix
and
significantly
increase
the
strength
of
the
materials
.

Compared
with
the
breaking
of
linear
PE
(
lPE
)
at
the
melting
temperature
(
T
(
m
)
)
,
the
cPE
and
cPE
/
CB
nanocomposites
still
have
high
strength
above
T
(
m
)
due
to
the
formation
of
networks
.

The
cPE
and
cPE
/
CB
nanocomposites
show
both
high
strain
fixity
ratio
(
R
(
f
)
)
and
high
strain
recovery
ratio
(
R
(

)
.

Crystallization-induced
elongation
is
observed
for
all
the
prepared
shape
memory
polymer
(
SMP
)
materials
and
the
effect
becomes
less
remarkable
with
increasing
volume
fraction
of
CB
nanoparticles
(
v
(
CB
)
)
.

The
scratch
self-healing
tests
show
that
the
cross-linking
of
PE
matrix
,
the
addition
of
CB
nanoparticles
,
and
the
previous
stretching
in
the
direction
perpendicular
to
the
scratch
favor
the
closure
of

This

could
have
potential
applications
in

The
molecular
mechanisms
by
which
cellular
energy
status
regulates
global
protein
synthesis
in
mammary
epithelial
cells
have
not
been
characterized
.

The
objective
of
this
study
was
to
examine
the
effect
of
AMP-activated
protein
kinase
(
AMPK
)
activation
by
2-deoxyglucose
on
protein
synthesis
and
the
mammalian
target
of
rapamycin
complex
1
(
mTORC1
)
signaling
pathway
in
bovine
mammary
epithelial
cells
.

Phosphorylation
of
AMPK
at
Thr172
increased
by
1
.
4-fold
within
5
min
,
and
remained
elevated
throughout
a
30-min
time
course
,
in
response
to
2-deoxyglucose
.

Global
rates
of
protein
synthesis
declined
by
78%
of
control
values
.

The
decline
in
protein
synthesis
was
associated
with
repression
of
mTORC1
signaling
,
as
indicated
by
reduced
phosphorylation
of
ribosomal
protein
S6
kinase
1
and
eIF4E
binding
protein-1
(
4E-BP1
)
.

Phosphorylation
of
ER-stress
marker
eIF2α
was
also
increased
but
only
at
30
min
of
2-deoxyglucose
exposure
.

2-Deoxyglucose
increased
phosphorylation
of
tuberous
sclerosis

(
TSC2
)
on
AMPK
consensus
sites
but
did
not
change
the
amount
of
TSC1
bound
to

.

Activation
of
AMPK
did
not
result
in
changes
in
the
amount

The
inhibitory
effects
of
AMPK
activation
on

signaling
were
associated
with
a
marked
increase
in
Ser792
phosphorylation
on

Collectively
,
the
results
suggest
that
activation
of
AMPK
represses
global

Some

has
suggested
that
(

pindolol
can
be
effective
at
producing
a
shortened
time
to
onset
of
antidepressant
activity
when
co-administered
with
a
serotonin
specific
reuptake
inhibitor
(

This
effect
has
been
attributed
to
the
antagonist
effects
of
pindolol
at
the

In

we

We

Metabolic

cardiovascular
events
are
increased
in
hypogonadism
.

Serum
HDL
composition
is
a
better
cardiovascular
predictor
than
the
HDL
counts
.

However
,
there
is
no
information
about
the
HDL
subfractions
in
patients
with
hypogonadism
.

We
designed
a
prospective
study
to
investigate
the
HDL
subfractions
in
treatment
naïve
subjects
with
hypogonadism
and
the
effects
of
2
different
testosterone
replacement
regimens
on
the
HDL
subfractions
.

Seventy
young
male
patients
with
congenital
hypogonadotropic
hypogonadism
(
CHH
)
and
70
age
and
BMI-matched
healthy
males
were
enrolled
in
the
present
study
.

The
patients
were
assigned
to
receive
intramuscular
injections
of
testosterone
esters
250
mg
every
3
weeks
and
transdermal
testosterone
applications
50
mg
daily
.

Biochemical
investigations
including
HDL
subfractions
and
insulin
resistance
were
done
.

Patients
with
CHH
had
higher
levels
of
insulin
,
HOMA-IR
,
WC
,
triglyceride
,
and
diastolic
blood
pressure
.

Although
,
the
HDL
cholesterol
concentrations
were
similar
in
both
groups
,
hypogonadal
patients
had
lower
HDL2
and
higher
HDL3
levels
.

The
total
testosterone
levels
were
independent
determinants
of
the
HDL2
subfractions
.

During
the
follow-up
,
a
significant
increase
in
the
BMI
and
WC
values
and
a
significant
decrease
in
the
levels
of
total
cholesterol
,
HDL
cholesterol
,
and
HDL3
were
observed
.

No
difference
was
present
between
the
2
treatment
arms
.

These
results
show
that
patients
with
hypogonadism
have
unfavorable
HDL
compositions
in
addition
to
the
other
dysmetabolic
features
.

However
,
testosterone
replacement
for
about
six
months
neither
improves
the
metabolic
problems
nor
the
HDL
composition
.

Mechanistic
studies
are
warranted
to
better
understand
the
cardiovascular
effects
of
unfavorable
HDL
compositions

the

PURPOSE
:
Sigma

(
sigmaRs
)
are
nonopioid

nonphencyclidine
binding
sites
with
robust
neuroprotective
properties
.

Previously
,
the
authors
induced

cell
line
using
very
high
concentrations
(
1
mM
)
of
the
excitatory
amino
acids
glutamate
(
Glu
)
and
homocysteine
(
Hcy
)
and
demonstrated
that
the
sigmaR1
ligand
(
+
)
-pentazocine
(
(
+
)
-PTZ
)
could
protect
against
cell
death
.

The
purpose
of
the
present
study
was
to
establish
a
physiologically
relevant
paradigm
for
testing
the
neuroprotective
effect
of
(
+
)
-PTZ
in
retinal
ganglion
cells
(
RGCs
)
.

METHODS
:
Primary
ganglion
cells
(
GCs
)
were
isolated
by
immunopanning
from
retinas
of
1-day-old
mice
,
maintained
in
culture
for
3
days
,
and
exposed
to

microM
)
.

Cell
viability
was
measured
using
the
viability
and
apoptosis

fluorescein
in

assays
.

Expression
of
sigmaR1
was
assessed
by
immunocytochemistry
,
RT-PCR
,
and
Western

.

Morphologic
appearance
of
live
ganglion
cells
and
their
processes
was
examined
over

)
by
differential

(
DIC
)
microscopy
after
exposure
to
excitotoxins
in
the
presence
or
absence
of
(
+
)
-PTZ
.

RESULTS
:
Primary
GCs
showed
robust
sigmaR1
expression
.

The
cells
were
exquisitely
sensitive
to
Glu
or
Hcy
toxicity
(

.

Primary

)
-PTZ
followed
by
18-hour
cotreatment
with

Similar
results
were
obtained
with

.

sigmaR1
mRNA
and
protein
levels
did
not
change
in
the
presence
of
the
excitotoxins
.

DIC
examination
of
cells
exposed
to
excitotoxins
revealed
substantial
disruption
of
neuronal
processes;
cotreatment
with
(
+
)
-PTZ
revealed
marked
preservation
of
these
processes
.

The
stereoselective
effect
of
(
+
)
-PTZ
for
sigmaR1
was
established
in
experiments
in
which
(
-
)
-PTZ
,
the
levo-isomer
form
of
pentazocine
,
had
no
neuroprotective
effect
on
excitotoxin-induced
ganglion
cell
death
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
Primary
GCs
express
sigmaR1;
their
marked
sensitivity
to
Glu
and
Hcy
toxicity
mimics
the
sensitivity
observed
in
vivo
,
making
them
a
highly
relevant
model
for
testing
neuroprotection

In

The

was
not
significantly

which
was
prevented
by

.

Data
suggest
that
the
increased
expression
of
B1R
by

cells
is
mediated
by
oxidative
stress

by
causing
hyperhomocysteinemia
.

Although
the
mutations
related
to
homocysteine
metabolism
possibly
increase
the
risk
of
stroke
,
the
data
are
conflicting
and
there
are
very
few
reports
linking
these
defects
to
acute
stroke
in
children
.

We
aimed
to
study
the
role
of
these
mutations
in
Turkish
children
with
ischemic
stroke
.

Forty-six
patients
having
cerebral
infarct
were
clinically
diagnosed
,
and
the
infarction
verified
with
magnetic
resonance
imaging
of
the
brain
was
included
in
the
study
.

All
patients
were
below
the
age
of
18
(
10
months
to
18
years
)
.

Sixty-eight
controls
,
consecutively
selected
among
healthy
unrelated
subjects
from
the
same
geographic
area
of
Turkey
without
personal
and
family
history
of
thrombosis
,
stroke
or
Behest's
disease
,
were
included
.

Genotyping
for
the
common
mutations
was
carried
out
by
the
methods
described
previously
.

There
was
no
difference
between
the
pediatric
stroke
patients
and
controls
for
the
distribution
of
methylene
tetrahydrofolate
reductase
(
MTHFR
)

,
MTHFR
1298
A-C
,
methylene
tetrahydrofolate

(
MTHFD
)
1958
G-A
and
methionine
synthase
reductase
(
MTRR
)
66
A-G
alleles
.

There
was
no
risk
for
double
gene
alterations
(
MTHFR
677
C-T
vs
.

1298
A-C
)
after
individuals
with
FV
1691
A
mutation
is
excluded
.

Twelve
of
the
46
patients
were
found
to
carry
FV
1691
A
mutation
(
26
.
0%
)
,
one
being
homozygote
.

The
cerebral
infarct
risk
for
FV
1691
A
was
found
to
be
6
.
4
(
CI
95%

.
7-23
.
0
)
.

Eight
of
the
46
patients
were
found
to
carry
PT
20210
A
mutation
(
16
.
6%
)
.

Two
of
the
FV
1691
A
heterozygous
patients
carried
PT
20210
A
mutation
at
the
same
time
(
4
.
2%
)
.

As
a
conclusion
,
we
can
say
that
FV
1691
A
and
PT
20210
A
mutations
are
important
and
must
be
included
to
the
routine
analysis
of
pediatric
stroke
patients
.
Changes
in
coagulation
and
fibrinolysis
were
investigated
in
20
patients
with
oesophageal
varices
,
who
underwent
endoscopic
injection

(
EIS
)
with
5
per

ethanolamine

(

)
,
by
means

fibrinopeptide
A
(
FPA
)
and
fibrinopeptide
B
beta
15-42
(
B
beta
15-42
)
.

One
hour
after
the
completion
of
EIS
,
the
value
of
FPA
was
significantly
increased
to
38

a

(

)
and
it
gradually
returned
to
normal
range
by
48
h
after
EIS
.

A
very
similar
change
was
observed
in
the
value
of
B
beta
15-42
(
P
less
than
0
.
01
)
.

These
observations
indicated
that
EIS
provokes
transient
activation
of
coagulation
and
fibrinolysis
.

In
vitro
studies
,
however
,
revealed
that
EO
inhibits
fibrin
clot
formation
because
of
the
Ca2
+
-chelating
ability
of
its
constituent
ethanolamine
,
although
oleate
or
benzyl
alcohol
exhibited
procoagulant
activity
in
FPA
formation
in
vitro
.

Nevertheless
,
an
external
application
of
EO
or
oleate
over
decapsulized
kidney
of
rat
resulted
in
a
significant
accumulation
of
125I-labelled
fibrin
(
ogen
)
.

From
these
results
it
was
suggested
that
intravascular
injection
of
EO
,
which
exerts
an
inhibitory
effect
on
coagulation
in
vitro
,
activates
the
local
coagulation
system
.

The
activation
may
be
accelerated
by
an
acute
inflammatory
process
provoked
by
oleate
,
which
is
supported
by
such
clinical
manifestations
as
mild
fever
,
retrosternal
pain
leukocytosis
and
an
increase
in
plasma
fibrinogen
level
which
was
observed
in
all
during
the
period
.

Accordingly
,
a
variety
of
human
tumors
are
characterized
by
elevated
expression
levels
of
the
hexokinase
2
isoform
(
HK2
)
.

Although
different
molecular
mechanisms
,
including
genetic
and
epigenetic
mechanisms
,
have
been
suggested
to
account
for
the
altered
expression
of
HK2
in
tumors
,
the
potential
role
of
microRNAs
(
miRNAs
)
in
the
regulation
of
HK2
expression
has
not
been
evaluated
.

Here
,
we
report
that
miR-143
inhibits
HK2
expression
via
a
conserved
miR-143
recognition
motif
located
in
the
3'-untranslated
region
(
3'UTR
)
of
HK2
mRNA
.

We
demonstrate
that
miR143
inhibits
HK2
expression
both
in
primary
keratinocytes
and
in
head
and
neck
squamous
cell
carcinoma
(
HNSCC
)
-derived
cell
lines
.

Importantly
,
we
found
that
miR-143
inversely
correlates
with
HK2
expression
in
HNSCC-derived
cell
lines
and
in
primary
tumors
.

We
also
report
that
the
miRNA-dependent
regulation
of
hexokinase
expression
is
not
limited
to
HK2
as
miR-138
targets
HK1
via
a
specific
recognition
motif
located
in
its
3'UTR
.

All
these
data
unveil
a
new
miRNA-dependent
mechanism
of
regulation
of
hexokinase
expression
potentially
important
in
the
regulation
of
glucose
metabolism
of

ABSTRACT
TRUNCATED
AT
250
WORDS
)
OBJECTIVE
:
Mutations
in
the
cardiac
sodium
channel
gene
,
SCN5A
,
cause
congenital
long
QT
syndrome
(
LQT3
)
,
Brugada
syndrome
,
idiopathic
ventricular
fibrillation
,
and
conduction
disease
by
distinct
cellular
and
clinical
electrophysiological
phenotypes
.

METHODS
:
Postmortem
molecular
analysis
of
SCN5A
was
conducted
on
an
infant
who
presented
shortly
after
birth
with
self-terminating
torsades
de
pointes
.

The
infant
was
treated
with
lidocaine
,
propranolol
,
and
mexiletine
and
was
stable
for
16
months
manifesting
only
a
prolonged
QT
interval
.

The
infant
collapsed
suddenly
following
presumed
viral
gastroenteritis
,
was
found
in
2
:
1
AV
block
,
and
was
subsequently
declared
brain
dead
.

Genomic
DNA
was
subjected
to
SCN5A
mutational
analyses
and
DNA
sequencing
revealing
a
novel
,
spontaneous
germline
missense
mutation
,
M1766L
.

The
M1766L
mutation
was
engineered
into
the
hH1a
clone
by
site-directed
mutagenesis
,
transfected
into
embryonic
kidney
cells
(
HEK-293
)
,
and
studied
by
voltage
clamp
.

RESULTS
:
The
M1766L
mutation
caused
a
significant
decrease
in
the
sodium
channel
expression
.

Co-expression
with
beta1
subunit
,
incubation
at
low
temperature
,
and
most
effectively
incubation
with
mexiletine
partially
'rescued'
the
defective
expression
.

In
addition
to
this
pronounced
loss
of
function
,
M1766L
also
showed
a
10-fold
increase
in
the
persistent
late
sodium
current
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
These
findings
suggest
that
M1766L-SCN5A
channel
dysfunction
may
contribute
to
the
basis
of
lethal
arrhythmias
,
displays
an
overlapping
electrophysiological
phenotype
,
and
represents
the
first
sodium
channelopathy
rescued
by
drug
.

The
antinociceptive

along
with

of
parecoxib
,
a
novel
,
potent
selective
cyclooxygenase-2
inhibiting
prodrug
,
and
those
of
ketorolac
,
a
nonselective
cyclooxygenase
inhibitor
,
were
evaluated
in
various
animal
models
.

Parecoxib
(
up
to
20
mg
/
kg
,
i
.

v
.

)
had
no
effect
in
two
acute
pain
models
,
namely
,
the
acetic
acid-induced
writhing
(
visceral
pain
)
and
the
formalin
test
(
tonic
pain
)
.

However
,
ketorolac
(
up
to
10
mg
/
kg
,
i
.

v
.

)
showed
marked
antinociceptive
effects
in
these
models
.

In
the
models
of
carrageenan-provoked
inflammatory
hyperalgesia
and
inflammation
,
and
in
lipopolysaccharide-induced
pyrexia
,
parecoxib
significantly
reversed
all
the
behavioral
changes
and
it
was
found
to
be
more
potent
than
ketorolac
.

Further
,
ketorolac
(
10
mg
/
kg
,
i
.

v
.

)
produced
visible
gastric
lesions
with
prominent
petechiae
and
hemorrhagic
streaks
.

However
,
parecoxib
was
without
any
effect
on
gastric
mucosa
.

The
present
results
showed
that
the
cyclooxygenase-2
inhibitor
,
parecoxib
,
when
administered
parenterally
,
has
potent
antihyperalgesic
,
anti-inflammatory
,
antipyretic
effects
and
has
a
better
safety
profile
than
with
ketorolac
,
with
sparing
of
cyclooxygenase-1
in
the
stomach
in
these
animal
models
.
To
date
,
peroxisome
proliferator-activated
receptors
(
PPARs
)
are
becoming
the
new
therapeutic
targets
for
the
treatment
of
metabolic
diseases
,
such
as
Type
2
diabetes
,
obesity
,
and
cardiovascular
disease
.

In
this
study
,
a
cell-based
high-throughput
PPARs
(
PPARα
/
β
/
γ
)
model
was
developed
for
the
screening
of
PPARs
agonists
.

The
screening
conditions
were
evaluated
through
analyzing
the
expression
value
of
luciferase
.

Finally
,
24
h
of
drug
acting
time
,
5
times
of
the
dilution
factor
of
luciferase
zymolyte
,
and
about
2
×
10
(
4
)
cells
/
well
on
HeLa
cells
in
96-well
plates
were
used
,
respectively
.

Furthermore
,
the
quality
of
high-throughput
screening
(
HTS
)
in
stability
and
reliability
was
evaluated
by
the
Z'-factor
.

Additionally
,
different
extracts
of
Rhizoma
Coptis
and
berberine
were
tested
by
the
developed
method
.

The
results
suggested
that
both
the
EtOAc
extract
and
berberine
were
able
to
activate
PPARα
/
β
/
γ
,
and
Rhizoma
Coptis
contains
potential
natural
agonists
of
PPARs
besides
berberine
.

In
conclusion
,
the
developed
HTS
assay
is
a
simple
,
rapid
,
stable
,
and
specific
method
for
the
screening
of
PPARs
natural
agonists
.
Regulation

The
juvenile
visceral
steatosis
(
jvs
)
mouse
,
having
a
mutation
in
the
carnitine
transporter
gene
Octn2
,
is
a
model
of
primary
systemic
carnitine
deficiency
in
humans
(
SCD
,
OMIM
212140
)
.

Like
humans
with
SCD
,
homozygous
jvs
-
/
-
mice
have
hepatic
and
cardiac
steatoses
,
reduced
plasma
and
tissue
carnitines
,
and
increased
urinary
carnitine
clearance
.

Because
symptomatic
heterozygotes
have
been
reported
for
some
fatty
acid
oxidation
disorders
,
including
SCD
,
we
compared
the
jvs
heterozygotes
to
normal
control
mice
.

We
measured
the
free
and
esterified
carnitine
,
total
cholesterol
,
and
triglycerides
in
adult
liver
samples
,
myocardium
,
and
skeletal

.

Our
results
indicate
significant
differences
between
the
livers
of
nonfasting

There
is
also
a
negative
correlation
between
hepatic
free
carnitine
and
triglycerides
from
jvs
heterozygotes
(
p
<
0
.

)
.

Similar
results
were
obtained
with
myocardium
and
skeletal
muscle
.

We
conclude
that
free
and
total
carnitine
levels
are
significantly
lower
in
the
heterozygote
mouse
liver
and
heart
while
triglyceride
and
total
cholesterol
levels
are
significantly
higher
.

We
speculate
that
in
situations
of
lipolytic
stress
,
some
SCD
heterozygotes
might
develop
clinical
symptoms
of
carnitine
deficiency
.

show
that
all
contain

in
the

CpG
island
hypermethylation
occurs
in
most
cases
of
cancer
,
typically
resulting
in
the
transcriptional
silencing
of
critical
cancer
genes
.

Procainamide
has
been
shown
to
inhibit
DNA
methyltransferase
activity
and
reactivate
silenced
gene
expression
in
cancer
cells
by
reversing
CpG
island
hypermethylation
.

We
report
here
that
procainamide
specifically
inhibits
the
hemimethylase
activity
of
DNA
methyltransferase
1
(
DNMT1
)
,
the
mammalian
enzyme
thought
to
be
responsible
for
maintaining
DNA
methylation
patterns
during
replication
.

At
micromolar
concentrations
,
procainamide
was
found
to
be
a
partial
competitive
inhibitor
of
DNMT1
,
reducing
the
affinity
of
the
enzyme
for
its
two
substrates
,
hemimethylated
DNA
and
S-adenosyl-l-methionine
.

By
doing
so
,
procainamide
significantly
decreased
the
processivity
of
DNMT1
on
hemimethylated
DNA
.

Procainamide
was
not
a
potent
inhibitor
of
the
de
novo
methyltransferases
DNMT3a
and
DNMT3b2
.

As
further
evidence
of
the
specificity
of
procainamide
for
DNMT1
,
procainamide
failed
to
lower
genomic
5-methyl-2'-deoxycytidine
levels
in
HCT116
colorectal
cancer
cells
when
DNMT1
was
genetically
deleted
but
significantly
reduced
genomic
5-methyl-2'-deoxycytidine
content
in
parental
HCT116
cells
and
in
HCT116
cells
where
DNMT3b
was
genetically
deleted
.

Because
many
reports
have
strongly
linked
DNMT1
with
epigenetic
alterations
in
carcinogenesis
,
procainamide
may
be
a
useful
drug
in
the
prevention
of
cancer
.

:
To

METHODS
:
PDE5

the
rat
liver
tissue
using
the
FPLC
system
(

.

RESULTS
:
Icariin
and
papaverine
showed
dose-dependent
inhibitory
effects
on
PDE5
and
PDE4
activities
.

The

The
novel
antidepressant
mirtazapine
has
a
dual
mode
of
action
.

It
is
a
noradrenergic
and
specific
serotonergic
antidepressant
(
NaSSA
)
that
acts
by
antagonizing
the
adrenergic
alpha2-autoreceptors
and
alpha2-heteroreceptors
as
well
as
by
blocking
5-HT2
and
5-HT3
receptors
.

It
enhances
,
therefore
,
the
release
of
norepinephrine
and
5-HT1A-mediated
serotonergic
transmission
.

This
dual
mode
of
action
may
conceivably
be
responsible
for
mirtazapine's
rapid
onset
of
action
.

Mirtazapine
is
extensively
metabolized
in
the
liver
.

The
cytochrome
(
CYP
)
P450
isoenzymes
CYP1A2
,
CYP2D6
,
and
CYP3A4
are
mainly
responsible
for
its
metabolism
.

Using
once
daily
dosing
,
steady-state
concentrations
are
reached
after
4
days
in
adults
and
6
days
in
the
elderly
.

In
vitro
studies
suggest
that
mirtazapine
is
unlikely
to
cause
clinically
significant
drug-drug
interactions
.

Dry
mouth
,
sedation
,
and
increases
in
appetite
and
body
weight
are
the
most
common
adverse
effects
.

In
contrast
to
selective
serotonin
reuptake
inhibitors
(
SSRIs
)
,
mirtazapine
has
no
sexual
side
effects
.

The
antidepressant
efficacy
of
mirtazapine
was
established
in
several
placebo-controlled
trials
.

In
major
depression
,
its
efficacy
is
comparable
to
that
of
amitriptyline
,
clomipramine
,
doxepin
,
fluoxetine
,
paroxetine
,
citalopram
,
or
venlafaxine
.

Mirtazapine
also
appears
to
be
useful
in
patients
suffering
from
depression
comorbid
with
anxiety
symptoms
and
sleep
disturbance
.

It
seems
to
be
safe
and
effective
during
long-term
use
.

times
greater
than
those
previously
reported
in
horses
(
receiving
the
same

of
PBZ
)
.

In
the
horse
,
the
lower
concentrations
had
produced
marked
inhibition
of
eicosanoid
synthesis
and
suppressed
the
inflammatory
response
.

The
higher
concentrations
in

were
insufficient
to
inhibit

)
,

)
,
and

.

These
differences
from
the
horse
might
be
the
result
of
:
(
a
)
the
presence
in
equine
biological
fluids
of
higher
concentrations
than
in
calves
of
the
active
PBZ
metabolite

BOC

,
was

protein
(
BCRP
)
,
P-glycoprotein
(

)
,
or

.

It
was
a
moderate
inhibitor
of
organic
anion
transporting
polypeptide
(
OATP
)
1B1
and
1B3
,
with
an
IC
(
50
)
of

and
4
.
9

,
respectively
.

In
human
hepatocytes
,
BOC
inhibited
CYP3A-mediated
metabolism
of
midazolam
,
OATP1B-mediated
hepatic
uptake
of
pitavastatin
,
and
both
the
uptake
and
metabolism
of

.

The
inhibitory
potency
of
BOC
was
lower
than
known
inhibitors
of
CYP3A
(
ketoconazole
)
,
OATP1B
(
rifampin
)
,
or
both
(
telaprevir
)
.

BOC
was
a
substrate
for
Pgp
and
BCRP
but
not
for
OATP1B1
,
OATP1B3
,
OATP2B1
,
organic
cation
transporter
,
or
sodium
/
taurocholate
cotransporting
peptide
.

Overall
,
our
data
suggest
that
BOC
has
the
potential
to
cause
pharmacokinetic
interactions
via
inhibition
of
CYP3A
and
CYP3A
/
OATP1B
interplay
,
with
the
interaction
magnitude
lower
than
those
observed
with
known
potent

.

Conversely
,
pharmacokinetic
interactions
of
BOC
,
either
as
a
perpetrator
or
victim
,
via
other
major
P450s
and

tested
are
less
likely
to
be
of
clinical

The
results

are
generally
supportive
of
these
conclusions

DRD2
gene
and
the
therapeutic
response
in
schizophrenia
patients
as
a
result
of
the
role
of
variations
in
the
receptor
in
modulating
receptor
expression
.

In
this
study
,
we
evaluate
the
role
DRD2
plays
in
chlorpromazine-induced
EPS
in
schizophrenic
patients
.

METHODS
:
We
identified
seven
SNP
(
single
nucleotide
polymorphism
)
(
-141Cins>del
,
TaqIB
,
TaqID
,
Ser311Cys
,
rs6275
,
rs6277
and
TaqIA
)
in
the
DRD2
gene
in
146
schizophrenic
inpatients
(
59
with
EPS
and
87
without
EPS
according
to
the
Simpson-Angus
Scale
)
treated
with
chlorpromazine
after
8
weeks
.

The
alleles
of
all
loci
were
determined
by
PCR
(
polymerase
chain
reaction
)
.

RESULTS
:
Polymorphisms
TaqID
,
Ser311Cys
and
rs6277
were
not
polymorphic
in
the
population
recruited
in
the
present
study
.

No
statistical
significance
was
found
in
the
allele
distribution
of
-141Cins>del
,
TaqIB
,
rs6275
and
TaqIA
or
in
the
estimated
haplotypes
(
constituted
by
TaqIB
,
rs6275
and
TaqIA
)
in
linkage
disequilibrium
between
the
two
groups
.

CONCLUSION
:
Our
results
did
not
lend
strong
support
to
the
view
that
the
genetic
variation
of
the
DRD2
gene
plays
a
major
role
in
the
individually
variable
adverse
effect
induced
by
chlorpromazine
,
at
least
in
Chinese
patients
with
schizophrenia
.

Our
results
confirmed
a
previous
study
on
the
relationship
between
DRD2
and
EPS
in
Caucasians
.
The
soy-derived
phytoestrogen
genistein
has
received
attention
for
its
potential
to
improve
vascular
function
,
but
its
mechanism
remains
unclear
.

Here
,
we
report
that
genistein
at
physiologically
relevant
concentrations
(
0
.
1-10
μM
)
significantly
inhibited
thrombin-induced
increase
in
endothelial
monolayer
permeability
.

Genistein
also
reduced
the
formation
of
stress
fibers
by
thrombin
and
suppressed
thrombin-induced
phosphorylation
of
myosin
light
chain
(
MLC
)
on
Ser
(
19
)
/
Thr
(
18
)
in
endothelial
cells
(
ECs
)
.

Genistein
had
no
effect
on
resting
intracellular
[
Ca
(
2
+
)
]
or
thrombin-induced
increase
in
Ca
(
2
+
)
mobilization
.

Addition
of
the
inhibitors
of
endothelial
nitric
oxide
synthase
or
estrogen
receptor
did
not
alter
the
protective
effect
of
genistein
.

RhoA
is
a
small
GTPase
that
plays
an
important
role
in
actin-myosin
contraction
and
endothelial
barrier
dysfunction
.

RhoA
inhibitor
blocked
the
protective
effect
of
genistein
on
endothelial
permeability
and
also
ablated
thrombin-induced
MLC-phosphorylation
in
ECs
.

Inhibition
of
PKA
significantly
attenuated
the
effect
of
genistein
on
thrombin-induced
EC
permeability
,
MLC
phosphorylation
,
and
RhoA
membrane
translocation
in
ECs
.

Furthermore
,
thrombin
diminished
cAMP
production
in
ECs
,
which
were
prevented
by
treatment
with
genistein
.

These
findings
demonstrated
that
genistein
improves
thrombin-induced
endothelial
barrier
dysfunction
in
ECs
through
PKA-mediated
suppression
of
RhoA
signaling
.

Impaired
wound
healing
frequently
occurs
in
patients
with
diabetes
.

Interluekin-8
(
IL-8
)
production
by
keratinocyte
is
responsible
for
recruiting
neutrophils
during
healing
.

Intense
inflammation
is
associated
with
diabetic
wounds
while
reduction
of
neutrophil
infiltration
is
associated
with
enhanced
healing
.

We
hypothesized
that
increased
neutrophil
recruitment
by
keratinocytes
may
contribute
to
the
delayed
healing
of
diabetic
wound
.

Using
cultured
human
keratinocytes
and
diabetic
rat
model
,
the
current
study
showed
that
high-glucose
environment
enhanced
IL-8
production
via
epidermal
growth
factor
receptor
(
EGFR
)
-extracelluar
signal-regulated
kinase
(
ERK
)
pathway
in
a
reactive
oxygen
species
(
ROS
)
-dependent
manner
in
keratinocytes
.

In
addition
,
diabetic
rat
skin
showed
enhanced
EGFR
,
ERK
and
IL-8
expression
as
compared
to
control
rats
.

The
dermal
neutrophil
infiltration
of
the
wound
,
as
represented
by
expression
of
myeloperoxidase
level
,
was
also
significantly
higher
in
diabetic
rats
.

Treating
diabetic
rats
with
dapsone
,
an
agent
known
to
inhibit
neutrophil
function
,
was
associated
with
improved
healing
.

In
conclusion
,
IL-8
production
and
neutrophil
infiltration
are
increased
in
high-glucose
environment
due
to
elevated
ROS
level
and
contributed
to
impaired
wound
healing
in
diabetic
skin
.

Targeting
these
dysfunctions
may
present
novel
therapeutic
approaches

Selenium
(

)
has
anti-inflammatory
and
antioxidant
properties
and
is
necessary
for
the
development
and
normal
function
of
the
central
nervous
system
.

This
study
was
aimed
to
compare
the
in
vitro
effects
of
3-methyl-1-phenyl-2-
(
phenylseleno
)
oct-2-en-1-one
(
C21H2HOSe;
organoselenium

and
sodium

)
and
nonprotein
thiols
(
NP-SH
)
content
in
the
cerebral
cortex
slices
of
the
young
rats
.

A
decrease
in
ADA
activity
was
observed
when
the
slices
were
exposed
to
organoselenium
at
the
concentrations
of
1
,
10
and
30
µM
.

The
same
compound
showed
higher
scavenger
capacity
of
NO
than
the
inorganic
compound
.

Inorganic
Se
was
able
to
protect
against
sodium
nitroprusside-induced
oxidative
damage
and
increased
the
NP-SH
content
.

Both
the
compounds
displayed
distinctive
antioxidant
capacities
and
were
not
cytotoxic
for
the
cerebral
cortex
slices
in
the
conditions
tested
.

These
findings
are
likely
to
be
related
to
immunomodulatory
and
antioxidant
properties
of
this
compound
.

Flavin
adenine
dinucleotide
(
FAD
)
is
an
essential
coenzyme
for
glutathione
reductase
(
GR
)
which
catalyzes
the
reduction
of
oxidized
glutathione
to
regenerate
the
reduced
form
involved
in
protection
against
oxidative
stress
.

Riboflavin
kinase
(
RFK
)
also
known
as
flavokinase
is
involved
in
the
first
step
of
bioactivation
of
riboflavin
(
RF
)
to
form
flavin
mononucleotide
(
FMN
)
which
can
be
subsequently
converted
to
FAD
in
an
ATP-dependent
reaction
catalyzed
by
FAD
synthetase
(
FADS
)
.

We
investigated
the
involvement
of
RFK
in
cisplatin
resistance
using
human
prostate
cancer
PC3
cells
.

RFK
overexpression
renders
cells
resistant
not
only
to
cisplatin
but
also
to
hydrogen
peroxide
(
H2O2
)
and
diamide
.

Furthermore
,
knockdown
of
RFK
expression
induced
apoptosis
.

We
demonstrated
that
overexpression
of
RFK
increased
the
levels
of
FAD
,
FMN
and
total
glutathione
and
the
expression
of
GR
and
glutathione
S-transferase-pi
(
GSTpi
)
.

RFK
expression
is
up-regulated
in
cisplatin-resistant
P
/
CDP6
cells
in
addition
to
FAD
,
total
glutathione
level
,
GR
and
GSTpi
.

Knockdown
of
RFK
expression
also
sensitized
both
PC3
and
P
/
CDP6
cells
to
cisplatin
.

Moreover
,
cellular
levels
of
RFK
expression
correlate
well
with
Gleason
score
,
known
as
a
good
indicator
of
patient
prognosis
.

The
present
study
suggests
that
RFK
expression
is
involved
not
only
in
cellular
protection
from
oxidative
stress
but
also
in
malignant
progression
of
prostate
cancer

Recombinant
interleukin-2
(
IL-2
)
(
aldesleukin
,
Proleukin
,
Chiron
,
Emeryville
,
CA
)
is
approved
for
treatment
of
cancer
patients
and
under
investigation
in
HIV-infected
individuals
.

However
,
treatment
with
aldesleukin
is
associated
with
toxicity
,
which
may
be
due
to
its
elicitation
of
inflammatory
mediators
from
cells
that
express
the
intermediate-affinity
IL-2
receptor
.

BAY
50-4798
,
a
novel
IL-2
analog
,
is
a
selective
agonist
for
the
high-affinity
receptor
.

It
induces
the
proliferation
of
activated
T
cells
with
a
potency
similar
to
that
of
aldesleukin
but
has
reduced
activity
on
cells
expressing
the
intermediate-affinity
receptor
.

In
the
current
study
,
we
compared
cytokine
responses
elicited
in
peripheral
blood
mononuclear
cell
(
PBMC
)
cultures
stimulated
with
BAY
50-4798
or
aldesleukin
.

BAY
50-4798
induced
approximately
5-fold
lower
mean
levels
of
endogenous
IL-2
than
aldesleukin
,
and
at
least
50%
lower
levels
of
proinflammatory
cytokines
,
such
as
tumor
necrosis
fctor-alpha
(
TNF-alpha
)
,
IL-1beta
,
IL-6
,
and
interferon-gamma
(

)
.

Furthermore
,
statistically
significant
reductions
in
the
levels
of
IL-5
,
IL-8
,
IL-10
,
IL-13
,
and
granulocyte-macrophage
colony-stimulating
factor
(
GM-CSF
)
were
observed
in
response
to
BAY
50-4798
.

These
findings
increase
our
understanding
of
the
biologic
action
of
BAY
50-4798
and
suggest
a
mechanism
by
which
it
may
exhibit
better

Carvedilol

We
studied
the
involvement
of
sensory
neurons
in
skin
sensitization
to
allergens
using
a
mouse
model
in
which
the
T-helper
type
2
response
is
essential
.

Skin
sensitization
to
fluorescein
isothiocyanate
(
FITC
)
has
been
shown
to
be
enhanced
by
several
phthalate
esters
,
including
dibutyl
phthalate
(
DBP
)
.

For
different
types
of
phthalate
esters
,
we
found
a
correlation
between
the
ability
of
transient
receptor
potential
(
TRP
)
A1
activation
and
that
of
enhancing
skin
sensitization
.

A
TRPA1-specific
antagonist
,
HC-030031
,
was
shown
to
suppress
skin
sensitization
in
the
presence
of
DBP
.

However
,
since
phthalate
esters
also
activate
TRPV1
,
phthalate
esters
could
activate
other
types
of
TRP
channels
non-selectively
.

Furthermore
,
sensitization
to
FITC
is
also
enhanced
by
menthol
,
which
activates
TRPA1
and
TRPM8
.

Here
we
established
an
in
vitro
system
for
measuring
TRPM8
activation
.

The
selectivity
for
TRPM8
was
established
by
the
fact
that
two
TRPM8
agonists
(
menthol
and
icilin
)
induced
calcium
mobilization
,
whereas
agonists
of
TRPA1
and
TRPV1
did
not
.

We
demonstrated
that
phthalate
esters
do
not
activate
TRPM8
.

TRPA1-antagonist
HC-030031
did
not
inhibit
TRPM8
activation
induced
by
menthol
or
icilin
.

These
results
show
that
phthalate
esters
activate
TRPA1
and
TRPV1
with
selectivity
.

TRPM8
activation
is
not
likely
to
be
involved
in
the
sensitization
to
FITC
.
Lipoxin
A4
(
LXA4
)
has
been
described
as
an
anti-inflammatory
mediator
,
which
exerts
its
effects
through
the
formyl
peptide
receptor
FPR2
,
also
known
as
ALX
.

However
,
there
has
been
a
controversy
whether
or
not
cells
expressing
FPR2
/
ALX
,
such
as
neutrophils
,
respond
to
LXA4
.

We
,
therefore
,
systematically
examined
the
ability
of
the
human
and
murine
forms
of
the
receptor
to
respond
to
LXA4
.

We
show
that
both
receptor
orthologues
responded
to
the
FPR2
/
ALX
peptide
agonist
WKYMVM
when
expressed
heterologously
.

In
contrast
,
LXA4
from
different
sources
neither
increased
[
Ca
(
2
+
)
]
i
and
extracellular-signal-regulated
kinase
(
ERK
)
phosphorylation
,
nor
did
it
induce
a
decrease
in
cAMP
levels
or
a
translocation
of
β-arrestin
.

Also
,
several
LXA4
analogues
were
found
to
be
unable
to
signal
through
FPR2
/
ALX
.

We
conclude
that
FPR2
/
ALX
is
not
activated
by
LXA4
and
that
the
molecular
mechanism
by
which
LXA4
functions
still
needs
to
be
identified
.
Oncogenic
forms
of
the
small
GTPase
Ras
increase
the
resistance
of
cells
to
killing
by
ionizing
radiation
(
IR
)
.

Although
not
all
of
the
signaling
pathways
for
radioresistance
are
well
defined
,
it
is
now
clear
that
Ras-dependent
signaling
pathways
involved
in
radioresistance
include
those
mediated
by
phosphatidylinositol
3'-kinase
(
PI3-K
)
and
Raf
.

Nevertheless
,
PI3-K
and
Raf
together
are
not
sufficient
to
reconstitute
all
of
the
resistance
conferred
by
Ras
,
indicating
that
other
effectors
must
also
contribute
.

We
show
here
that
Ras-driven
autocrine
signaling
through
the
epidermal
growth
factor
receptor
(
EGFR
)
also
contributes
to
radioresistance
in
Ras-transformed
cells
.

Conditioned
media
(
CM
)
collected
from
RIE-1
rat
intestinal
epithelial
cells
expressing
oncogenic
Ras
increased
the
survival
of
irradiated
cells
.

Ras-CM
contains
elevated
levels
of
the
EGFR
ligand
transforming
growth
factor
alpha
(
TGF-alpha
)
.

Both
Ras-CM
and
TGF-alpha
stimulated
EGFR
phosphorylation
,
and
exogenous
TGF-alpha
mimicked
the
effects
of
Ras-CM
to
increase
radioresistance
.

Blocking
EGFR
signaling
with
the
EGFR
/
HER-2
kinase
inhibitor
(
KI
)
GW572016
decreased
the
postradiation
survival
of
irradiated
Ras-transformed
cells
and
normal
cells
but
had
no
effect
on
the
survival
of
unirradiated
cells
.

Ras-CM
and
TGF-alpha
also
increase
PI3-K
activity
downstream
of
the
EGFR
and
increase
postradiation
survival
,
both
of
which
are
abrogated
by
GW572016
.

Thus
,
Ras
utilizes
autocrine
signaling
through
EGFR
to
increase
radioresistance
,
and
the
EGFR
KI
GW572016
acts
as
a
radiosensitizer
.

The
observation
that
Ras-transformed
cells
can
be
sensitized
to
killing
by
ionizing
radiation
with
GW572016
demonstrates
that
EGFR
KIs
could
potentially
be
used
to
radiosensitize
tumors
in
which
radioresistance
is
dependent
on
Ras-driven
autocrine
signaling
through
EGFR
.
Lead

However
,
Pb

and
the

The
current

Pb
(

For
these
purposes
,
Wistar
albino

were

)
for
three
days
and
the
effects
on

were
determined
.

At
the
in

level
,
rat
cardiomyocyte

cell
lines
were
incubated
with
increasing
concentration
of
Pb
(

(

)
and
the

,
and

were
determined
at
the
mRNA
and
protein
levels
using
real-time
PCR
and
Western
blot
analysis
,
respectively
.

The
results
showed
that
Pb
(
2

)
significantly
induced
cardiotoxicity
and
heart
failure
as
evidenced
by
increase
cardiac
enzymes
,
lactate

kinase
and
changes
in
histopathology
in

.

In
addition
,
Pb
(

treatment
induced
β-MHC
and
BNP
whereas
inhibited
α-MHC

levels
in

in
a
dose-dependent
manner
.

In
contrast
,
at
the
in

level
,
Pb
(
2
+
)
treatment
induced
both
β-MHC
and
α-MHC
mRNA
levels
in
time-
and
dose-dependent
manner
.

Importantly
,
these
changes
were
accompanied
with
a
proportional
increase
in
the
expression
of
CYP1A1
mRNA
and
protein
expression
levels
,
suggesting
a
role
for
the
CYP1A1
in
cardiotoxicity

Vitamin
A
metabolite
retinoic
acid
(
RA
)
plays
a
major
role
in
the
aging
adult
brain
plasticity
.

Conversely
,
chronic
excess
of
glucocorticoids
(
GC
)
elicits
some
deleterious
effects
in
the
hippocampus
.

We
questioned
here
the
involvement
of
RA
and
GC
in
the
expression
of
target
proteins
in
hippocampal
neurons
.

We
investigated
proteins
involved
either
in
the
signaling
pathways
[
RA
receptor
β
(
RARβ
)
and
glucocorticoid
receptor
(
GR
)
]
or
in
neuron
differentiation
and
plasticity
[
tissue
transglutaminase
2
(
tTG
)
and
brain-derived
neurotrophic
factor
(
BDNF
)
]
in
a
hippocampal
cell
line
,
HT22
.

We
applied
RA
and
/
or
dexamethasone
(
Dex
)
as
activators
of
the
pathways
and
investigated
mRNA
and
protein
expression
of
their
receptors
and
of
tTG
and
BDNF
as
well
as
tTG
activity
and
BDNF
secretion
.

Our
results
confirm
the
involvement
of
RA-
and
GC-dependent
pathways
and
their
interaction
in
our
neuronal
cell
model
.

First
,
both
pathways
regulate
the
transcription
and
expression
of
own
and
reciprocal
receptors
:
RA
and
Dex
increased
RARβ
and
decreased
GR
expressions
.

Second
,
Dex
reduces
the
expression
of
tTG
when
associated
with
RA
despite
stimulating
its
expression
when
used
alone
.

Importantly
,
when
they
are
combined
,
RA
counteracts
the
deleterious
effect
of
glucocorticoids
on
BDNF
regulation
and
thus
may
improve
neuronal
plasticity
under
stress
conditions
.

In
conclusion
,
GC
and
RA
both
interact
through
regulations
of
the
two
receptors
,
RARβ
and
GR
.

Furthermore
,
they
both
act
,
synergistically
or
oppositely
,
on
other
target
proteins
critical
for
neuronal
plasticity
,
tTG
and
BDNF
.

This
study
was
designed
to
investigate
chemical
characterization
of
the
water-soluble
polysaccharides
extracted
from

(
KBTP
)
,
and
their
antioxidant
and
hepatoprotective
effects
against

oxidative
damage
in
mice
.

HPLC
analysis
revealed
that
KBTP
is
the
typical
acidic
heteropolysaccharides
and
consisted
of
nine
monosaccharides
.

Furthermore
,
KBTP
showed
highly
ferric-reducing
antioxidant
power
and
scavenging
effects
against

,

in

.

Administration
of
KBTP
(
200
,
400
and
800mg

)
in
mice
ahead
of
CCl4
injection
could
observably
antagonize
the
CCl4-induced
increases
in
serum
ALT
,

,
TG
and
TC
,
and
the
hepatic
MDA
and

levels
,
respectively
.

Mice
with
KBTP
pretreatment
displayed
a
better
profile
of
hepatosomatic
index
and
the
improved
GSH
and
SOD
activities
in
comparison
with
CCl4-intoxicated
mice
.

These
biochemical
results
were
further
supported
with

assessment
,
revealing
that
KBTP
has
an
observable
prevention
of

Modulation
at
the
level
of
the
nucleus
tractus
solitarii
(
NTS
)
appears
to
be
an
effective
way
of
controlling
cardiovascular
reflexes
.

Angiotensin
II
acting
on
angiotensin
AT1
receptors
at
the
central
nervous
system
appears
to
have
an
important
role
in
these
modulatory
processes
.

The
hypothalamic
defence
area
(
HDA
)
is
a
potential
source
of
descending
fibres
containing
angiotensin
II
that
innervate
the
NTS
.

We
investigated
the
effect
of
AT1
receptor
blockade
in
the
NTS
on
the
response
to
stimulation
of
HDA
in
anaesthetised
rats
treated
with
the
neuromuscular
blocking
agent
pancuronium
bromide
.

The
characteristic
increase
in
heart
rate
,
blood
pressure
and
phrenic
nerve
activity
evoked
by
electrical
stimulation
of
HDA
is
decreased
by
the
microinjection
of
the
AT1
receptor
antagonist
losartan
into
the
NTS
and
the
cardiovascular
response
to
carotid
body
chemical
stimulation
is
also
reduced
.

These
results
support
the
hypothesis
that
AT1
receptors
in
the
NTS
play
a
role
in
the
modulation
of
cardiovascular
reflexes
,
and
modify
the
influence
exerted
on
the
processing
of
these
reflexes
by
other
areas
of
the
central
nervous
system
.

This
is
in

to
the
results
of
binding

from

,
where
these
beta
1-antagonists
bind
in
a
biphasic
manner
with
about
30%
of
an
additional
low
affinity
site
,
presumably
corresponding
to
the
beta
2-adrenoceptor
.

The
beta
1-selective
antagonist
bisoprolol
revealed
two
binding
sites
at
the
heart
membranes
and
at
the
myocytes
as
well
with

Our

suggest
that
viable

may
contain
two
beta

binding
sites
exhibiting
different
affinities
for

The
data
indicate
that
ZD1694
was
slightly
more
effective
against
FaDu
than
against

Of
interest

the

superior
to

may
complicate
the
study
of

of

with
human

grown
in
the
mouse
.

To
test
this

,
we
preadministered
methoxypolyethyleneglycol-conjugated
thymidine

(
MPEG-TPase;

MPEG-TPase
significantly
increased

However
,
preadministration

did
not
potentiate

The

in

Rats
were
intraperitoneally
injected
with
D-GalN
(
400
mg
/
kg
)
and
LPS
(
40
mug
/

)
to
induce
acute

failure
.

The
treatment
groups
were
then
intraperitoneally
administered
pseudoephedrine
/
ephedrine
at
0
h
and
4
h
after
induction
and
the
activation
induced
by
treatment
with
pseudoephedrine
and
/
or
LPS
on
the
primary
Kupffer
cells
(
KCs
)
was
monitored
.

Compared
with
controls
induced
by
GalN
/
LPS
alone
,
pseudoephedrine
dramatically
reduced
the
infiltration
of
inflammatory
cells
and
bile
ductular
hyperplasia
and
hepatic
necrosis
observed
in
liver
sections
.

It
inhibited
both
hepatocellular
apoptosis
and
the
expression
of
monocyte
chemotactic
protein-1
.

It
lowered
the
production
of
tumour
necrosis
factor-alpha
(
TNF-alpha
)
in
the
beginning
of
acute

failure
induced
by
D-GalN

.

Correspondingly
,
levels
of
alanine
aminotransferase
(
ALT
)
,
total
bilirubin
(
TBIL
)
and
malondialdehyde
were
attenuated
.

Ephedrine
demonstrated
all
these
identical
protective
effects
as
well
.

In
addition
,
pseudoephedrine
significantly
suppressed
the
production
of
p-IkappaB-alpha
,
reducing
the
degradation
of
sequestered
nuclear
factor
kappa
B
(
NF-kappaB
)
in
the
cytoplasm
,
and
inhibited
the
translocation
of

to
the
nucleus
,
the
transcription
of
TNF-alpha
mRNA
and
the
production
of

.

These
results
suggest
that
pseudoephedrine
and
ephedrine
have
a
potent
anti-inflammatory
activity
against
D-GalN
/
LPS-induced
acute
liver
failure
in
rats
,
and
this
comprehensive

effect
may
result
from
the

Therefore
we
designed

Temperature

When

,
extraction
of
lycopene
was
limited
by
the

With
a
large
excess
of

,
diffusion
was
also
limited
,
as
only

be
extracted

juice
.

Diffusion
did
not
vary
significantly
with

doubled
when
temperature
rose
from

When
the

was
mixed

targeting
of
p110α
to
the
Golgi
apparatus
is
reduced
by
PAQR3
downregulation
and
increased
by
PAQR3
overexpression
.

Insulin-stimulated
PI3K
activity
and
phosphoinositide
(
3
,
4
,
5
)
-triphosphate
production
are
enhanced
by
Paqr3
deletion
and
reduced
by
PAQR3
overexpression
in
hepatocytes
.

Deletion
of
Paqr3
enhances
insulin-stimulated
phosphorylation
of
AKT
and
glycogen
synthase
kinase
3β
,
but
not
phosphorylation
of
IR
and
IR
substrate-1
(
IRS-1
)
,
in
hepatocytes
,
mouse
liver
,
and
skeletal
muscle
.

Insulin-stimulated
GLUT4
translocation
to
the
plasma
membrane
and
glucose
uptake
are
enhanced
by
Paqr3
ablation
.

Furthermore
,
PAQR3
interacts
with
the
domain
of
p110α
involved
in
its
binding
with
p85
,
the
regulatory
subunit
of
PI3K
.

Overexpression
of
PAQR3
dose-dependently
reduces
the
interaction
of
p85α
with
p110α
.

Thus
,
PAQR3
negatively
regulates
insulin
signaling
by
shunting
cytosolic
p110α
to
the
Golgi
apparatus
while
competing
with
p85
subunit
in
forming
a
PI3K
complex
with
p110α
.

Imatinib
is
a
selective
protein
tyrosine
kinase
inhibitor
currently
used
in
the
treatment
of
chronic
myeloid
leukaemia
(
CML
)
.

It
specifically
suppresses
the
growth
of
bcr-abl
expressing
CML
progenitor
cells
by
blocking
the
ATP-binding
site
of
the
kinase
domain
of
bcr-abl
.

Imatinib
also
inhibits
the
c-abl
,
platelet
derived
growth
factor
receptor
(
PDGFR
)
,
abl-related
gene
and
stem
cell
factor
receptor
,
c-kit
,
protein
tyrosine
kinases
.

It
is
through
inhibition
of
c-kit
that
imatinib
is
also
used
clinically
in
the
treatment
of
gastrointestinal
stromal
tumours
.

We
have
recently
demonstrated
that
imatinib
also
specifically
targets
the
macrophage
colony
stimulating
factor
receptor
,
c-fms
,
at
therapeutic
concentrations
.

Although
this
finding
has
important
implications
with
regard
to
potential
side
effects
in
patients
currently
receiving
imatinib
therapy
,
these
results
suggest
that
imatinib
may
also
be
useful
in
the
treatment
of
diseases
where
c-fms
is
implicated
.

This
includes
breast
and
ovarian
cancer
and
inflammatory
conditions
such
as
rheumatoid
arthritis
.

We
also
speculate
that
imatinib
may
be
used
in
diseases
where
bone
destruction
occurs
due
to
excessive
osteoclast
activity
,
such
as
in
the
haematologic

Although
the

have
inhibitory

against
both

,
some
of
the
compounds
are
found
to
be
selective
against

supported
by
inhibition
of

The
Thai
banded
tiger
wasp
(
Vespa
affinis
)
is
one
of
the
most
dangerous
vespid
species
in
Southeast
Asia
,
and
stinging
accidents
involving
this
species
still
cause
fatalities
.

In
the
present
study
,
four
forms
of
V
.

affinis
phospholipase
A
(
1
)
were
identified
through
a
proteomics
approach
.

Two
of
these
enzymes
were
purified
by
reverse-phase
chromatography
,
and
their
biochemical
properties
were
characterised
.

These
enzymes
,
designated
Ves
a
1s
,
are
not
glycoproteins
and
exist
as
33441
.
5
and
33474
.
4
Da
proteins
,
which
corresponded
with
the
34-kDa
band
observed
via
SDS-PAGE
.

The
thermal
stabilities
of
these
enzymes
were
stronger
than
snake
venom
.

Using
an
in
vivo
assay
,
no
difference
was
found
in
the
toxicities
of
the
different
isoforms
.

Furthermore
,
the
toxicity
of
these
enzymes
does
not
appear
to
be
correlated
with
their
PLA
(
1
)
activity
.

The
cDNAs
of
the
full-length
version
of
Ves
a
1s
revealed
that
the
Ves
a
1
gene
consists
of
a
1005-bp
ORF
,
which
encodes
334
amino
acid
residues
,
and
67-
and
227-bp
5'
and
3'
UTRs
,
respectively
.

The
two
isoforms
are
different
by
three
nucleotide
substitutions
,
resulting
in
the
replacement
of
two
amino
acids
.

Through
sequence
alignment
,
these
enzymes
were
classified
as
members
of
the
pancreatic
lipase
family
.

The
structural
modelling
of
Ves
a
1
used
the
rat
pancreatic
lipase-related
protein
2
(
1bu8A
)
as
a
template
because
it
has
PLA
(
1
)
activity
,
which
demonstrated
that
this
enzyme
belongs
to
the
α
/
β
hydrolase
fold
family
.

The
Ves
a
1
structure
,
which
is
composed
of
seven
α-helixes
and
eleven
β-strands
,
contains
the
β-strand
/
ɛSer
/
α-helix
structural
motif
,
which
contains
the
Gly-X-Ser-X-Gly
consensus
sequence
.

The
typical
surface
structures
that
play
important
roles
in
substrate
selectivity
(
the
lid
domain
and
the
β9
loop
)
were
shortened
in
the
Ves
a
1
structure
,
which
suggests
that
this
enzyme
may
only
exhibit
phospholipase
activity
.

Moreover
,
the
observed
insertion
of
proline
into
the
lid
domain
of
the
Ves
a
1
structure
is
rare
.

We
therefore
propose
that
this
proline
residue
might
be
involved
in
the
stability
and
activity

,
258

completed
a

protocol
with

,

)
,
or

.

The
two
active
treatments
lowered

levels
to
the

extent
.

The
decreases
in
glycated
hemoglobin
(
HbA1c
)
observed
with
the
two
higher
doses
of
MSDC-0160
were
not
different
from
those
associated
with
pioglitazone
.

By
contrast
,
fluid
retention
as
evidenced
by
reduction
in
hematocrit
,
red

cells
,
and
total
hemoglobin
was
50%
less
in
the
MSDC-0160-treated
groups
.

There
was
also
a
smaller
increase
in

HMW
)
adiponectin
with
MSDC-0160
than
with
pioglitazone

)
,
suggesting
that

produces
less

Thus
,

may
have

similar
to
those

without

INTRODUCTION
:
The
Bradford
Hill
criteria
are
a
widely
used
,
useful
tool
for
the
assessment
of
biomedical
causation
.

We
have
examined
their
application
to
pharmacovigilance
using
the
example
of
cisapride-induced
QTc
interval
prolongation
/
arrhythmia
.

METHODS
:
A
literature
search
was
conducted
using
MEDLINE
,
EMBASE
,
Reactions
Weekly
and
regulatory
websites
to
identify
evidence
for
the
association
between
cisapride
and
QTc
interval
prolongation
/
arrhythmia
that
had
been
published
in
the
English
language
.

Two
hundred
and
five
publications
were
identified
as
being
potentially
suitable
for
the
study
.

After
excluding
irrelevant
articles
,
studies
on
high-risk
populations
and
review
articles
,
70
publications
were
assessed
using
the
Bradford
Hill
criteria
.

These
included
24
case
reports
,
case
series
or
spontaneous
report
summaries;
eight
epidemiological
studies;
22
clinical
studies;
and
16
experimental
(
in
vivo
and
in
vitro
)
publications
.

RESULTS
:
The
most
compelling
evidence
for
an
association
between
cisapride
use
and
QTc
interval
prolongation
/
arrhythmia
came
from
case
/
spontaneous
reports
and
biological
plausibility
.

Considering
the
rare
incidence
of
serious
cardiac
events
,
these
criteria
formed
the
basis
for
the
strength
of
the
association
.

The
number
of
reports
from
different
populations
showed
consistency
.

Specificity
was
supported
by
clinical
and
cardiographic
characterisation
of
the
events
.

There
were
temporal
relationships
between
the
events
and
the
initiation
of
cisapride
treatment
,
increases
in
the
dosage
and
the
receipt
of
interacting
medications
.

The
relationships
between
the
adverse
events
and
the
latter
two
factors
exhibited
biological
gradients
.

Experimental
evidence
could
be
found
from
biological
models
,
as
well
as
reports
of
positive
dechallenge
and
/
or
rechallenge
found
in
individual
patients
.

Cisapride
was
found
to
bind
the
human
ether-a-go-go-related
gene
(
HERG
)
potassium
channel
,
which
provides
a
plausible
mechanism
for
QTc
interval
prolongation
/
arrhythmia
.

Other
QTc
interval-prolonging
/
arrhythmic
drugs
that
also
bind
to
HERG
provided
an
analogy
for
cisapride
causing
QTc
interval
prolongation
/
arrhythmia
via
this
mechanism
.

The
evidence
provided
by
clinical
studies
was
inconsistent
,
and
epidemiological
studies
failed
to
demonstrate
an
association
.

Nevertheless
,
this
did
not
prevent
the
assessment
of
causation
.

DISCUSSION
:
This
study
showed
how
different
types
of
evidence
found
in
pharmacovigilance
can
be
evaluated
using
the
Bradford
Hill
criteria
.

Further
work
is
required
to
examine
how
the
criteria
can
be
applied
to
different
types
of
adverse
events
and
how
they
may
be
applied
to
pharmacovigilance
.
Glutathione
S-transferases

GST
polymorphisms
are
associated
with
the
development
of
cardiovascular
disease
(
CVD
)
and
diabetes

(
DM
)
,
especially
in
current-smokers
.

Non-alcoholic
fatty
liver
disease
(
NAFLD
)
is
a
predictor
of
future
CVD
or
DM
,
because
oxidative
stress
contributes
to
their
pathogenesis
.

This
study
investigated
whether
the
combination
of
smoking
status
and
GST
genotypes
could
affect
the
risk
for
NAFLD
.

A
cross-sectional
analysis
was
conducted
among

were
determined
and
deemed
to
be

.

The
prevalence

was

Among
never-smokers
,
carriers
of
one
,
and
those
of
two
or
more
high-risk
GSTM1
,
GSTP1
or
GSTA1
genotypes
were
at
a
higher
risk
for
NAFLD
than
those
who
were
not
carriers

and

,
and
the

,

.

This
is
the
first
report
to
show
that
the
combination
of
current-smoking
and
harboring
high-risk
GSTM1
,
GSTP1
and
/
or

is
interactively

This

These
results
provide
strong
support
of
the
hypothesis
that
the
cellular
target
of
these
drugs
is
DNA
topoisomerase

,
and
that
these
drugs
kill
cells
by
converting

BACKGROUND
:
Agents
inhibiting
the
renin-angiotensin-aldosterone
(
RAAS
)
system
have
an
important
role
in
slowing
the
progression
of
chronic
kidney
disease
.

We
evaluated
the
hypothesis
that
the
addition
of
an
aldosterone
receptor
antagonist
to
an
angiotensin-converting
enzyme
(
ACE
)
inhibitor
and
angiotensin
II
type
1
(
AT-1
)
receptor
blocker
(
ARB
)
(
triple

)
may
provide
an
additional
benefit

with
an
ACE

Annexin
1
(
named
p35
,
lipocortin
I
or
calpactin
II
)
,
initially
described
as
a
glucocorticoid
induced
protein
,
belongs
to
a
new
characterized
family
of
intracellular
proteins
.

In
the
skin
,
the
role
of
annexins
has
still
not
been
elucidated
.

In
a
previous
study
,
we
reported
the
localization
of
annexin
1
in
both
freshly
isolated
human
epidermal
cells
and
in
cultured
keratinocytes
using
immunofluorescence
,
FACS
analysis
and
immunoblotting
techniques
.

The
protein
was
characterized
by
Western
blot
and
immunoprecipitation
as
a
35
kDa
protein
.

Results
from
in
vivo
studies
confirmed
the
presence
of
annexin
1
in
basal
and
suprabasal
layers
of
normal
human
skin
with
modified
reactivity
patterns
in
hyperproliferative
lesions
.

In
the
present
study
,
the
role
of
glucocorticoids
in
annexin
1
regulation
was
investigated
in
epidermal
cells
by
Western
blot
and
immunoprecipation
assays
.

In
contrast
to
other
studies
,
we
found
that
glucocorticoid
treatment
of
epidermal
cells
led
to
a
decrease
in
annexin
1
content
in
the
cytoplasm
and
the
membranes
of
cells
.

As
annexin
1
was
not
detected
in
the
nucleus
of
cells
,
we
conclude
that
there
was
a
down
regulation
of
annexin
1
after
glucocorticoid
treatments
rather
than
a
translocation
of
the
protein
to
the
nucleus
.

Despite
the
absence
of
the
signal
peptide
sequence
necessary
for
protein
secretion
,
annexin
1
was
released
in
the
keratinocyte
culture
medium
.

We
found
that
the
protein
was
secreted
only
in
low
Ca2
+
medium
(
0
.
15
mM
)
,
this
process
required
an
active
metabolism
.
Appropriate
expression
of
the
GnRH
receptor
(
GnRH-R
)
in
gonadotropes
is
critical
for
GnRH
signaling
and
hence
for
gonadotropin
secretion
and
sexual
development
.

In
the
present
work
,
we
have
studied
the
ontogeny
of
the
steady-state
GnRH-R
mRNA
levels
in
pituitaries
of
male
rats
from
Day
5
to
Day
55
,
when
sexual
maturity
is
attained
.

Developmental
changes
of
gonadotropin
subunit
(
alpha
,
FSHbeta
,
and
LHbeta
)
mRNA
levels
were
also
assessed
.

In
addition
,
the
role
of
the
endogenous
GnRH
on
the
maturational
changes
of
GnRH-R
and
gonadotropin
subunit
gene
expression
was
investigated
.

Messenger
RNA
levels
were
determined
by
Northern
blot
analysis
of
total
RNA
from
anterior
pituitaries
.

Amounts
of
the
most
abundant
(
5
.
0
kb
)
GnRH-R
mRNA
increased
slowly
from
Day
5
through
the
infantile
and
the
juvenile
periods
,
to
peak
at
Day
35
(
12-fold
increase
vs
.

Day
5
)
.

Thereafter
,
the
levels
of
the
GnRH-R
mRNA
decline
slightly
until
Day
55
(
33%
decrease
vs
.

Day
35
)
.

Parallel
changes
were
observed
on
the
4
.
5-kb
transcript
of
the
GnRH-R
gene
.

Alpha
subunit
mRNA
was
easily
detected
at
Day
5
,
and
its
levels
increased
progressively
through
the
infantile
period
(
2
.
5-fold
increase
)
and
peaked
at
Day
25
(
3
.
3-fold
increase
vs
.

Day
5
)
with
a
smooth
nonstatistically
significant
increment
until
Day
35;
then
it
decreased
by
41
.
5%
at
Day
55
.

FSHbeta
and
LHbeta
mRNA
levels
rose
slowly
until
Day
25
.

A
sharp
rise
occurred
thereafter
to
reach
maximum
levels
at
Day
35
(
5
.
8-fold
for
FSHbeta
and
3
.
8-fold
for
LHbeta
vs
.

Day
25
)
.

Thereafter
,
the
levels
of
both
mRNAs
fell
until
Day
55
(
44
.
1%
decrease
for
FSHbeta
and
37
.
1%
decrease
for
LHbeta
vs
.

Day
35
)
.

To
ascertain
whether
developmental
activation
of
the
GnRH-R
and
gonadotropin
subunit
gene
expression
is
GnRH
dependent
,
we
have
studied
the
effect
of
blocking
the
endogenous
GnRH
action
by
treating
developing
male
rats
with
the
specific
GnRH
antagonist
cetrorelix
(
1
.
5
mg
/
kg
body
weight
/
week
,
s
.

c
.

)
through
the
infantile
(
Days
5-20
)
and
the
juvenile
periods
(
Days
20-35
)
.

Cetrorelix
completely
blocked
the
rise
of
levels
of
the
two
most
abundant
species
,
5
.
0
kb
and
4
.
5
kb
,
of
the
GnRH-R
mRNA
,
during
both
the
infantile
and
the
juvenile
periods
.

Cetrorelix
also
abolished
the
developmental
rise
of
the
gonadotropin
beta
subunit
mRNAs
during
the
two
periods
of
the
study
.

In
contrast
,
the
alpha
subunit
gene
expression
was
not
altered
by
cetrorelix
treatment
during
any
of
the
two
periods
.

These
data
demonstrate
that
sexual
maturation
of
male
rats
is
accompanied
by
a
progressive
and
concerted
induction
of
GnRH-R
and
gonadotropin
subunit
gene
expression
.

Developmental
activation
of
GnRH-R
and
gonadotropin
beta
subunit
genes
is
GnRH
dependent
.

The
apparent
GnRH-independent
regulation
of
the
alpha-glycoprotein
subunit
mRNA
levels
may
be
due
to
the
contribution
of
thyrotropes
and
perhaps
to
the
presence
of
exclusive
regulatory
signals
for
this
gene
.
Sphingolipid
biosynthesis
commences
with
the
condensation
of
L-serine
and
palmitoyl-CoA

by

Potentiation
of

subtype
A
(
GABA

receptor

is
involved
in
the
mechanisms
of
anesthetic
action
.

The
present
study
examined
the
immobilizing
action
of
the
volatile
anesthetic
isoflurane
in
mice
with
double
knockout
(
DKO
)
of
phospholipase
C-related
inactive

(
PRIP
)
-1
and
-2
.

Both
of
these
proteins
play
important
roles
in
the
expression
of
GABA
(
A
)
receptors
containing
the
gamma2
subunit
on
the
neuronal
cell
surface
.

Immunohistochemistry
for
GABA
(
A
)
receptor
subunits
demonstrated
reduced
expression
of
gamma2
subunits
in
the
spinal
cord
of
the
DKO
mice
.

Immunohistochemistry
also
revealed
up-regulation
of
the
alpha1
and
beta3
subunits
even
though
there
were
no
apparent
differences
in
the
immunoreactivities
for
the
beta2
subunits
between
wild-type
and
DKO
mice
.

The
tail-clamp
method
was
used
to
evaluate
the
anesthetic
/
immobilizing
effect
of
isoflurane
and
the
minimum
alveolar
concentration
(
MAC
)
was
significantly
lower
in
DKO
mice
compared
with
wild-type

,
indicating
an
increased

These
immunohistochemical
and
pharmacological
findings
suggest
that
reduced
expression
of
the
GABA

gamma2
subunit
affects
the
composition
and
function
of

.

Each
subunit
contains
two
independently
folded
domains
connected
by
a
linking
peptide
.

By
using
the
stable
substrate
and
product
analogs
10-formyl
5
,
8-dideazafolate
and
5
,
8-dideazafolate
,
respectively
,
we
have
determined
that
the
tight
binding
folate
site
is
separate
from
the
catalytic
site
and
that
it
is
located
on
the
N-terminal
domain
of
the
protein
.

This
was
achieved
by
cross-linking
10-formyl
5
,
8-dideazafolate
to
the
dehydrogenase
through
the
carboxyl
group
of
the
substrate
analog
.

The
cross-linked
substrate
analog
was
converted
to
the
cross-linked
product
complex
by
adding
either
NADP
+
or
2-mercaptoethanol
,
proving
that
the
10-formyl
5
,
8-dideazafolate
was
bound
at
the
active
site
.

With
the
active
site
cross-linked
to
5

8-dideazafolate
and
not
available
for
binding
,

.

Separation
of
the

showed
that
the
tightly
bound
5

was
located
on
the
small

AIM
:
To

(

receptor
)
is
involved
in
N-methyl-D-aspartate
(

)
-induced
excitotoxic
injury
in
the
mouse
brain
.

METHODS
:
Brain
injury
was
induced
by
NMDA
microinjection
(
50-150
nmol
in
0
.

microL
)
into
the
cerebral
cortex
.

,

(
30
mg
/
kg
)
,
and
an
antioxidant
,
edaravone
(
9
mg
/
kg
)
were
observed
.

RESULTS
:
In
the
NMDA-injured
brain
,
the
CysLT1
receptor
mRNA
,
and
protein
expression
were
upregulated
,
and
the
receptor
was
mainly
localized
in
the
neurons
and
not
in
the
astrocytes
.

Pranlukast
,
ketamine
and
edaravone
decreased
NMDA-induced
injury;
pranlukast
(
0
.
1
mg
/
kg
)
and
ketamine
inhibited
the
upregulated
expression
of
the
CysLT1
receptor
.

CONCLUSION
:
CysLT1
receptor
expression
in
neurons
is
upregulated
after
NMDA
injection
,
and
NMDA-induced
responses
are
inhibited
by
CysLT1
receptor
antagonists
,
indicating
that
the
increased
CysLT1
receptor
is
involved
in
NMDA
excitotoxicity
.

On
day
15
,
animals
were
subdivided
into
Treatment
and
No

groups
.

Treatment
animals
received
an
i

p
.

injection
of
vehicle
or
SB-656104;
No
Treatment
animals
received
no
injection
.

Sixty
min
later
,
Treatment
animals
were
either
decapitated
with
no
further
stress
(
0
min
)
or
submitted
to
acute
restraint
(
10
,
30
,
60
or
120
min
)
;
hormone
serum
levels
were
measured
.

No
Treatment
animals
were
employed
for
the
rest
of
measurements
.

CRS
decreased
body
weight
gain
and
increased
adrenal
weight
.

In
CTRL
animals
,
acute
restraint
increased
ACTH
and
CORT
secretion
in
a
time
of
restraint-dependent
manner;
both
responses
were
inhibited
by
SB-656104
.

Exposure
to
CRS
abolished
ACTH
but
magnified
CORT
responses
to
restraint
as
compared
to
CTRL
conditions;
SB-656104
had
no
effect
on
ACTH
levels
but
significantly
inhibited
sensitized
CORT
responses
.

In
CTRL
animals
,
5-HT7-LI
was
detected
in
magnocellular
and
parvocellular
subdivisions
of
PVN
and
sparsely
in
adrenal
cortex
.

Exposure
to
CRS
decreased
5-HT7-LI
and
protein
in
the
PVN
,
but
increased
5-HT7-LI
in
the
adrenal
cortex
and
protein
in
whole
AG
.

Higher
5-HT
and
5-HIAA
levels
were
detected
in
PVN
and
AG
from
CRS
animals
but
5-HIAA
/
5-HT
ratio
increased
in
AG
only
.

Finally
,
whereas
5-HT-LI
was
sparsely
observed
in
the
adrenal
cortex
of
CTRL
animals
,
it
strongly
increased
in
the
adrenal
cortex
of
CRS
animals
.

No
TPH
protein
was
detected
in
AG
from
both
animal
groups
.

Results
suggest
that
CRS
promotes
endocrine
disruption
involving
decreased
ACTH
and
sensitized
CORT
responses
to
acute
restraint
.

This
phenomenon
may
be
associated
with
increased
function
and
expression
of
5-HT7
receptors
as
well
as
5-HT
turnover
in
AG

BACKGROUND
:
In
the
United
States
,
Puerto
Ricans
and
Mexicans
have
the
highest
and
lowest
asthma
prevalence
,
morbidity
,
and
mortality
,
respectively
.

Ethnic-specific
differences
in
the
response
to
drug
treatment
may
contribute
to
differences
in
disease
outcomes
.

Genetic
variants
at
the
beta
(
2
)
-adrenergic
receptor
(
beta
(
2
)
AR
)
may
modify
asthma
severity
and
albuterol
responsiveness
.

We
tested
the
association
of
beta
(
2
)
AR
genotypes
with
asthma
severity
and
bronchodilator
response
to
albuterol
in
Puerto
Ricans
and
Mexicans
with
asthma
.

METHODS
:
We
used
both
family-based
and
cross-sectional
tests
of
association
with
8
beta
(
2
)
AR
single
nucleotide
polymorphisms
in
684
Puerto
Rican
and
Mexican
families
.

Regression
analyses
were
used
to
determine
the
interaction
between
genotype
,
asthma
severity
,
and
bronchodilator
drug
responsiveness
.

RESULTS
:
Among
Puerto
Ricans
with
asthma
,
the
arginine
(
Arg
)
16
allele
was
associated
with
greater
bronchodilator
response
using
both
family-based
and
cross-sectional
tests
(
p
=
0
.
00001-0
.
01
)
.

We
found
a
strong
interaction
of
baseline
FEV
(
1
)
with
the
Arg16Glycine
(
Gly
)
polymorphism
in
predicting
bronchodilator
response
.

Among
Puerto
Ricans
with
asthma
with
baseline
FEV
(
1
)
<
80%
of
predicted
,
but
not
in
those
with
FEV
(
1
)
>
80%
,
there
was
a
very
strong
association
between
the
Arg16
genotype
and
greater
bronchodilator
responsiveness
.

No
association
was
observed
between
Arg16Gly
genotypes
and
drug
responsiveness
among
Mexicans
with
asthma
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
Ethnic-specific
pharmacogenetic
differences
exist
between
Arg16Gly
genotypes
,
asthma
severity
,
and
bronchodilator
response
in
Puerto
Ricans
and
Mexicans
with
asthma
.

These
findings
underscore
the
need
for
additional
research
on
racial
/
ethnic
differences
in
asthma
morbidity
and
drug
responsiveness
.
Bleeding
complications
and
delayed
healing
of
gastric
ulcer
associated
with
use
of
clopidogrel
is
a
common
clinical
concern;
however
,
the
underlying
mechanisms
remain
to
be
determined
.

This
study
aimed
to
clarify
whether
clopidogrel
could
cause
the
damage
of
the
human
gastric
epithelial
cells
and
to
further
elucidate
the
mechanisms
involved
.

After
human
gastric
epithelial
cell
line
GES-1
had
been
treated
with
clopidogrel
(
0
.
5-2
.
5
mM
)
,
the
cell
proliferation
was
examined
by
MTT
assay
,
apoptosis
was
measured
with
DAPI
staining
and
flow
cytometry
analysis
,
and
the
barrier
function
of
the
tight
junctions
(
TJ
)
was
evaluated
by
permeability
measurement
and
transmission
electron
microscopy
.

Moreover
,
expression
of
the
TJ
proteins
occludin
and
ZO-1
and
the
phosphorylation
of
the
mitogen-activated
protein
kinases
(
MAPK
)
p38
,
ERK
,
and
JNK
were
examined
by
western
blot
.

In
addition
,
three
MAPK
inhibitors
specific
to
p38
,
ERK
and
JNK
were
used
,
respectively
,
to
verify
the
signaling
pathways
responsible
for
regulating
the
expression
of
the
TJ
proteins
being
tested
.

Results
showed
that
clopidogrel
significantly
increased
dextran
permeability
,
induced
apoptosis
,
suppressed
GES-1
cell
viability
,
and
reduced
the
expression
of
the
TJ
proteins
(
occludin
and
ZO-1
)
,
acting
through
p38
MAPK
phosphorylation
.

Furthermore
,
these
observed
effects
were
partially
abolished
by
SB-203580
(
a
p38
MAPK
inhibitor
)
,
rather
than
by
either
U-0126
(
an
ERK
inhibitor
)
or
SP-600125
(
a
JNK
inhibitor
)
,
suggesting
that
clopidogrel-induced
disruption
in
the
gastric
epithelial
cells
is
mediated
by
the
p38
MAPK
pathway
.

It
is
concluded
that
attenuated
expression
of
the
TJ
proteins
occludin
and
ZO-1
in
human
gastric
epithelial
cells
could
be
involved
in
clopidogrel-induced
gastric
mucosal
injury
through
activation
of
the
p38
MAPK
pathway
.

Several
signaling
pathways
are
believed
to
be
involved
in
the
epileptogenic
process
that
triggers
the
subsequent
changes
in
the
brain
causing
epilepsy
.

The
mammalian
target
of
rapamycin
(
mTOR
)
is
a
serine
/
threonine
kinase
that
in
the
brain
,
regulates
several
important
physiological
functions
such
as
neuronal
development
and
synaptic
plasticity
,
and
also
seems
to
be
involved
in
many
pathologies
,
including
epilepsy
and
psychiatric
disorders
.

Previous
work
in
animal
models
of
both
genetic
and
acquired
generalized
convulsive
epilepsies
,
has
suggested
that
modulators
of
the
mTOR
signaling
pathway
may
have
beneficial
neuroprotective
and
antiepileptogenic
effects
.

Here
,
we
investigated
for
the
first
time
,
the
effect
of
some
treatment
schedules
(
i
.

e
.

early
chronic
,
sub-chronic
and
acute
)
with
the
specific
mTOR
inhibitor
rapamycin
,
on
the
development
of
absence
seizures
and
seizure
parameters
as
well
as
depressive-like
behavior
in
WAG
/
Rij
rats
,
a
genetic
model
of
absence
epilepsy
,
epileptogenesis
and
mild-depression
comorbidity
.

In
addition
,
we
studied
the
possible
interaction
between
rapamycin
treatment
and
the
effects
of
bacterial
lipopolysaccharide
(
LPS
)
endotoxin
administration
,
which
is
known
to
aggravate
absence
seizures
through
generation
of
increased
neuroinflammatory
responses
.

We
found
that
rapamycin
(
early
chronic
treatment
for
17
weeks
,
starting
at
P45
)
exhibited
clear
antiepileptogenic
properties
also
in
this
animal
epilepsy
model;
however
,
this
effect
was
accompanied
by
unexpected
prodepressant
effects
.

Both
acute
and
sub-chronic
(
7
day
)
treatments
also
had
anti-absence
properties
,
but
the
sub-chronic
treatment
produced
contrasting
antidepressant
properties
in
the
WAG
/
Rij
rats
that
were
not
seen
in
control
Wistar
rats
.

The
rapamycin
/
LPS
co-administration
studies
showed
that
rapamycin
blocked
or
prevented
the
LPS-dependent
increase
in
absence
seizures
,
suggesting
an
anti-inflammatory-like
protective
action
.

In
conclusion
,
we
have
demonstrated
a
novel
antiepileptogenic
effect
of
rapamycin
in
a
well-established
animal
model
of
absence
epilepsy
,
and
we
suggest
that
this
effect
may
be
mediated
by
the
inhibition
of
inflammatory
processes
that
are
developed
in
the
brain
of
these
specific
animals
during
epileptogenesis
and
during
seizures
.

Our
experiments
here
suggest
new
insights
into
this
intriguing
field
,
which
deserves
to
be
further
explored
.

Phosphodiesterase
type
5
(
PDE5
)
mediates
the
degradation
of
cGMP
in
a
variety
of
tissues
including
brain
.

Recent
studies
have
demonstrated
the
importance
of
the
nitric
oxide
/
cGMP
/
cAMP-responsive
element-binding
protein
(
CREB
)
pathway
to
the
process
of
learning
and
memory
.

Thus
,
PDE5
inhibitors
(
PDE5Is
)
are
thought
to
be
promising
new
therapeutic
agents
for
the
treatment
of
Alzheimer's
disease
(
AD
)
,
a
neurodegenerative
disorder
characterized
by
memory
loss
.

To
explore
this
possibility
,
a
series
of
quinoline
derivatives
were
synthesized
and
evaluated
.

We
found
that
compound
7a
selectively
inhibits
PDE5
with
an
IC
(
50
)
of
0
.
27
nM
and
readily
crosses
the
blood
brain
barrier
.

In
an
in

mouse
model
of
AD
,
compound

In

the

,
causes

any

The
purpose
of
this
study
was
the
assessment
of
kidney
neutral
endopeptidase
expression
and
responses
to
candoxatrilat
(
a
specific
inhibitor
of
this
enzyme
)
in
rats
with
CCl4-induced
cirrhosis
.

Two
groups
of
control
rats
(
n

)
were
injected
with

3
mg

candoxatrilat
.

Three
groups
of

with
ascites
(
n
=
10
)
received
vehicle
alone
or
3
or
10
mg

kg
candoxatrilat
.

In
cirrhotic
rats
,
Western

analysis
revealed
a
170%
increase
in
renal
neutral
endopeptidase
protein
content
(
P
<
0

)
,
mainly
in
the
proximal

and
both

also
reduced

Glutamate
receptors
of
the
N-methyl-D-asparate
(
NMDA-
)
subtype
are
tetrameric
allosteric
and
ligand-gated
calcium
channels
.

They
are
modulated
by
a
variety
of
endogenous
ligands
and
ions
and
play
a
pivotal
role
in
memory-related
signal
transduction
due
to
a
voltage-dependent
block
by
magnesium
,
which
makes
them
Hebbian
coincidence
detectors
.

On
the
structural
level
NMDA
receptors
have
an
enormous
flexibility
due
to
seven
genes
(
NR1
,
NR2A-D
and
NR3A-B
)
,
alternative
splicing
,
RNA-editing
and
extensive
posttranslational
modifications
,
like
phosphorylation
and
glycosylation
.

NMDA
receptors
are
thought
to
be
responsible
for
excitotoxicity
and
subsequent
downstream
events
like
neuroinflammation
and
apoptosis
and
thus
have
been
implicated
in
many
important
human
pathologies
,
ranging
from
amyotrophic
lateral
sclerosis
,
Alzheimer's
and
Parkinson'
disease
,
depression
,
epilepsy
,
trauma
and
stroke
to
schizophrenia
.

This
fundamental
significance
of
NMDA
receptor-related
excitotoxicity
is
discussed
in
the
context
of
the
developing
clinical
success
of
Memantine
,
but
moreover
set
into
relation
to
various
proteomic
and
genetic
markers
of
said
diseases
.

The
very
complex
localisational
and
functional
regulation
of
NMDA
receptors
appears
to
be
dependent
on
neuregulins
and
receptor
tyrosine
kinases
in
cholesterol-rich
membrane
domains
(
lipid
rafts
)
,
calcium-related
mitochondrial
feedback-loops
and
subsynaptic
structural
elements
like
PSD-95
(

of

kD
)
.

The
flexibility
and
multitude
of
interaction
partners
and
possibilities
of
these
highly
dynamic
molecular
systems
are
discussed
in

The

has
captured
tremendous
interest
during

past
a
few
years
because
of
(

its
increasingly

It
has
been
reported
recently
that
granulocyte-colony
stimulating
factor
(
G-CSF
)
is
degraded
upon
exposure
to
human
neutrophil
elastase
(
HNE
)
,
and
this
has
a
negative
effect
on
the
ability
of
the
cytokine
to
promote
the
in
vitro
proliferation
and
maturation
of
CD34
+
cells
.

This
has
important
implications
on
the
possible
in
vivo
role
of
elastase
in
providing
negative
feedback
to
granulopoiesis
by
the
direct
antagonism
of
G-CSF
.

The
cytokine
used
in
that
study
was
expressed
in
Escherichia
coli
[
and
was
nonglycosylated
(
NG
)
]
,
unlike
the
naturally
occurring
cytokine
,
which
is
an
O-linked
glycoprotein
.

As
a
Chinese
hamster
ovary-derived
(
glycosylated
)
cytokine
is
available
,
we
compared
the
susceptibility
of
NG
and
glycosylated
G-CSF
to
elastase
degradation
by
incubating
the
cytokines
with
HNE
and
assessing
its
impact
by
sodium
dodecyl
sulfate
gel
electrophoresis
and
bioassay
.

We
confirmed
the
ability
of
elastase
to
degrade
NG
G-CSF
in
a
time-
and
concentration-dependent
manner
and
found
this
was
associated
with
a
reduction
in
biological
activity
of
the
cytokine
.

Glycosylated
G-CSF
,
however
,
was
more
resistant
to
elastase
degradation
,
although
prolonged
exposure
did
lead
to
degradation
and
decreased
biological
activity
.

The
significance
of
sugar
residues
on
glycosylated
G-CSF
in
providing
protection
against
the
effects
of
elastase
was
investigated
using
enzymatically
deglycosylated
G-CSF
and
a
mutated
form
of
the
G-CSF
molecule
that
was
expressed
in
yeast
but
was
NG
.

level
,
OTA
(
within
a

)
did
not
induce
an
agonistic
response

effect
was
observed
in
all
of

highest
concentration
tested
(

.

However
,
while
there
was
no
significant
cytotoxic

observed
in
the

at
this
concentration
,
there
was
a
corresponding
change
in
cell
morphology
which
may
be
related
to
the
resulting
antagonistic
effect
.

At
the
hormone
production
level
,
H295R
cells
were
used
as
a
steroidogenesis
model
and
exposed
to
OTA
(
within
a
concentration
range
of
0
.
1-1000
ng
/
ml
)
.

Treatment
of
the
cells
with
1000
ng
/
ml
OTA
increased
the
production
of
estradiol
(
117±14
ng
/
ml
)
over
3
times
that
of
the
solvent
control
(
36±9
pg
/
ml
)
.

Western
blotting
confirmed
an
increase
in
aromatase
protein
.

Overall
the
results
indicate
that
OTA
does
not
appear
to
interact
with
steroid
receptors
but
has
the
potential
to
cause
endocrine
disruption
by
interfering
with
steroidogenesis
.

This
is
the
first
study
identifying
the
effect
OTA
may
have
on
production
of
the
steroid
hormone
estradiol
.
This
study
aims
to
assess
the
efficacy
and
safety
of
Rehmannia
glutinosa
acteosides
used
in
combination
with
the
angiotensin
receptor
blocker
irbesartan
to
treat
primary
chronic
glomerulonephritis
.

A
total
of
479
patients
diagnosed
with
primary
chronic
glomerulonephritis
were
recruited
from
outpatient
clinics
and
were
randomly
assigned
to
the
treatment
group
(
Rehmannia

acteosides
,
two
200-mg
capsules
,
bid;
and
irbesartan
,
one
150-mg
tablet
,
qd
)
or
the
control
group
(
irbesartan
,
one
150-mg
tablet
,
qd
)
.

The
primary
outcome
was
24-h
urinary
protein
.

Secondary
outcome
measures
included
blood
pressure
,
estimated
glomerular
filtration
rate
,
erythrocyturia
,
serum
alanine
aminotransferase
,
aspartate
transaminase
and
electrolytes
.

After
8
weeks
of
treatment
,
the
treatment
group
showed
a
mean
reduction
in
24-h
proteinuria
of
36
.
42%
compared
to
baseline
,
which
was
significantly
higher
than
the
mean
reduction
from
baseline
of
27
.
97%
in
the
control
group
(
P
=
0
.
0278
)
.

Adverse
drug
reactions
occurred
at
a
similarly
low
rate
in
the
treatment
group
(
0
.
4%
)
and
control
group
(
1
.
2%
,
P
=
0
.
3724
)
.

In
the
treatment
of
chronic
glomerulonephritis
,
the
combination
of
Rehmannia
glutinosa
acteosides
and
irbesartan
can
reduce
proteinuria
more
effectively
than
irbesartan
alone
.

Glycans
anchored
to
residue
N297
of
the
antibody
IgG
Fc
domain
are
critical
in
mediating
binding
toward
FcγRs
to
direct
both
adaptive
and
innate
immune
responses
.

However
,
using
a
full
length
bacterial
IgG
display
system
,
we
have
isolated
aglycosylated
Fc
domains
with
mutations
that
confer
up
to
a
160-fold
increase
in
the
affinity
toward
the
low
affinity
FcγRIIa-R131
allele
as
well
as
high
selectivity
against
binding
to
the
remarkably
homologous
human
inhibitory
receptor
,
FcγRIIb
.

The
mutant
Fc
domain
(
AglycoT-Fc1004
)
contained
a
total
of
5
amino
acid
substitutions
that
conferred
an
activating
to
inhibitory
ratio
of
25
(
A
/
I
ratio;
FcyRIIa-R131
:
FcγRIIb
)
.

Incorporation
of
this
engineered
Fc
into
trastuzumab
,
an
anti-Her2
antibody
,
resulted
in
a
75%
increase
in
tumor
cell
phagocytosis
by
macrophages
compared
to
that
of
the
parental
glycosylated
trastuzumab
with
both
medium
and
low
Her2-expressing
cancer
cells
.

A
mathematical
model
has
been
developed
to
help
explain
how
receptor
affinity
and
the
A
/
I
ratio
relate
to
improved
antibody
dependent
cell-mediated
phagocytosis
.

Our
model
provides
guidelines
for
the
future
engineering
of
Fc
domains
with
enhanced
effector
function
.
It
is
has
been
hypothesized
that
methylselenol
is
a
critical
selenium
metabolite
for
anticancer
activity
in
vivo
.

In
this
study
,
we
used
a
protein
array
which
contained
112
different
antibodies
known
to
be
involved
in
the
p53
pathway
to
investigate
the
molecular
targets
of
methylselenol
in
human
HCT116
colon
cancer
cells
.

The
array
analysis
indicated
that
methylselenol
exposure
changed
the
expression
of
11
protein
targets
related
to
the
regulation
of
cell
cycle
and
apoptosis
.

Subsequently
,
we
confirmed
these
proteins
with
the
Western
blotting
approach
,
and
found
that
methylselenol
increased
the
expression
of
GADD
153
and
p21
but
reduced
the
level
of
c-Myc
,
E2F1
and
Phos
p38
MAP
kinase
.

Similar
to
our
previous
report
on
human
HCT116
colon
cancer
cells
,
methylselenol
also
inhibited
cell
growth
and
led
to
an
increase
in
G1
and
G2
fractions
with
a
concomitant
drop
in
S-phase
in
mouse
colon
cancer
MC26
cells
.

When
the
MC26
cells
were
transplanted
to
their
immune-competent
Balb
/
c
mice
,
methylselenol-treated
MC26
cells
had
significantly
less
tumor
growth
potential
than
that
of
untreated
MC26
cells
.

Taken
together
,
our
data
suggest
that
methylselenol
modulates
the
expression
of
key
genes
related
to
cell
cycle
and
apoptosis
and
inhibits
colon
cancer
cell
proliferation
and
tumor
growth
.
Cisapride
,
a
gastrointestinal
prokinetic
agent
,
is
known
to
cause
long
Q-T
syndrome
and
ventricular
arrhythmias
.

The
cellular
mechanism
is
not
known
.

The
human
ether-a-go-go-related
gene
(
HERG
)
,
which
encodes
the
rapidly
activating
delayed
rectifier
K
+
current
and
is
important
in
cardiac
repolarization
,
may
serve
as
a
target
for
the
action
of
cisapride
.

We
tested
the
hypothesis
that
cisapride
blocks
HERG
.

The
whole
cell
patch-clamp
recording
technique
was
used
to
study
HERG
channels
stably
expressed
heterologously
in
HEK293
cells
.

Under
voltage-clamp
conditions
,
cisapride
block
of
HERG
is
dose
dependent
with
a
half-maximal
inhibitory
concentration
of
6
.
5
nM
at
22
degrees
C
(
n
=
25
cells
)
.

Currents
rapidly
recovered
with
drug
washout
.

The
onset
of
block
by
cisapride
required
channel
activation
indicative
of
open
or
inactivated
state
blockage
.

Block
of
HERG
with
cisapride
after
channel
activation
was
voltage
dependent
.

At
-20
mV
,
10
nM
cisapride
reduced
HERG
tail-current
amplitude
by
5%
,
whereas
,
at
+
20
mV
,
the
tail-current
amplitude
was
reduced
by
45%
(
n
=
4
cells
)
.

At
-20
and
+
20
mV
,
100
nM
cisapride
reduced
tail-current
amplitude
by
66
and
90%
,
respectively
.

We
conclude
that
cisapride
is
a
potent
blocker
of
HERG
channels
expressed
in
HEK293
cells
.

This
effect
may
account
for
the
clinical
occurrence
of
Q-T
prolongation
and
ventricular
arrhythmias
observed
with
cisapride
.

BACKGROUND
AND
OBJECTIVES
:
Nucleoside
transporters
might
play
a
relevant
role
in
the
intracellular
targeting
of
many
nucleoside
analogs
used
in
anticancer
therapy
.

Two
gene
families
(
SLC28
and
SLC29
)
encode
the
two
types
of
human
nucleoside
transporters
,
concentrative
nucleoside
transporter
(
CNT
)
and
equilibrative
nucleoside
transporter
(
ENT
)
proteins
.

Chronic
lymphocytic
leukemia
(
CLL
)
cells
express
both
SLC28-
and
SLC29-related
mRNA
,
although
transport
function
seems
to
be
mostly
related
to
ENT-type
transporters
.

Here
we
have
analyzed
the
role
of
nucleoside
transporters
in
nucleoside-derived
drug
bioavailability
and
action
in
mantle
cell
lymphoma
(
MCL
)
cells
.

DESIGN
AND
METHODS
:
The
relative
amounts
of
hENT1
and
hENT2-related
mRNA
and
protein
were
analyzed
in
five
MCL
cell
lines
and
20
primary
MCL
tumors
by
real-time
quantitative
reverse
transcriptase
polymerase
chain
reaction
and
western
blots
.

Cell
viability
,
measured
by
annexin
V-FITC
staining
,
and
nucleoside-derived
drug
transport
were
also
studied
.

RESULTS
:
MCL
cells
express
higher
levels
of
hENT1
protein
than
do
CLL
cells
,
and
a
good
correlation
was
found
between
protein
and
mRNA
levels
of
hENT1
,
thus
indirectly
suggesting
that
hENT1
might
be
transcriptionally
regulated
in
MCL
cells
.

More
importantly
,
a
significant
correlation
between
these
two
parameters
,
drug
uptake
and
sensitivity
to
gemcitabine
,
was
also
observed
.

INTERPRETATION
AND
CONCLUSIONS
:
These
results
further
support
the
concept
that
nucleoside
transporters
are
implicated
in
the
therapeutic
response
to
nucleoside
analogs
,
and
suggest
a
particular
and
novel
role
for
hENT1
in
the
genotoxic
response
to
selected
nucleoside
analogs
,
such
as
gemcitabine
,
in
MCL
cells
.
Static
Laue

The
popularity
of
caffeine
as
a
psychoactive
drug
is
due
to
its
stimulant
properties
,
which
depend
on
its
ability
to
reduce
adenosine
transmission
in
the
brain
.

Adenosine
A
(
1
)
and
A
(
2A
)
receptors
are
expressed
in
the
basal
ganglia
,
a
group
of
structures
involved
in
various
aspects
of
motor
control
.

Caffeine
acts
as
an
antagonist
to
both
types
of
receptors
.

Increasing
evidence
indicates
that
the
psychomotor
stimulant
effect
of
caffeine
is
generated
by
affecting
a
particular
group
of
projection
neurons
located
in
the
striatum
,
the
main
receiving
area
of
the
basal
ganglia
.

These
cells
express
high
levels
of
adenosine
A
(
2A
)
receptors
,
which
are
involved
in
various
intracellular
processes
,
including
the
expression
of
immediate
early
genes
and
regulation
of
the
dopamine-
and
cyclic
AMP-regulated
32-kDa
phosphoprotein
DARPP-32
.

The
present
review
focuses
on
the
effects
of
caffeine
on
striatal
signal
transduction
and
on
their
involvement
in
caffeine-mediated
motor
stimulation

We
investigated
the
interactions
between
neutrophils

and
artificial
surfaces
,
and
whether
blocking
of
relevant
receptors
on
platelets
reduced
unwanted
activation
responses

Isolated
neutrophils
and
platelets
resuspended

plasma
were
recirculated
with
and
without
blocking
antibodies

,
or

molecule
C
(
JAM-C
)
in

using

.

Platelet
adhesion
to
the
tubing
was
inhibited
by
anti-CD42b
and
anti-CD62P
,
and
adhesion
of
neutrophils
by
anti-JAM-C
.

Formation
of
platelet-neutrophil
and
platelet
aggregates
was
reduced
by
anti-CD62P
.

Anti-JAM-C
decreased
platelet-neutrophil
aggregation
at
low
concentrations
and
platelet
macroaggregates
at
high
concentrations
.

Anti-CD62P
increased
neutrophil
CD11b
expression
but
not
degranulation
.

Anti-JAM-C
substantially
increased
neutrophil
degranulation
and
slightly
increased
CD11b
expression
.

Platelet
activation
increased
when
CD62P
was
blocked
and
decreased
with
anti-CD42b
antibody
.

High-dose
anti-JAM-C
reduced
platelet
activation
.

In
conclusion
,
inhibiting
platelet
and
neutrophil-platelet
interactions
had
useful
effects
but
no
single
blocking
antibody
seemed
capable
of
inducing
only
beneficial
effects

It
was
recently
suggested
that
the
non-neuronal
cholinergic
system
has
a
regulatory
role
in
pulmonary
inflammation
.

We
investigated
this
system's
involvement
in
the
control
of
cytokine
production
by
the
A549
human
alveolar
epithelial
cell
line
.

CXCL8
and
acetylcholine
(
ACh
)
concentrations
were
measured
using
ELISA
and
LC-MS
/
MS
,
respectively
.

The
mRNA
expression
of
muscarinic
receptor
(
MR
)
subtypes
was
determined
using
RT-PCR
.

In
A549
cells
,
TNF-α
increased
the
release
of
CXCL8
and
ACh
and
the
expression
of
the
subtype
3
MR
(
M3R
)
.

Furthermore
,
TNF-α-induced
CXCL8
secretion
was
(
i
)
inhibited
by
the
MR
antagonist
tiotropium
and
the
M3R
antagonist
4-DAMP
and
(
ii
)
enhanced
by
the
M1
/
M3R
agonist
pilocarpine
and
the
cholinesterase
inhibitor
physostigmine
.

Taken
as
a
whole
,
these
results
suggest
that
ACh
release
by
A549
cells
enhances
TNF-α-induced
CXCL8
secretion
through
activation
of
the
M3R
.

Western
blot
analysis
revealed
that
pilocarpine
and
physostigmine
enhanced
the
TNF-α-induced
phosphorylation
of
ERK1
/
2
and
p38
MAPK
and
the
degradation
of
IκBα
.

Inhibition
of
these
pathways
with
specific
inhibitors
abrogated
the
pilocarpine-induced
CXCL8
release
.

Our
results
suggest
that
the
TNF-α-induced
secretion
of
CXCL8
in
A549
cells
is
regulated
by
the
release
of
ACh
,
the
latter's
binding
to
the
M3R
and
the
downstream
activation
of
NF-κB
and
the
ERK1
/
2
and
p38
MAPK
signaling
pathways
.

Our
findings
suggest
that
MR
antagonists
may
have
anti-inflammatory
effects
by
preventing
pro-inflammatory
events

by
endogenous
,

,
was
purified
from

effectively
inhibited

In
addition
,
BGG-mediated
inhibition
of
AR
prevented
LPS-induced

with
BGG
decreased
the
number
of
inflammatory

that
infiltrate
the

The
objective
of
this
study
was
to
clarify
the
detoxification
pathways
of
selenomethionine
(
SeMet
)
in
mouse
liver
.

It
has
been
postulated
that
SeMet
may
be
metabolized
to
selenocysteine
(
SeCyH
)
via
a
pathway
similar
to
methionine
(
Met
)
.

CySeH
may
be
decomposed
to
H
(

)
Se
,
which
is
consequently
methylated
to
CH
(

)
SeH
,
(

(

and
(

.

In
this
study
,
we
estimated
that
the
median
lethal
single
oral
dose
(
LD
(
50
)
)
was
67

.

We
also
found
that
(
CH
(

)
)
(

)
Se
(

)
was
quickly
produced
in
mouse
liver
after
single
oral
administration
of
SeMet
.

This
result
suggested
the
existence
of
a
quick
alpha
,
gamma-elimination
pathway
.

We
measured
the
amounts
of
alpha-ketobutyrate
,
NH
(

)
,
and
CH
(
3
)
SeH
produced
by

L-propargylglycine
(
PPG
)
-treated
mice
in
order
to
verify
the
existence
of
alpha
,
gamma-elimination

.

PAD
is
an

.

)
,
which
is
necessary
for
conversion
of
SeMet
to
SeCyH
.

PPG
is
an
effective

(

)
relating
to
conversion
of
SeMet
to
SeCyH
.

When
SeMet
was
incubated
with
the
S9
fraction
from
liver
of
PAD-treated
mice
,
the
formation
of
alpha-ketobutyrate
was
much
the
same
as
that
from
nontreated
mouse
liver
.

However
,
the
amount
of
alpha-ketobutyrate
formed
significantly
decreased
in
the
reaction
of
SeMet
with
S9
fraction
from
the
liver
of
PPG-treated
mice
.

In
an
in
vivo
experiment
using
mice
treated
with
PAD
before
a
toxic
dosage
of
SeMet
,
the
amount
of
SeMet
in
the
liver
decreased
and
the
amount
of
acid-volatile
Se
derived
from
CH
(
3
)
SeH
increased
gradually
.

This
phenomenon
was
not
observed
in
the
PPG-pretreated
group
.

Furthermore
,
the
protein
fraction
that
had
the
alpha
,
gamma-elimination
enzyme
activity
was
found
in
mouse
liver
cytosol
by
gel
chromatographic
technique
.

The
results
of
this
study
indicated
that
SeMet
was
directly
metabolized
to
CH
(
3
)
SeH
by
an
alpha
,
gamma-elimination
enzyme
analogous
to

Adult-onset
citrullinemia
(
CTLN2
)
is
a
rare
hereditary
metabolic
disorder
characterized
by
highly
increased
concentration
of
citrulline
and
ammonia
in
the
plasma
,
which
is
ascribed
to
a
deficiency
of
argininosuccinate
synthetase
(
ASS
)
,
one
of
the
urea
cycle
enzymes
mainly
located
in
the
liver
.

Neurological
manifestation
in
CTLN2
patients
closely
resemble
those
of
hepatic
encephalopathy
and
in
the
past
,
most
patients
usually
followed
rapidly
deteriorating
clinical
courses
and
died
of
severe
brain
edema
within
a
few
years
after
onset
.

However
,
in
1995
the
first
CTLN2
patient
who
was
successfully
treated
by
living-related
liver
transplantation
was
reported
and
since
then
more
than
30
patients
had
underwent
this
operation
in
our
country
,
showing
good
outcomes
.

No
primary
defect
had
not
been
found
within
ASS
gene
locus
,
but
the
causative
gene
of
this
disorder
is
now
identified
as
the
"citrin
gene"
,
which
might
act
as
a
aspartate
/
glutamate
transporter
in
mitochondria
.

Different
phenotypes
are
seen
in
the
individuals
with
a
citrin
deficiency
:
neonatal
intrahepatic
cholestasis
,
juvenile-onset
chronic
pancreatitis
and
hepatocellular
carcinoma
without
cirrhosis
can
precede
the
appearance
of
CTLN2
.

The
precise
pathogenesis
of
this
disease
that
includes
the
relationship
between
the
mutations
of
citrin
gene
and
a
deficiency
of
hepatic
ASS
activity
remains
unclear

This
study
evaluated
the
effect
of
methylsulfonylmethane
(

on

injury
in
rats

A
single
injection
of

(

.

p
.

)
increased
serum
aminotransferases
(

)
activities
.

In
addition
,
CCl4
treatment
led
to
elevation
of
hepatic
malondialdehyde
(
MDA
)
content
as
well
as
decrease
in
superoxide
dismutase
(
SOD
)
and
catalase
(
CAT
)
activities
.

Furthermore
,
cytochrome
P450
2E1
(
CYP2E1
)
content
was
suppressed
while
proinflammatory
cytokines
tumour
necrosis
factor-α
(
TNF-α
)
and
interleukin-6
(
IL-6
)
levels
increased
in
liver
tissue
after
CCl4
administration
.

We
showed
that
acute
CCl4-induced
damage
was
accompanied
by
a
rise
in
Bax
/
Bcl2
ratio
indicating
apoptosis
.

Pre-treatment
with
MSM
(
400
mg
/
kg
)
inhibited
the
increases
of
serum
ALT
and
AST
activities
,
decreased
hepatic
MDA
,
TNF-α
,
IL-6
and
Bax
/
Bcl2
ratio
compared
to
CCl4
treated
group
.

On
the
other
hand
,
MSM
raised
SOD
and
CAT
activities
as
well
as
CYP2E1
level
in
liver
tissues
.

The
present
study
shows
that
MSM
possesses
a
hepatoprotective
effect
against
CCl4-induced
liver
injury
in
rats
.

This
protective
effect
might
be
through
its
antioxidant
,
anti-inflammatory
and
antiapoptotic
properties
.
Abstract
1
.

UDP-glucuronosyltransferases
(
UGTs
)
are
versatile
and
important
conjugation
enzymes
in
the
metabolism
of
drugs
and
other
xenobiotics
.

2
.

We
have
developed
a
convenient
quantitative
multi-well
plate
assay
to
measure
the
glucuronidation
rate
of
7-hydroxy-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin
(
HFC
)
for
several
UGTs
.

3
.

We
have
used
this
method
to
screen
11
recombinant
human
UGTs
for
HFC
glucuronidation
activity
and
studied
the
reaction
kinetics
with
the
most
active
enzymes
.

We
have
also
examined
the
HFC
glucuronidation
activity
of
liver
microsomes
from
human
,
pig
,
rabbit
and
rat
.

4
.

At
a
substrate
concentration
of
20
µM
,
the
most
active
HFC
glucuronidation
catalysts
were
UGT1A10
followed
by
UGT1A6
>UGT1A7
>UGT2A1
,
whereas
at
300
µM
UGT1A6
was
about
10
times
better
catalyst
than
the
other
recombinant
UGTs
.

The
activities
of
UGTs
1A3
,
1A8
,
1A9
,
2B4
and
2B7
were
low
,
whereas
UGT1A1
and
UGT2B17
exhibited
no
HFC
glucuronidation
activity
.

UGT1A6
exhibited
a
significantly
higher
Vmax
and
Km
values
toward
both
HFC
and
UDP-glucuronic
acid
than
the
other
UGTs
.

.

This
new
method
is
particularly
suitable
for
fast
activity

Dehydroepiandrosterone
(
DHEA
)
,
a
C19
human
adrenal
steroid
,
activates
peroxisome
proliferator-activated
receptor
alpha
(
PPARalpha
)
in
vivo
but
does
not
ligand-activate
PPARalpha
in
transient
transfection
experiments
.

We
demonstrate
that
DHEA
regulates
PPARalpha
action
by
altering
both
the
levels
and
phosphorylation
status
of
the
receptor
.

Human
hepatoma
cells
(
HepG2
)
were
transiently
transfected
with
the
expression
plasmid
encoding
PPARalpha
and
a
plasmid
containing
two
copies
of
fatty
acyl
coenzyme
oxidase
(
FACO
)
peroxisome-proliferator
activated
receptor
responsive
element
consensus
oligonucleotide
in
a
luciferase
reporter
gene
.

Nafenopin
treatment
increased
reporter
gene
activity
in
this
system
,
whereas
DHEA
treatment
did
not
.

Okadaic
acid
significantly
decreased
nafenopin-induced
reporter
activity
in
a
concentration-dependent
manner
.

Okadaic
acid
treatment
of
primary
rat
hepatocytes
decreased
both
DHEA-
and
nafenopin-induced
FACO
activity
in
primary
rat
hepatocytes
.

DHEA
induced
both
PPARalpha
mRNA
and
protein
levels
,
as
well
as
PP2A
message
in
primary
rat
hepatocytes
.

Western
blot
analysis
showed
that
the
serines
at
positions
12
and
21
were
rapidly
dephosphorylated
upon
treatment
with
DHEA
and
nafenopin
.

Results
using
specific
protein
phosphatase
inhibitors
suggested
that
protein
phosphatase
2A
(
PP2A
)
is
responsible
for
DHEA
action
,
and
protein
phosphatase
1
might
be
involved
in
nafenopin
induction
.

Mutation
of
serines
at
position
6
,
12
,
and
21
to
an
uncharged
alanine
residue
significantly
increased
transcriptional
activity
,
whereas
mutation
to
negative
charged
aspartate
residues
(
mimicking
receptor
phosphorylation
)
decreased
transcriptional
activity
.

DHEA
action
involves
induction
of
PPARalpha
mRNA
and
protein
levels
as
well
as
increased
PPARalpha
transcriptional
activity
through
decreasing
receptor
phosphorylation
at
serines
in
the
AF1
region
.
RATIONALE
:
Treatment
with
a
carbon
monoxide-releasing
molecule

,
CORM-2
)
or
a
classical
heme
oxygenase
1
inducer
(
cobalt
protoporphyrin

has
potent
anti-inflammatory
effects
,
but
the
role
played
by
these
treatments
in
the
antinociceptive
effects
of
morphine
during
acute
and
chronic
pain
was
not
evaluated
.

OBJECTIVES
:
In
wild
type
(
WT
)
,
neuronal
(
NOS1-KO
)
,
or
inducible
(
NOS2-KO
)
nitric
oxide
synthases
knockout
mice
,
we
evaluated
the
effects
of
CORM-2
and
CoPP
treatments
in
the
antinociceptive
actions
of
morphine
and
their
interaction
with
nitric
oxide
during
acute
,
visceral
,
and
chronic
inflammatory
or
neuropathic
pain
.

METHODS
:
Acute
and
visceral
pain
was
assessed
through
formalin
and
acid
acetic
writhing
tests
.

Chronic
inflammatory
pain
induced
by
the
intra-articular
administration
of
complete
Freund's
adjuvant
and
neuropathic
pain
by
partial
ligation
of
sciatic
nerve
were
evaluated
by
measuring
allodynia
and
hyperalgesia
using
the
von
Frey
filaments
,
plantar
,
or
cold
plate
tests
.

RESULTS
:
While
nitric
oxide
,
synthetized
by
NOS1
and
/
or
NOS2
,
increased
the
local
antinociceptive
effects
of
morphine
during
acute
and
chronic
pain
,
it
decreased
the
inhibitory
effects
of
morphine
after
visceral
pain
.

Moreover
,
while
CORM-2
or
CoPP
treatments
did
not
alter
or
reduced
the
antinociceptive
effects
of
morphine
during
acute
and
visceral
pain
,
both
treatments
improved
the
local
antiallodynic
and
antihyperalgesic
effects
of
morphine
after
chronic
inflammatory
or
neuropathic
pain
in
WT
,
but
not
in
KO
mice
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
CORM-2
and
CoPP
treatments
improved
the
local
antinociceptive
effects
of
morphine
during
chronic
inflammatory
and
neuropathic
pain
by
interaction
with
nitric

,
its

3
,
4-dihydroxyphenylacetic

(
DOPAC
)
and
homovanillic
acid
(
HVA
)
levels
in
the
striatum
as
well
as
hippocampus
of
freely
moving
rats
were
studied
.

Intracellular
DA
,
DOPA
,
DOPAC
and
HVA
levels
,
as
well
as
DOPA
accumulation
as
an
index
of
tyrosine
hydroxylase
activity
in
the
rat
brain
in
vivo
,
DA
re-uptake
in
the
striatum
and
hippocampus
,
and
monoamine
oxidase
(
MAO
)
activities
were
also
determined
.

Acute
administrations
of
therapeutic
ZNS
doses
(
20
and
50
mg
/
kg
)
increased
striatal
extracellular
DOPA
levels
,
intracellular
striatal
and
hippocampal
DOPA
levels
,
and
stimulated
DOPA
accumulation
in
both
brain
regions
.

ZNS
also
increased
striatal
and
hippocampal
intracellular
as
well
as
extracellular
DA
and
HVA
levels
,
but
decreased
those
of
DOPAC
levels
.

Chronic
(
3
weeks
)
administrations
of
therapeutic
ZNS
doses
(
20
and
50
mg
/
kg
/
day
)
increased
intracellular
DA
,
DOPA
,
DOPAC
and
HVA
levels
in
striatum
and
hippocampus
.

ZNS-induced
changes
were
greater
in
intracellular
levels
than
in
extracellular
levels
.

Acute
and
chronic
supratherapeutic
ZNS
dose
(
100
mg
/
kg
)
administration
decreased
intracellular
levels
of
all
substances
detectable
in
both
brain
regions
,
and
inhibited
DOPA
accumulation
.

Both
subtypes
of
MAO
(
type
A
and
type
B
)
activities
were
weakly
inhibited
by
ZNS
.

ZNS
showed
no
effect
on
DA
re-uptake
in
striatum
nor
in
hippocampus
.

These
results
suggest
that
therapeutic
ZNS
doses
increase
DOPA
accumulation
as
well
as
both
intracellular
and
extracellular
DA
,
DOPA
and
HVA
levels
.

Reabsorption
of
amino
acids
is
an
important
function
of
the
renal
proximal
tubule
.

pH-dependent
amino
acid
transport
has
been
measured
previously
using
rabbit
renal
brush-border
membrane
vesicles
(
BBMV
)
.

The
purpose
of
this
investigation
was
to
determine
whether
this
pH-dependent
uptake
represents
H
(
+
)
/
amino
acid
cotransport
via
a
PAT1-like
transport
system
.

The
rabbit
PAT1
cDNA
was
isolated
(
2296bp
including
both
5'
and
3'
untranslated
regions
and
poly
(
A
)
tail
)
and
the
open
reading
frame
codes
for
a
protein
of
475
amino
acids
(
92%
identity
to
human
PAT1
)
.

Rabbit
PAT1
mRNA
was
found
in
all
tissues
investigated
including
kidney
.

When
expressed
heterologously
in
a
mammalian
cell
line
,
rabbit
PAT1
mediates
pH-dependent
,
Na

uptake
of
proline
,
glycine
,
l-alanine
and
alpha-

methylamino

A
transport
system
with
identical
characteristics
(
ion
dependency
,
substrate
specificity
)
was
detected
in
rabbit
renal
BBMV
where
an
overshoot
was
observed
in
the
absence
of
Na
+
but
in
the
presence
of
an
inwardly
directed
H
+
gradient
.

In
the
presence
of
Na
+
and
under
conditions
in
which
PAT1
transport
function
was
suppressed
,
a
second
proline
uptake
system
was
detected
that
exhibited
functional
characteristics
similar
to
those
of
the
IMINO
system
.

The
functional
characteristics
of
rabbit
PAT1
in
either
mammalian
cells
or
renal
BBMV
suggest
that
PAT1
is
the
low-affinity
transporter
of
proline
,
glycine
and
hydroxyproline
believed
to
be
defective
in
patients
with
iminoglycinuria
.
Aim
:
FAAH
is
a
membrane
enzyme
that
terminates
the
activity
of
a
large
class
of
endogenous
signaling
lipids
.

Recent
studies
suggest
that
the
FAAH
Pro129Thr
polymorphism
is
a
common
mutation
in
the
FAAH
gene
that
is
significantly
associated
with
drug-addictive
traits
.

This
study
investigated
the
association
of
the
Pro129Thr
polymorphism
of
the
FAAH
gene
with
methamphetamine
dependence
,
methamphetamine-induced
psychosis
,
manic
episodes
and
panic
disorder
in
a
Malaysian
population
.

Materials
&
methods
:
This
polymorphism
was
genotyped
in
232
male
methamphetamine-dependent
subjects
and
in
241
male
controls
of
four
different
ethnicities
:
Malay
,
Chinese
,
Kadazan-Dusun
and
Bajau
.

Intergroup
statistical
analyses
were
performed
by
using
the
χ
(

)
-square
test
and
Fisher's
exact
test
,
where
necessary
.

In
cases
of
multiple
comparisons
,
the
Bonferroni
correction
was
performed
.

Results
:
Our
results
indicated
that
the
FAAH
Pro129Thr
polymorphism
showed
a
significant
association
with
risk
of
methamphetamine
dependence
in
the
pooled
subjects
(
odds

and

.

We
also
found
an
association
of
this
polymorphism
with
episodes
of
methamphetamine-induced
mania
in
the
Malay
group
(
OR
:
2
.

.

However
,
there
was
no
association
between
this
polymorphism
and
age
of
onset
of
drug
use
or
the
occurrence
of
methamphetamine-induced
psychosis
or
of

disorder
.

Conclusion
:
Our
findings
suggest
that
the
FAAH
Pro129Thr
polymorphism
may
contribute
to
methamphetamine
dependence
in
the
Malay
and
Chinese
ethnic
groups
.

The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
examine
whether
oral
supplementation
of
quercetin-rich
onion
peel
extract
(
OPE
)
influences
blood
coagulation
and
arterial
thrombosis
in
Sprague-Dawley
(
SD
)
rats
.

24
male
rats
,
5weeks
old
,
were
divided
into
three
groups
with
different
diets
(
C
:
control
,
2mg
OPE
:
chow
diet
with
2mg
OPE
supplementation
,
10mg
OPE
:
chow
diet
with
10mg
OPE
supplementation
)
for
6weeks
.

Blood
coagulation
parameters
including
prothrombin
time
(
PT
)
,
activated
partial
thromboplastin
time
(
aPTT
)
and
platelet
aggregation
were
examined
.

The
OPE
did
not
affect
blood
cholesterol
levels
but
significantly
decreased
blood
triglyceride
and
glucose
levels
.

PT
,
aPTT
and
platelet
aggregation
were
not
significantly
different
among
all
tested
groups
.

However
,
in
vivo
arterial
thrombosis
was
significantly
delayed
in
groups
that
were
fed
2mg
and
10mg
OPE
diets
compared
to
the
control
group
.

In
addition
,
the
OPE
greatly
diminished
thrombin-induced
expression
of
tissue
factor
in
human
umbilical
vein
endothelial
cells
(
HUVECs
)
,
a
coagulation
initiator
.

In
addition
,
extracellular
signal-regulated
kinase
(
ERK
)
and
c-Jun
N-terminal
kinase
(
JNK
)
signaling
pathways
activated
by
thrombin
treatment
were
prevented
by
the
OPE
pre-treatment
.

These
results
indicate
that
OPE
may
have
anti-thrombotic
effects
through
restricting
the
induced
expression
of
tissue
factor
via
down-regulating
mitogen-activated
protein
kinase
(
MAPK
)
activation
upon
coagulation
stimulus
,
leading
to
the
prolongation
of
time
for
arterial
thrombosis
.
Prostaglandin
E2
attenuates
airway
pathology
in
asthmatic
patients
and
exerts
a
protective
effect
in
antigen-sensitized
mice
when
administered
systemically
.

We
aimed
to
establish
the
consequences
of
intranasal
PGE2
administration
on
airway
reactivity
to
aeroallergens
in
mice
and
reveal
the
underlying
immunoinflammatory
mechanisms
.

PGE2
was
administered
either
daily
during
a
10-day
exposure
to
house
dust
mite
(
HDM
)
extracts
or
for
limited
intervals
.

Airway
hyperreactivity
was
measured
by
whole-body
and
invasive
plethysmography
.

The
phenotypes
of
lung
immune
cells
and
cytokine
production
were
analysed
by
flow
cytometry
and
ELISA
,
respectively
.

Airway
hyperreactivity
was
sustainably
reduced
only
when
PGE2
administration
was
restricted
to
the
initial
5
days
of
exposure
to
HDM
.

Lung
inflammation
,
IL-4
production
,
and
airway
mast
cell
activity
were
also
prevented
under
this
early
short-term
treatment
with
PGE2
.

Interestingly
,
a
Th2
response
was
already
committed
on
day
5
of
exposure
to
HDM
.

This
was
paralleled
by
GM-CSF
and
osteopontin
upregulation
and
a
decreased
number
of
plasmacytoid
dendritic
and
T
regulatory
cells
,
as
well
as
a
trend
towards
reduced
IL-10
expression
.

Local
PGE2
administration
prevented
the
increase
of
airway
IL-13
and
osteopontin
and
kept
lung
plasmacytoid
dendritic
cell
counts
close
to
baseline
.

GM-CSF
and
Tregs
were
unaffected
by
the
treatment
.

These
findings
suggest
that
the
protection
provided
by
PGE2
is
a
result
of
the
modulation
of
early
lung
immunomodulatory
mechanisms
,
and
possibly
a
shift
in
the
balance
of
dendritic
cells
towards
a
tolerogenic
profile
.
Humans
are
commonly
exposed
to
nicotine
,
one
of
the
most
important
lifestyle
chemicals
.

The
occurrence
of
high
levels
of
arsenic
in
the
groundwater
of
the
southeast
region
of
Asia
has
received
much
attention
in
the
past
decade
and
has
become
a
global
health
concern
.

Predominant
occurrence
of
both
these
chemicals
and
ease
of
their
human
exposure
led
us
to
investigate
the
effect
of
nicotine
,
a
major
tobacco
alkaloid
,
on
arsenic
toxicity
.

Adult
male
rats
were
pre-exposed
to
two
different
doses
of
nicotine
(
0
.
75
and
3
mg
/
kg
,
intraperitoneally
)
for
7
days
followed
by
30
days
of
arsenic
exposure
(
50
ppm
sodium
arsenite
in
drinking
water
)
.

Nicotine
pre-exposure
resulted
in
an
increased
brain
arsenic
accumulation
and
a
decreased
liver
arsenic
concentration
.

Arsenic
also
caused
a
significant
oxidative
stress
in
the
blood
,
brain
and
liver
of
the
exposed
rats
.

Glutathione-S-transferase
,
a
phase
II
enzyme
,
was
inhibited
by
both
arsenic
and
nicotine
but
no
such
inhibition
was
noted
in
arsenic-treated
animals
pre-exposed
to
nicotine
.

Upon
nicotine
pre-exposure
,
brain
acetylcholinesterase
increased
,
while
monoamine
oxidase
(
MAO
)
decreased
.

The
toxic
effects
of
MAO
significantly
attenuated
with
nicotine
pre-exposure
.

The
present
study
suggests
that
nicotine
may
not
be
the
major
contributing
factor
for
the
previously
reported
synergistic
toxic
interaction
between
tobacco
and
arsenic
.

Nicotine
pre-exposure
in
arsenic-exposed
animals
revealed
interesting
toxicokinetics
and
oxidative
stress
modulating
interactions
in
the
brain
and
liver
of
rats
,
which
requires
further
exploration
.
Four
major
components
of
the
mechanism
of
action
have
been
identified
for
the
antiparkinsonian
drug
budipine
up
to
now
.

1
)
The
primary
action
of
budipine
is
an
indirect
dopaminergic
effect
as
shown
by
facilitation
of
dopamine
(
DA
)
release
,
inhibition
of
monoamine
oxidase
type
B
(
MAO-B
)
and
of
DA
(
re
)
up-take
and
stimulation
of
aromatic
L-amino
acid
decarboxylase
(
AADC
)
,
which
in
sum
might
be
responsible
for
enhancing
the
endogenous
dopaminergic
activity
.

2
)
Radioligand
and
functional
studies
at
the
N-methyl-D-aspartate
(
NMDA
)
type
glutamate
receptor
characterize
budipine
as
a
low-affinity
,
uncompetitive
antagonist
with
fast
kinetics
and
moderate
voltage-dependency
at
the
phencyclidine
(
PCP
)
binding
site
,
comparable
to
that
observed
with
amantadine
,
thereby
counteracting
an
increased
excitatory
glutamatergic
activity
.

3
)
The
antimuscarinic
action
of
budipine
,
verified
by
functional
and
binding
studies
at
native
muscarinic
M1-M3
and
human
recombinant
m1-m5
receptor
subtypes
in
vitro
,
is
up
to
125-fold
weaker
than
that
of
biperiden
and
corresponds
to
its
approximately
100-fold
lower
potency
to
cause
experimentally-induced
peripheral
antimuscarinic
effects
and
explains
only
part
of
its
high
potency
,
which
equals
biperiden
,
to
suppress
cholinergically
evoked
tremor
.

4
)
An
additional
inhibition
of
striatal
gamma-aminobutyric
acid
(
GABA
)
release
by
budipine
may
be
beneficial
to
suppress
an
increased
striatal
GABAergic
output
activity
.

The
contribution
of
other
observed
effects
to
the
therapeutic
action
of
budipine
,
i
.

e
.

weak
stimulation
of
noradrenaline
and
serotonin
release
,
binding
to
brain
sigma1
receptors
and
blockade
of
histamine
H1
receptors
,
is
not
yet
clear
.

By
means
of
these
multiple
mechanisms
,
budipine
might
correct
the
imbalance
of
striatal
output
pathways
by
restoring
DA
levels
in
the
striatum
,
and
positively
influence
the
secondary
changes
in
other
transmitter
systems
(
glutamate
,
acetylcholine
,
GABA
)
observed
in
Parkinson's
disease
.

.

The
effects
of
two
reversible
,
predominantly
monoamine
oxidase-A
(
MAO-A
)
inhibitors
,
moclobemide
(
150
mg
three
times
daily
)
and
toloxatone
(
400-200-400
mg
day-1
)
on
monoamine
metabolites
and
psychometric
performance
were
compared
in
a
double-blind
placebo
controlled
crossover
study
in
12
healthy
subjects
.

2
.

After
7
days
of
moclobemide
/
toloxatone
/
placebo
administration
subjects
were
hospitalized
for
24
h
on
day
8
.

Blood
samples
were
drawn
every
2
h
for
determination
of
plasma
noradrenaline
(
NA
)
,
3
,
4-dihydroxyphenylglycol
(
DHPG
)
,
homovanillic
acid
(
HVA
)
and
5-hydroxyindolacetic
acid
(
5-HIAA
)
.

Urine
was
collected
for
measurements
of
normetanephrine
and
3-methoxytyramine
excretion
.

Psychometric
performance
(
short-
and
long-term
memory
,
critical
flicker
fusion
frequency
,
choice
reaction
time
)
and
subjective
feelings
were
assessed
before
each
drug
intake
(
in
the
morning
,
at
noon
,
in
the
evening
)
.

3
.

Compared
with
placebo
,
both
reversible
monoamine
oxidase
inhibitors
decreased
the
plasma
concentration
of
DHPG
and
HVA
.

The
overall
fall
in
DHPG
(
AUC
from
0
to
24
h
)
was
44%
during
moclobemide
and
12%
during
toloxatone
(
P
less
than
0
.
001
)
and
the
overall
decrease
in
HVA
was
38%
and
20%
(
P
less
than
0
.
005
)
on
moclobemide
and
toloxatone
,
respectively
.

.

Before
the
next
drug
intake
,
MAO-A
inhibition
,
as
judged
by
the
decrease
of
plasma
DHPG
concentration
,
was
significantly
different
from
placebo
with
moclobemide
but
not
with
toloxatone
.

5
.

Moclobemide
,
but
not
toloxatone
,
exerted
a
moderate
,
but
significant
inhibition
of
the
deamination
of
5-hydroxytryptamine
(
5-HT
)
as
judged
by
the
fall
in
plasma
5-HIAA
concentration
.

Neither
drug
influenced
plasma
NA
concentration
.

6
.

A
significant
rise
in
urinary
excretion
of
normetanephrine
was
observed
on
moclobemide
and
to
a
lesser
extent
on
toloxatone
.

The
urinary
excretion
of
3-methoxytyramine
was
significantly
raised
by
moclobemide
but
not
by
toloxatone
.

7
.

Neither
moclobemide
nor
toloxatone
altered
memory
function
,
vigilance
,
subjective
feelings
or
sleep
characteristics
of
the
subjects
.
Neurotensin
has
been
shown
to
produce
pharmacological
effects
both
in
brain
and
periphery
.

Several
of
these
effects
are
mediated
by
a
high-affinity
neurotensin
NT1
receptor
.

On
the
other
hand
,
a
low-affinity
levocabastine-sensitive
neurotensin
NT2
receptor
was
molecularly
cloned
from
rodent
brain
recently
.

In
this
study
,
in
contrast
to
NT1
receptor
,
levocabastine
(
a
histamine
H1
receptor
antagonist
)
and
SR48692
(
an
antagonist
for
NT1
receptor
)
strongly
stimulated
intracellular
Ca2
+
mobilization
in
transfected
Chinese
hamster
ovary
cells
expressing
rat
NT2
receptor
,
thus
acting
as
potent
NT2
receptor
.

Furthermore
,
despite
of
their
affinities
for
NT2
receptor
,
the
Ca2
+
responses
to
potent
NT1
agonists
,
neurotensin
or
JMV449
(
[
Lys8-
(
CH2NH
)
-Lys9
]
Pro-Tyr-Ile-Leu
,
a
peptidase
resistant
analogue
of
neurotensin
)
were
much
smaller
than
that
observed
with
SR48692
.

These
findings
suggest
that
NT1
and
NT2
receptors
present
distinct
functional
characteristics
and
that
SR48692
may
act
as
a
potent
agonist
for
NT2
receptor
.
The
regulation
of
gonadotropin
synthesis
by
GnRH
plays
an
essential
role
in
the
neuroendocrine
control
of
reproduction
.

The
known
signaling
mechanisms
involved
in
gonadotropin
synthesis
have
been
expanding
.

For
example
,
involvement
of
β-catenin
in
LHβ
induction
by
GnRH
has
been
discovered
.

We
examined
the
role
of
β-catenin
in
FSHβ
gene
expression
in
LβT2
gonadotrope
cells
.

GnRH
caused
a
sustained
increase
in
nuclear
β-catenin
levels
,
which
was
significantly
reduced
by
c-Jun
N-terminal
kinase
(
JNK
)
inhibition
.

Small
interfering
RNA-mediated
knockdown
of
β-catenin
mRNA
demonstrated
that
induction
of
FSHβ
mRNA
by
GnRH
depended
on
β-catenin
and
that
regulation
of
FSHβ
by
β-catenin
occurred
independently
of
the
JNK-c-jun
pathway
.

β-Catenin
depletion
had
no

In

,
GnRH
responsiveness
was
conferred
by
the
proximal
promoter
(
-944

)
and
was
markedly
decreased
by
β-catenin
knockdown
.

However
,
none
of
the
T-cell

in
that

were
required
for
promoter

further
corroborated
the
absence
of
direct
interaction
between
β-catenin
and
the

.

To
elucidate
the
mechanism
for
the
β-catenin
effect
,
we
analyzed
approximately
1
billion
reads
of
next-generation

and
selected
the
nuclear

)
as
one
candidate
for
further
study
.

Subsequent
experiments
confirmed
that
Brms1L
mRNA
expression
was
decreased
by
β-catenin
knockdown
as
well
as
by
JNK
inhibition
.

Furthermore
,
knockdown
of
Brms1L
significantly
attenuated
GnRH-induced
FSHβ
expression
.

Thus
,
our
findings
indicate
that
the
expression
of
Brms1L
depends
on
β-catenin
activity
and
contributes
to
FSHβ
induction
by
GnRH

Organic

With

the

not
by

increased

that

the

These

suggest
that
the

These

found
to
be
strong

All
other
amino

induced
a

From
these

it
may
be
concluded
that

is
coupled

They
can
be
obtained
by
the
action
of

such

We
have
studied
the
enantiospecificities
of
several

been
carried
out
with
pure
enzymes
and
with
an
NADPH-regenerating
system
consisting
of
glucose-6-phosphate
and
glucose-6-phosphate

.

To
ascertain
the
regio

stereoselectivity
of
the
reduction
reactions
catalyzed
by
the
AKRs
,
we
have
separated

characterized
the

by
means
of
a
gas
chromatograph
equipped
with
a
chiral
column
and
coupled
to
a
mass
spectrometer
as
a
detector
.

According
to
the
regioselectivity
and
stereoselectivity
,
the
AKRs
studied
can
be
divided
in
two
groups
:
one
of
them
showed
preference
for
the
reduction
of
the
proximal
keto
group
,
resulting
in
the
S-enantiomer
of
the
corresponding
α-hydroxy
ketones
.

The
other
group
favored
the
reduction
of
the
distal
keto
group
and
yielded
the
corresponding
R-enantiomer
.

Three
of
the
AKRs
used
(

Cadmium
(

is
a
widely
dispersed
environmental
agent
that
causes
oxidative
toxicity
through
mechanisms
that
are
sensitive
to
thioredoxin-1
(
Trx1
)
.

Trx1
is
a
cytoplasmic
protein
that
translocates
to
nuclei
during
oxidative
stress
.

Recent
research
shows
that
interaction
of
Trx1
with
actin
plays
a
critical
role
in
cell
survival
and
that
increased
nuclear
Trx-1
potentiates
proinflammatory
signaling
and
death
in
cell
and
mouse
models
.

These
observations
indicate
that
oxidative
toxicity
caused
by
low-dose
Cd
could
involve
disruption
of
actin-Trx1
interaction
,
nuclear
Trx1
translocation
,
and
potentiation
of
proinflammatory
cell
death
mechanisms
.

In
this
study
,
we
investigated
the
role
of
nuclei-localized
Trx1
in
Cd-induced
inflammation
and
cytotoxicity
using
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
models
.

The
results
show
that
Cd
stimulated
nuclear
translocation
of
Trx1
and
p65
of
NF-κB
.

Elevation
of
Trx1
in
nuclei
in
in
vitro
cells
and
kidney
of

potentiated
Cd-stimulated
NF-κB

.

Cd-stimulated
Trx1
nuclear
translocation
and
NF-κB
activation
were
inhibited
by
cytochalasin
D
,
an
inhibitor
of
actin
polymerization
,
suggesting
that
actin
regulates
Trx1
nuclear
translocation
and
NF-κB
activation
by
Cd
.

A
nuclear-targeted
dominant
negative
form
of
Trx1
blocked
Cd-stimulated
NF-κB
activation
and
decreased
cell
death
.

Addition
of
zinc
,
known
to
antagonize
Cd
toxicity
by
increasing
metallothionein
,
had
no
effect
on
Cd-stimulated
nuclear
translocation
of
Trx1
and
NF-κB
activation
.

Taken
together
,
the
results
show
that
nuclear
translocation
and
accumulation
of
redox-active
Trx1
in
nuclei
play
an
important
role
in
Cd-induced
inflammation

cell

were
cyclized

provided
a

proteases
,
with
the
exception
of
trypsin

which
is
also
inhibited

range
.

Docking
studies
revealed
a
potential
binding
mode
in
the
widely
open

site
of
plasmin
that
explains
the
strong
potency

profile
of
these

The

an
excellent

In

revealed
three

Thus
,
in

a

between

formed
which
was

These

the

AT1-receptor
antagonism
in
hypertension
:
what
has
been
learned
with
The
clinical
benefits
of
endocrine
therapy
for
patients
with
hormonosensitive
breast
cancer
are
well
established
.

For
many
years
,
5
years
of
tamoxifen
was
the
gold
standard
of
adjuvant
treatment
.

The
recent
development
of
new
endocrine
agents
provides
physicians
with
a
more
effective
therapeutic
approach
.

Nevertheless
,
the
success
of
neoadjuvant
endocrine
therapy
is
much
more
recent
and
less
reported
in
the
literature
.

This
article
reviews
the
studies
published
about
neoadjuvant
endocrine
treatment
(
tamoxifen
and
aromatase
inhibitors
)
.

According
to
the
literature
,
neoadjuvant
endocrine
therapy
seems
to
be
effective
.

In
contrast
to
neoadjuvant
chemotherapy
,
neoadjuvant
endocrine
therapy
is
well
tolerated
,
with
very
few
patients
having
to
discontinue
the
treatment
because
of
side
effects
.

It
does
not
constitute
a
standard
treatment
but
could
have
potential
for
elderly
women
with
operable
,
hormonosensitive
,
well
differentiated
and
slowly
progressing
(
SBR
I
)
tumor
or
for
patients
with
lobular
MSBR
1
carcinoma
(
low
chemosensitivity
)
.

The
newer
generation
of
aromatase
inhibitors
(
letrozole
,
anastrozole
,
exemestane
)
appears
to
be
more
active
(
in
terms
of
overall
response
rates
and
conservative
surgery
rate
)
than
tamoxifen
.

Patients
with
an
estrogen
receptor
Allred
score
of
6
and
over
are
more
likely
to
respond
and
gain
a
clinical
benefit
.

The
optimal
duration
of
neoadjuvant
therapy
has
not
yet
been
investigated
in
detail
.

These
preliminary
results
should
be
confirmed
by
further
studies
.

Block
of
human
ether-a-go-go
related
gene
(
hERG
)
K
(
+
)
channels
by
otherwise
useful
drugs
is
the
most
common
cause
of
long
QT
syndrome
,
a
disorder
of
cardiac
repolarization
that
predisposes
patients
to
potentially
fatal
arrhythmias
.

This
undesirable
long
QT
side
effect
has
been
a
major
reason
for
the
withdrawal
of
medications
from
the
pharmaceutical
market
.

Understanding
the
molecular
basis
of
hERG
block
is
therefore
essential
to
facilitate
the
design
of
safe
drugs
.

Binding
sites
for
hERG
blockers
have
been
mapped
within
the
inner
cavity
of
the
channel
and
include
aromatic
residues
in
the
S6
helix
(
Tyr-652
,
Phe-656
)
and
residues
in
the
pore
helix
(
Thr-623
,
Ser-624
,
Val-625
)
.

We
used
mutagenesis
of
these
residues
,
combined
with
an
investigation
of
hERG
block
by
close
analogs
of
clofilium
and
ibutilide
,
to
assess
how
specific
alterations
in
drug
structure
affected
potency
and
binding
interactions
.

Although
changing
the
basic
nitrogen
from
quaternary
to
tertiary
accelerated
the
onset
of
block
,
the
IC
(
50
)
and
kinetics
for
recovery
from
block
were
similar
.

In
contrast
,
analogs
with
different
para-substituents
on
the
phenyl
ring
had
significantly
different
potencies
for
wild-type
hERG
block
.

The
highest
potency
was
achieved
with
polar
or
electronegative
para-substituents
,
whereas
neutral
para-substituents
had
potencies
more
than
100-fold
lower
.

Results
from
mutagenesis
and
molecular
modeling
studies
suggest
that
phenyl
ring
para-substituents
influence
drug
interactions
with
Thr-623
,
Ser-624
,
and
Tyr-652
and
strongly
affect
binding
affinity
.

Together
,
these
findings
suggest
that
modifying
the
para-substituent
could
be
a
useful
strategy
for
reducing
hERG
potency
and
increasing
the
safety
margin
of
compounds
in
development
.
BACKGROUND
:
Characterization
of
novel
rodent
models
for
prostate
cancer
studies
requires
evaluation
of
either
spontaneous
and
carcinogen-induced
tumors
as
well
as
tumor
incidence
in
different
prostatic
lobes
.

We
propose
a
new
short-term
rodent
model
of
chemically
induced
prostate
carcinogenesis
in
which
prostate
cancer
progression
occurs
differentially
in
the
dorsolateral
and
ventral
lobes
.

METHODS
:
Adult
gerbils
were
treated
with
MNU
alone
or
associated
with
testosterone
for
3
or
6
months
of
treatment
.

Tumor
incidence
,
latency
,
localization
,
and
immunohistochemistry
(
AR
,
PCNA
,
smooth
muscle
α-actin
,
p63
,
MGMT
,
and
E-cadherin
)
were
studied
in
both
lobes
.

RESULTS
:
Comparisons
between
both
lobes
revealed
that
lesions
developed
first
in
the
DL
while
the
VL
presented
longer
tumor
latency
.

However
,
after
6
months
,
there
was
a
dramatic
increase
in
tumor
multiplicity
in
the
VL
,
mainly
in
MNU-treated
groups
.

Lesions
clearly
progressed
from
a
premalignant
to
a
malignant
phenotype
over
time
and
tumor
latency
was
decreased
by
MNU
+
testosterone
administration
.

Three-dimensional
reconstruction
of
the
prostatic
complex
showed
that
the
DL
developed
tumors
exclusively
in
the
periurethral
area
and
showed
intense
AR
,
PCNA
,
and
MGMT
immunostaining
.

Moreover
,
VL
lesions
emerged
throughout
the
entire
lobe
.

MNU-induced
lesions
presented
markers
indicative
of
an
aggressive
phenotype
:
lack
of
basal
cells
,
rupture
of
the
smooth
muscle
cell
layer
,
loss
of
E-cadherin
,
and
high
MGMT
staining
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
There
are
distinct
pathways
involved
in
tumor
progression
in
gerbil
prostate
lobes
.

This
animal
provides
a
good
model
for
prostate
cancer
since
it
allows
the
investigation
of
advanced
steps
of
carcinogenesis
with
shorter
latency
periods
in
both
lobes
.

Dithiocarbamates
are
nitrogen-
and
sulfur-containing
compounds
commonly
used
in
pharmacology
,
medicine
and
agriculture
.

The
molecular
effects
of
dithiocarbamates
on
neuronal
cell
systems
are
not
fully
understood
,
especially
in
terms
of
their
ability
to
accumulate
copper
ions
inside
the
cell
.

In
this
work
,
the
molecular
effects
of
N
,
N-diethyldithiocarbamate
(
DEDTC
)
were
studied
in
human
SH-SY5Y
neuroblastoma
cells
to
determine
the
role
of
copper
in
the
DEDTC
toxicity
and
the
pathway
trigged
in
cell
by
the
complex
Cu-DEDTC
.

From
concentration-dependent
studies
,
we
found
that
5
μM
of
this
compound
induced
a
drastic
decrease
in
viable
cells
with
a
concomitant
accumulation
in
intracellular
copper
resulted
from
complexation
with
DEDTC
,
measured
by
atomic
absorption
spectroscopy
.

The
mechanism
of
DEDTC-induced
apoptosis
in
neuronal
model
cells
is
thought
to
occur
through
the
death
receptor
signaling
triggered
by
DEDTC-copper
complex
in
low
concentration
that
is
associated
with
the
activation
of
caspase
8
.

Our
results
indicated
that
the
mechanism
of
cell
death
involves
cytochrome
c
release
forming
the
apoptosome
together
with
Apaf-1
and
caspase
9
,
converting
the
caspase
9
into
its
active
form
,
allowing
it
to
activate
caspase
3
as
observed
by
immunofluorescence
.

This
pathway
is
induced
by
the
cytotoxic
effects
that
occur
when
DEDTC
forms
a
complex
with
the
copper
ions
present
in
the
culture
medium
and
transports
them
into
the
cell
,
suggesting
that
the
DEDTC
by
itself
was
not
able
to
cause
cell
death
and
the
major
effect
is
from
its
copper-complex
in
neuroblastoma
cells
.

The
present
study
suggests
a
role
for
the
influence
of
copper
by
low
concentrations
of
DEDTC
in
the
extracellular
media
,
the
absorption
and
accumulation
of
copper
in
the
cell
and
apoptotic
events
,
induced
by
the
cytotoxic
effects
that
occur
when
DEDTC
forms
a
complex
with
the
copper
ions
.

also

has
been
shown
to
differentially
modulate
the

in
this

AA
and
which
stress
response
hormones
are
involved
remains
to
be
determined
.

By
examining
the
relative
effects
of
corticosterone
(
CORT
)
,
arginine
vasotocin
(
AVT
,
the
avian
homologue
to
arginine
vasopressin
)
and
corticotrophin-releasing
factor
(
CRF
)
,
the
present
study
aimed
to
define
the
hormone
profile
regulating
stress-induced
increases
in
AA
in
the
POM
.

We
found
that
CORT
,
AVT
and
CRF
all
appear
to
play
some
role
in
these
changes
in
the
male
brain
.

In
addition
,
these
effects
occur
in
a
targeted
manner
,
such
that
modulation
of
the
enzyme
by
these
hormones
only
occurs
in
the
POM
rather
than
in
all
aromatase-expressing
nuclei
.

Similarly
,
in
the
female
brain
,
the
experimental
effects
were
restricted
to
the
POM
but
only
CRF
was
capable
of
inducing
the
stress-like
increases
in
AA
.

These
data
further
demonstrate
the
high
degree
of
specificity
(
nuclei-
,
sex-
and
hormone-specific
effects
)
in
this
system
,
highlighting
the
complexity
of
the
stress-aromatase
link
and
suggesting
modes
through
which
the
nongenomic
modulation
of
this
enzyme
can
result
in
targeted
,
rapid
changes
in
local
oestrogen
concentrations

Differential

cells
upon
leptin
stimulation
.
The
glucose
analog
streptozotocin
(
STZ
)
has
long
been
used
as
a
tool
for
creating
experimental
diabetes
because
of
its
relatively
specific
beta-cell
cytotoxic
effect
,
but
the
mechanism
by
which
systemic
injection
of
STZ
causes
beta-cell
destruction
is
not
well
understood
.

In
the
current
study
,
we
have
used
insulinoma
(
RIN
)
and
AtT-20ins
cell
lines
engineered
for
overexpression
of
GLUT2
or
GLUT1
to
investigate
the
role
of
glucose
transporter
isoforms
in
mediating
STZ
cytotoxicity
.

The
in
vivo
effects
of
STZ
were
evaluated
by
implantation
of
RIN
cells
expressing
or
lacking
GLUT2
into
athymic
nude
rats
.

The
drug
had
a
potent
cytotoxic
effect
on
RIN
cells
expressing
GLUT2
,
but
had
no
effect
on
cells
lacking
GLUT2
expression
,
as
indicated
by
histological
analysis
and
measurement
of
the
blood
glucose
levels
of
treated
animals
.

The
preferential
cytotoxic
effect
of
STZ
on
GLUT2-expressing
cell
lines
was
confirmed
by
in
vitro
analysis
of
GLUT2-expressing
and
untransfected
RIN
cells
,
as
well
as
GLUT2-
and
GLUT1-overexpressing
AtT-20ins
cells
.

Consistent
with
these
data
,
only
GLUT2-expressing
RIN
or
AtT-20ins
cells
transported
STZ
efficiently
.

We
conclude
that
expression
of
GLUT2
is
required
for
efficient
killing
of
neuroendocrine
cells
by
STZ
,
and
this
effect
is
related
to
specific
recognition
of
the
drug
as
a
transported
substrate
by
GLUT2
but
not
GLUT1
.
Prolyl-hydroxylase

.
PURPOSE
:
The
fluoropyrimidine
carbamate
(
capecitabine
)
is
converted
to
5-fluorouracil
(
5-FU
)
by
thymidine
phosphorylase
(
TP
)
inside
target
tissues
.

5-FU
interferes
with
DNA
synthesis
by
blocking
thymidylate
synthase
(
TS
)
but
is
inactivated
by
dihydropyrimidine
dehydrogenase
(
DPD
)
.

Favorable
enzyme
profiles
(
high
TP
and
low
DPD
)
generate
high
intratumor
levels
of
5-FU
that
are
effective
against
many
tumors
,
especially
those
with
low
TS
.

Capecitabine
has
not
been
tested
against
thyroid
cancers
,
and
it
is
not
known
to
what
extent
thyroid
cancers
express
TP
,
TS
or
DPD
.

METHODS
:
To
test
this
,
we
determined
TP
,
TS
and
DPD
in
19
thyroid
cancers
from
young
patients
(
14
papillary
,
4
follicular
,
1
medullary
)
by
immunohistochemistry
.

After
approval
by
the
Human
Use
Committee
,
the
intensity
of
TP
,
TS
,
and
DPD
staining
was
determined
by
two
independent
examiners
and
graded
(
absent
=
0
to
intense
=
3
)
with
>90%
concordance
.

RESULTS
:
TS
was
detected
in
7
/
19
cancers
(
37%
)
,
TP
in
14
/
19
cancers
(
74%
)
and
DPD
in
14
/
19
cancers
(
74%
)
.

In
six
tumors
,
TP
was
more
intense
that
DPD
,
suggesting
capecitabine
sensitivity
.

Only
five
tumors
failed
to
express
TP
but
four
of
these
expressed
DPD
,
suggesting
capecitabine
resistance
.

Overall
,
6
/
19
tumors
(
32%
of
the
total
)
had
a
favorable
expression
profile
,
and
all
of
them
were
papillary
cancers
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
We
conclude
that
the
majority
of
differentiated
thyroid
cancers
(
74%
)
express
TP
and
low
levels
of
TS
(
63%
undetectable
)
.

The
results
support
the
hypothesis
that
capecitabine
is
activated
in
the
majority
of
differentiated
thyroid
cancers
and
that
32%
have
favorable
expression
of
all
three
enzymes
(
TP
,
TS
,
and
DPD
)
.
The
effect
of
a
21-day
treatment
with
the
dual
5-HT
and
NE

venlafaxine
(

by
osmotic
minipumps
)
was
assessed
on
the
time
required
for
a
50%
recovery
(
RT
(
50
)
)
of
the
firing
activity
of
dorsal
hippocampus
CA
(
3
)
pyramidal
neurons
from
the
suppression
induced
by
microiontophoretic
applications
of
5-HT
and
NE
.

The
RT
(
50
)
values
for
5-HT
were
increased
by
both
10
and
40
mg
/
kg
/
day
regimens
of
venlafaxine
,
whereas
those
for
NE
were
increased
only
by
the
40
mg
/
kg
/
day
regimen
,
indicative
of
a
greater
potency
of
venlafaxine
in
blocking
5-HT
reuptake
.

The
sensitivity
of
the
postsynaptic
5-HT
(
1A
)
and
alpha
(
2
)
-adrenergic
receptors
was
altered
by
neither
regimen
of
venlafaxine
.

Using
a
paradigm
by
which
the
5-HT
(
1A
)
antagonist
WAY
100635
can
induce
a
disinhibition
of
firing
activity
of
CA
(
3
)
pyramidal
neurons
,
it
was
demonstrated
that
the
high
,
but
not
the
low
,
dose
of
venlafaxine
led
to
an
enhanced
tonic
activation
of
postsynaptic
5-HT
(
1A
)
receptors
in
the
dorsal
hippocampus
.

The
duration
of
the
suppressant
effect
of
the
firing
activity
of
CA
(
3
)
hippocampus
pyramidal
neurons
produced
by
the
electrical
stimulation
of
the
ascending
5-HT
pathway
was
significantly
reduced
when
the
frequency
of
the
stimulation
was
enhanced
from
1
Hz
to
5
Hz
in
control
rats
and
in
rats
treated
with
10
mg
/
kg
/
day
,
but
not
with
40
mg
/
kg
/
day
of
venlafaxine
.

Hence
,
venlafaxine
induced
a
desensitization
of
the
terminal
5-HT
(
1B
)
autoreceptor
only
at
the
high
dose
.

A
2-day
treatment
with
10
mg
/
kg
/
day
of
venlafaxine
induced
a
suppression
of
the
firing
activity
of
5-HT
neurons
of
the
dorsal
raphe
.

The
firing
activity
of
these
neurons
was
back
to
control
level
in
rats
that
had
been
treated
for
21
days
with
the
same
dose
of
venlafaxine
.

The
suppressant
effect
of
the
i
.

v
.

administration
of
the
5-HT
autoreceptor
agonist
LSD
on
the
firing
activity
of
dorsal
raphe
5-HT
neurons
was
reduced
in
rats
that
had
been
treated
for
21
days
with
10
mg
/
kg
/
day
of
venlafaxine
.

A
2-day
treatment
with
40
mg
/
kg
/
day
of
venlafaxine
,
unlike
the
10
mg
/
kg
/
day
regimen
,
induced
a
marked
suppression
of
the
firing
activity
of
locus
coeruleus
NE
neurons
.

However
,
in
contrast
to
5-HT
neurons
,
NE
neurons
did
not
recover
their
firing
activity
after
a
21-day
treatment
.

Taken
together
,
the
results
from
this
study
indicate
that
the
low
dose
of
venlafaxine
blocked
selectively
the
reuptake
of
5-HT
,
whereas
the
high
dose
blocked
the
reuptake
of
both
5-HT
and
NE
.

Moreover
,
an
enhancement
of
serotonergic
neurotransmission
by
venlafaxine
was
only
achieved
under
conditions
whereby
the
desensitization
of
the
terminal
5-HT
(
1B
)
autoreceptor
is
appended
to
that
of
the
somatodendritic
5-HT
(
1A
)
receptor
.
PURPOSE
:
The
vascular
endothelial
growth
factor
receptor-2
(
VEGFR2
)
tyrosine
kinase
has
been
implicated
in
the
pathologic
angiogenesis
associated
with
tumor
growth
.

YM-359445
was
a

-ylidene-1
,
3-dihydro-2H-indol-2-one
derivative
found
while
screening
based
on
the
inhibition
of

.

The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
analyze
the
efficacy
of
this
compound
both
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
.

EXPERIMENTAL
DESIGN
:
We
tested
the
effects
of
YM-359445
on
VEGFR2
tyrosine
kinase
activity
,
cell
proliferation
,
and
angiogenesis
.

The
antitumor
activity
of
YM-359445
was
also
tested
in
nude
mice
bearing
various
established
tumors
and
compared
with
other
VEGFR2
tyrosine
kinase
inhibitors
(
ZD6474
,
CP-547632
,
CGP79787
,
SU11248
,
and
AZD2171
)
,
a
cytotoxic
agent
(
paclitaxel
)
,
and
an
epidermal
growth
factor
receptor
tyrosine
kinase
inhibitor
(
gefitinib
)
.

RESULTS
:
The
IC50
of
YM-359445
for
VEGFR2
tyrosine
kinase
was
0
.
0085
micromol
/
L
.

In
human
vascular
endothelial
cells
,
the
compound
inhibited
VEGF-dependent
proliferation
,
VEGFR2
autophosphorylation
,
and
sprout
formation
at
concentrations
of
0
.
001
to
0

003
micromol
/
L
.

These
concentrations
had
no
direct
cytotoxic
effect
on
cancer
cells
.

In
mice
bearing
various
established
tumors
,
including
paclitaxel-resistant
tumors
,
once
daily
oral
administration
of
YM-359445
at
doses
of
0
.
5
to
4
mg
/
kg
not
only
inhibited
tumor
growth
but
also
reduced
its
vasculature
.

YM-359445
had
greater
antitumor
activity
than
other
VEGFR2
tyrosine
kinase
inhibitors
.

Moreover
,
in
human
lung
cancer
A549
xenografts
,
YM-359445
markedly
regressed
the
tumors
(
73%
)
at
a
dose
of
4
mg
/
kg
,
whereas
gefitinib
caused
no
regression
even
at
100
mg
/
kg
.

CONCLUSION
:
Our
results
show
that
YM-359445
is
more
potent
than
orally
bioavailable
VEGFR2
tyrosine
kinase
inhibitors
,
which
leads
to
great
expectations
for
clinical
applicability

was
unable

In
conclusion
,
both
NPR-A-
and
NPR-B-linked
pGC
pathways
are
modulated
by
NO-cGMP
in
murine
aorta
and
mesenteric
small
arteries
and
crossdesensitisation
occurs
between
NPR
subtypes
.

The
biological
activity
of
endothelium-derived
NO
is
also
influenced
by
the
ambient
concentration
of
NO
and
natriuretic
peptides
.

Such

may
represent
an
important

BACKGROUND
:
Strong
evidence
suggests
that
mitochondrial
malfunction
,
which
leads
to
disturbed
energy
metabolism
and
stimulated
apoptosis
,
is
a
linchpin
in
the
induction
and
manifestation
of
cardiac
failure
.

An
adequate
exchange
of
ATP
and
ADP
over
the
inner
mitochondrial
membrane
by
the
adenine
nucleotide
translocase
(
ANT
)
is
thereby
essential
to
guarantee
the
cellular
energy
supply
.

METHODS
AND
RESULTS
:
To
explore
the
effect
of
an
ameliorated
mitochondrial
ATP
/
ADP
transportation
on
cardiac
dysfunction
,
we
generated
transgenic
rats
overexpressing
ANT1
in
the
heart
(
ANT
rats
)
and
crossed
them
with
renin-overexpressing
rats
(
REN
rats
)
suffering
from
hypertension-induced
cardiac
insufficiency
.

Cardiac-specific
ANT1
overexpression
resulted
in
a
higher
ATP
/
ADP
transportation
and
elevated
activities
of
respiratory
chain
complexes
.

Increased
ANT
activity
in
double-transgenic
(
ANT
/
REN
)
animals
did
not
influence
excessive
hypertension
seen
in
REN
rats
.

Hypertension-induced
cardiac
hypertrophy
in
the
REN
rats
was
prevented
by
parallel
ANT1
overexpression
,
however
,
and
left
ventricular
function
remarkably
improved
.

The
ANT1
overexpression
led
to
a
reduction
in
fibrosis
and
an
improvement
in
cardiac
tissue
architecture
.

Consequently
,
the
survival
rate
of
ANT
/
REN
rats
was
enhanced
.

Further
investigations
into
the
cardioprotective
mechanism
of
ANT1
overexpression
revealed
improved
mitochondrial
structure
and
function
and
significantly
reduced
apoptosis
in
ANT
/
REN
rats
,
shown
by
lowered
cytosolic
/
mitochondrial
cytochrome
c
ratio
,
reduced
caspase
3
level
,
and
prevented
DNA
degradation
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
Myocardial
ANT1
overexpression
protects
against
hypertension-induced
cardiac
pathology
.

Thus
,
the
improvement
in
mitochondrial
function
may
be
a
basic
principle
for
new
strategies
in
treating
heart
disease
.

solubility
.
To
evaluate
the
cytokine
balance
and
enzymatic
alterations
induced
by
environmental
pesticide
exposure
during
pregnancy
,
this
transversal
study
explored
placentas
derived
from
non-exposed
women
(
control
group-CG
)
,
and
from
women
living
in
a
rural
area
(
rural
group-RG
)
,
collected
during
intensive
organophosphate
(
OP
)
pesticide
spraying
season
(
RG-SS
)
and
during
non-spraying
season
(
RG-NSS
)
.

The
exposure
biomarkers
blood
cholinesterase
and
placental
carboxylesterase
(
CaE
)
were
significantly
decreased
in
RG-SS
.

Among
the
cytokines
studied
IL-8
,
IL-6
,
TNFα
,
IL-10
,
TGFβ
and
IL-13
,
the
expression
frequency
of
IL-13
increased
in
RG-SS
.

Arginase
and
ornithine
decarboxylase
(
ODC
)
enzymes
were
induced
in
syncytiotrophoblast
and
endothelial
cells
.

Interestingly
,
the
decrease
in
CaE
activity
was
associated
with
arginase
and
ODC
activity
induction
.

These
findings
suggest
that
environmental
pesticide
exposure
impacts
the
placenta
by
increasing
the
expression
frequency
of
the
anti-inflammatory
cytokine
IL-13
,
which
may
be
related
to
the
up-regulation
of
enzymes
implicated
in
tissue
repair
.
Levodopa
has
been
the
gold
standard
therapy
for
the
motor
symptoms
of
Parkinson's
disease
for
more
than
three
decades
.

Although
it
remains
the
most
effective
treatment
,
its
long-term
use
is
associated
with
motor
fluctuations
and
dyskinesias
that
can
be
disabling
for
patients
and
difficult
for
physicians
to
manage
medically
.

In
the
last
10
years
,
the
catechol-O-methyltransferase
(
COMT
)
inhibitor
tolcapone
has
been
studied
for
its
efficacy
as
an
adjunctive
treatment
to
levodopa
plus
a
dopa
decarboxylase
inhibitor
.

Adjunctive
therapy
with
tolcapone
can
significantly
reduce
the
dose
of
levodopa
required
.

Moreover
,
treatment
with
tolcapone
significantly
reduces
wearing
off
and
on-off
periods
in
fluctuating
patients
and
improves
'on'
time
in
patients
with
stable
disease
.

Tolcapone
has
assumed
a
new
place
in
the
arsenal
of
medications
for
Parkinson's
disease
.

This
paper
reviews
the
pharmacology
,
safety
and
efficacy
of
tolcapone
in
patients
with
advanced
Parkinson's
disease
.

After
some
initial
concerns
about
its
safety
,
tolcapone
has
been
shown
to
be
safe
if
used
and
monitored
according
to
guidelines
regarding
liver
function
.

Tolcapone
produces
expected
dopaminergic
side
effects
,
including
headache
,
nausea
,
insomnia
,
as
well
as
diarrhea;
however
,
these
side
effects
are
generally
mild
and
as
a
rule
do
not
result
in
discontinuation
of
therapy
.
During
repetitive
stimulation
of
skeletal
muscle
,
extracellular
ATP
levels
raise
,
activating
purinergic
receptors
,
increasing
Ca
(
2
+
)
influx
,
and
enhancing
contractile
force
,
a
response
called
potentiation
.

We
found
that
ATP
appears
to
be
released
through
pannexin1
hemichannels
(
Panx1
HCs
)
.

Immunocytochemical
analyses
and
function
were
consistent
with
pannexin1
localization
to
T-tubules
intercalated
with
dihydropyridine
and
ryanodine
receptors
in
slow
(
soleus
)
and
fast
(
extensor
digitorum
longus
,
EDL
)
muscles
.

Isolated
myofibers
took
up
ethidium
(
Etd
(
+
)
)
and
released
small
molecules
(
as
ATP
)
during
electrical
stimulation
.

Consistent
with
two
glucose
uptake
pathways
,
induced
uptake
of
2-NBDG
,
a
fluorescent
glucose
derivative
,
was
decreased
by
inhibition
of
HCs
or
glucose
transporter
(
GLUT4
)
,
and
blocked
by
dual
blockade
.

Adult
skeletal
muscles
apparently
do
not
express
connexins
,
making
it
unlikely
that
connexin
hemichannels
contribute
to
the
uptake
and
release
of
small
molecules
.

ATP
release
,
Etd
(
+
)
uptake
,
and
potentiation
induced
by
repetitive
electrical
stimulation
were
blocked
by
HC
blockers
and
did
not
occur
in
muscles
of
pannexin1
knockout
mice
.

MRS2179
,
a
P2Y1R
blocker
,
prevented
potentiation
in
EDL
,
but
not
soleus
muscles
,
suggesting
that
in
fast
muscles
ATP
activates
P2Y1
but
not
P2X
receptors
.

Phosphorylation
on
Ser
and
Thr
residues
of
pannexin1
was
increased
during
potentiation
,
possibly
mediating
HC
opening
.

Opening
of
Panx1
HCs
during
repetitive
activation
allows
efflux
of
ATP
,
influx
of
glucose
and
possibly
Ca
(
2
+
)
too
,
which
are
required
for
potentiation
of
contraction
.

Chronic
,
non-acute
inflammation
is
behind
conditions
that
represent
most
of
the
disease
burden
in
humans
and
is
clearly
linked
to
immune
and
metabolic
mechanisms
.

The
convergence
of
pathways
involving
the
immune
response
,
oxidative
stress
,
increased
circulating
lipids
and
aberrant
insulin
signaling
results
in
CCL2-associated
macrophage
recruitment
and
altered
energy
metabolism
.

The
CCL2
/
CCR2
pathway
and
the
energy
sensor
AMP-activated
protein
kinase
(
AMPK
)
are
attractive
therapeutic
targets
as
a
part
of
preventive
management
of
disease
.

Several
effects
of
polyphenols
are
useful
in
this
scenario
,
including
a
reduction
in
the
activities
of
cytokines
and
modulation
of
cellular
metabolism
through
histone
deacetylase
inhibitors
,
AMPK
activators
,
calorie-restriction
mimetics
or
epigenetic
regulators
.

Research
is
currently
underway
to
develop
orally
active
drugs
with
these
effects
,
but
it
is
convenient
to
examine
more
closely
what
we
are
eating
.

If
a
lack
of
relevance
in
terms
of
toxicity
and
substantial
effectiveness
are
confirmed
,
plant-derived
components
may
provide
useful
druggable
components
and
dietary
supplements
.

We
consider
therapeutic
actions
as
a
combination
of
synergistic
and
/
or
antagonistic
interactions
in
a
multi-target
strategy
.

Hence
,
improvement
in
food
through
enrichment
with
polyphenols
with
demonstrated
activity
may
represent
a
major
advance
in
the
design
of
diets
with
both
industrial
and
sanitary
value
.

A
second
isoform
of
the
human
vesicular
monoamine
transporter
(
hVMAT
)
has
been
cloned
from
a
pheochromocytoma
cDNA
library
.

The
contribution
of
the
two
transporter
isoforms
to
monoamine
storage
in
human
neuroendocrine
tissues
was
examined
with
isoform-specific
polyclonal
antibodies
against
hVMAT1
and
hVMAT2
.

Central
,
peripheral
,
and
enteric
neurons
express
only
VMAT2
.

VMAT1
is
expressed
exclusively
in
neuroendocrine
,
including
chromaffin
and
enterochromaffin
,
cells
.

VMAT1
and
VMAT2
are
coexpressed
in
all
chromaffin
cells
of
the
adrenal
medulla
.

VMAT2
alone
is
expressed
in
histamine-storing
enterochromaffin-like
cells
of
the
oxyntic
mucosa
of
the
stomach
.

The
transport
characteristics
and
pharmacology
of
each
VMAT
isoform
have
been
directly
compared
after
expression
in
digitonin-permeabilized
fibroblastic
(
CV-1
)
cells
,
providing
information
about
substrate
feature
recognition
by
each
transporter
and
the
role
of
vesicular
monoamine
storage
in
the
mechanism
of
action
of
psychopharmacologic
and
neurotoxic
agents
in
human
.

Serotonin
has
a
similar
affinity
for
both
transporters
.

Catecholamines
exhibit
a
3-fold
higher
affinity
,
and
histamine
exhibits
a
30-fold
higher
affinity
,
for
VMAT2
.

Reserpine
and
ketanserin
are
slightly
more
potent
inhibitors
of
VMAT2-mediated
transport
than
of
VMAT1-mediated
transport
,
whereas
tetrabenazine
binds
to
and
inhibits
only
VMAT2
.

N-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium
,
phenylethylamine
,
amphetamine
,
and
methylenedioxymethamphetamine
are
all
more
potent
inhibitors
of
VMAT2
than
of
VMAT1
,
whereas
fenfluramine
is
a
more
potent
inhibitor
of
VMAT1-mediated
monamine
transport
than
of
VMAT2-mediated
monoamine
transport
.

The
unique
distributions
of
hVMAT1
and
hVMAT2
provide
new
markers
for
multiple
neuroendocrine
lineages
,
and
examination
of
their
transport
properties
provides
mechanistic
insights
into
the
pharmacology
and
physiology
of
amine
storage
in
cardiovascular
,

Angiogenesis
is
tightly
associated
with
the
outgrowth
of
adipose
tissue
,
leading
to
obesity
,
which
is
a
risk
factor
for
type
2
diabetes
and
hypertension
,
mainly
because
expanding
adipose
tissue
requires
an
increased
nutrient
supply
from
blood
vessels
.

Therefore
,
induction
of
vessel
abnormality
by
adipokines
has
been
well
studied
,
whereas
how
altered
vascular
function
promotes
obesity
is
relatively
unexplored
.

Also
,
surviving
Prox1
heterozygous
mice
showed
abnormal
lymphatic
patterning
and
adult-onset
obesity
,
indicating
that
accumulation
of
adipocytes
could
be
closely
linked
with
lymphatic
function
.

Here
we
propose
a
new
anti-obesity
strategy
based
on
enhancement
of
lymphatic
and
blood
vessel
integrity
with
apelin
.

Apelin-knockout
mice
given
a
high-fat
diet
showed
an
obese
phenotype
associated
with
abnormal
lymphatic
and
blood
vessel
enlargement
.

Fatty
acids
present
in
the
high-fat
diet
induced
hyperpermeability
of
endothelial
cells
,
causing
adipocyte
differentiation
,
whereas
apelin
promoted
vascular
stabilization
.

Moreover
,
treatment
of
high-fat-diet-fed
apelin-knockout
mice
with
a
selective
cyclooxygenase-2
inhibitor
,
celecoxib
,
improved
vascular
function
,
and
also
attenuated
obesity
.

Finally
,
apelin
transgenic
mice
showed
decreased
subcutaneous
adipose
tissue
owing
to
inhibition
of
high-fat-diet-induced
hyperpermeability
of
vessels
.

These
results
indicate
that
apelin
inhibits
high-fat-diet-induced
obesity
by
enhancing
vessel
integrity
.

Apelin
could
serve
as
a
therapeutic
target
for
treating
obesity
and
related
diseases
.
Polycomb

complex

(
PRC1
)
catalyzes
lysine
119
monoubiquitylation
on
H2A
(
H2AK119ub1
)
and
regulates
pluripotency
in
embryonic
stem
cells
(
ESCs
)
.

However
,
the
mechanisms
controlling
the
binding
of
PRC1
to
genomic
sites
and
its
catalytic
activity
are
poorly
understood
.

Here
,
we
show
that
Fbxl10
interacts
with
Ring1B
and
Nspc1
,
forming
a
noncanonical
PRC1
that
is
required
for
H2AK119ub1
in
mouse
ESCs
.

Genome-wide
analyses
reveal
that
Fbxl10
preferentially
binds
to
CpG
islands
and
colocalizes
with
Ring1B
on
Polycomb
target
genes
.

Notably
,
Fbxl10
depletion
causes
a
decrease
in
Ring1B
binding
to
target
genes
and
a
major
loss
of
H2AK119ub1
.

Furthermore
,
genetic
analyses
demonstrate
that
Fbxl10
DNA
binding
capability
and
integration
into
PRC1
are
required
for
H2AK119
ubiquitylation
.

ESCs
lacking
Fbxl10
,
like
previously
characterized
Polycomb
mutants
,
cannot
differentiate
properly
.

These
results
demonstrate
that
Fbxl10
has
a
key
role
in
regulating
Ring1B
recruitment
to
its
target
genes
and
H2AK119
ubiquitylation
in
ESCs
.

Whereas

The

Catalase

activity
was
activated
significantly
when
the
REE
concentration
range
from
0

300
μM
,
whereas
no
significant
changes
were
found
in
superoxide

activity
.

Differences
of
esterase
isozymes
under
REE
treatment
only
laid
in
expression

,
and
there
were
no
specific
bands
.

The
expression
level
of
some
POD
isozymes
strengthened
with
increasing
concentration
of
REEs
within
the
range
of
50-200
μM

When
REE
concentration
was
higher

,
the

was
inhibited;
meanwhile
,
some

were
induced
.

Our
results
also
showed
REEs
did
not
directly
influence
PAL

So
,
we
speculated
that
50-200
μM

could
activate
some
of

,
adjust

Organophosphorus
compounds
(
OPs
)
cause
neurotoxic
disorders
through
interactions
with
well-known
target
esterases
,
such
as
acetylcholinesterase
and
neuropathy
target
esterase
(
NTE
)
.

However
,
the
OPs
can
potentially
interact
with
other
esterases
of
unknown
significance
.

Therefore
,
identifying
,
characterizing
and
elucidating
the
nature
and
functional
significance
of
the
OP-sensitive
pool
of
esterases
in
the
central
and
peripheral
nervous
systems
need
to
be
investigated
.

Kinetic
models
have
been
developed
and
applied
by
considering
multi-enzymatic
systems
,
inhibition
,
spontaneous
reactivation
,
the
chemical
hydrolysis
of
the
inhibitor
and
"ongoing
inhibition"
(
inhibition
during
the
substrate
reaction
time
)
.

These
models
have
been
applied
to
discriminate
enzymatic
components
among
the
esterases
in
nerve
tissues
of
adult
chicken
,
this
being
the
experimental
model
for
delayed
neuropathy
and
to
identify
different
modes
of
interactions
between
OPs
and
soluble
brain
esterases
.

The
covalent
interaction
with
the
substrate
catalytic
site
has
been
demonstrated
by
time-progressive
inhibition
during
ongoing
inhibition
.

The
interaction
of
sequential
exposure
to
an
esterase
inhibitor
has
been
tested
in
brain
soluble
fraction
where
exposure
to
one
inhibitor
at
a
non
inhibitory
concentration
has
been
seen
to
modify
sensitivity
to
further
exposure
to
others
.

The
effect
has
been
suggested
to
be
caused
by
interaction
with
sites
other
than
the
inhibition
site
at
the
substrate
catalytic
site
.

This
kind
of
interaction
among
esterase
inhibitors
should
be
considered
to
study
the
potentiation
/
promotion
phenomenon
,
which
is
observed
when
some
esterase
inhibitors
enhance
the
severity
of
the
OP
induced

they
are
dosed

)
is
important
for
cell
growth
,
survival
,
and
motility
and
is
functionally
linked
to
the
signaling
pathway
of
VEGF
,
which
is
widely
recognized
as
a
key
effector
in
angiogenesis
and
cancer
progression
.

Dysregulation
of
the
MET
/
VEGF
axis
is
found
in
a
number
of
human
malignancies
and
has
been
associated
with
tumorigenesis
.

Cabozantinib
(
XL184
)
is
a
small-molecule
kinase
inhibitor
with
potent
activity
toward
MET
and
VEGF
receptor
2
(
VEGFR2
)
,
as
well
as
a
number
of
other
receptor
tyrosine
kinases
that
have
also
been
implicated
in
tumor
pathobiology
,
including
RET
,
KIT
,
AXL
,
and
FLT3
.

Treatment
with
cabozantinib
inhibited
MET
and
VEGFR2
phosphorylation
in
vitro
and
in
tumor
models
in
vivo
and
led
to
significant
reductions
in
cell
invasion
in
vitro
.

In
mouse
models
,
cabozantinib
dramatically
altered
tumor
pathology
,
resulting
in
decreased
tumor
and
endothelial
cell
proliferation
coupled
with
increased
apoptosis
and
dose-dependent
inhibition
of
tumor
growth
in
breast
,
lung
,
and
glioma
tumor
models
.

Importantly
,
treatment
with
cabozantinib
did
not
increase
lung
tumor
burden
in
an
experimental
model
of
metastasis
,
which
has
been
observed
with
inhibitors
of
VEGF
signaling
that
do
not
target
MET
.

Collectively
,
these
data
suggest
that
cabozantinib
is
a
promising
agent
for
inhibiting
tumor
angiogenesis
and
metastasis
in
cancers
with
dysregulated
MET
and
VEGFR
signaling
.

Drug
concentrations
measured

decreased

,
a
finding
indicating

ABSTRACT
TRUNCATED

Characteristic
molecular

for
the
early
detection
and
prediction
of
polycyclic
aromatic
hydrocarbons
in
rat
liver
.
Protein
kinase
CK2
(
Casein
Kinase
2
)
is
an
essential
,
ubiquitous
and
highly
pleiotropic
protein
kinase
,
implicated
in
several
human
diseases
.

In
the
last
decade
,
several
inhibitors
of
CK2
,
have
been
discovered
and
characterized
to
be
ATP-competitive
compounds
.

However
,
only
one
of
them
,
CX-4945
,
has
recently
completed
Phase
I
clinical
trial
as
potential
anticancer
drug
.

In
this
review
,
we
report
all
chemical
classes
of
CK2
inhibitors
available
in
literature
,
focusing
our
attention
on
conventional
ATP-competitive
and
on
non
ATP-competitive
inhibitors
,
which
could
represent
a
new
frontier
in
CK2
inhibition
and
,
consequently
,
a
promising
field
of
study
in
discovering
new
drug
candidates
.
Monoamine
oxidase
inhibitors
(
MAOIs
)
exert
their
antidepressant
action
by
increasing
the
function
of
the
serotonin
(
5-HT
)
,
norepinephrine
and
dopamine
(
DA
)
systems
.

There
is
,
however
,
limited
electrophysiological
data
on
the
effects
of
MAOIs
on
DA
neurons
.

The
effects
of
2-d
and
21-d
administration
of
three
MAOIs
were
investigated
(
clorgyline
,
selective
MAOI-A;
deprenyl
,
selective
MAOI-B;
phenelzine
,
non-selective
MAOI
)
on
the
firing
activity
of
DA
neurons
in
the
ventral
tegmental
area
using
in-vivo
electrophysiology
in
rats
.

Short-term
clorgyline
(
1
mg
/
kg
)
and
phenelzine
(
2
.
5
mg
/
kg
)
was
devoid
of
effect
on
DA
neurons
,
whereas
prolonged
administration
significantly
decreased
their
firing
rate
(
by
30%
and
20%
,
respectively
)
,
number
of
bursts
(
by
80%
and
45%
,
respectively
)
,
and
percentage
of
spikes
occurring
in
bursts
only
in
clorgyline-treated
rats
(
70%
)
.

Deprenyl
(
0
.
25
mg
/
kg
)
was
without
effects
.

DA
firing
was
restored
in
clorgyline-treated
rats
by
inhibiting
5-HT
synthesis
using
para-chlorophenylalanine
(
p-CPA;
300
mg
/
kg
.

d
for
three
consecutive
days
)
.

The
5-HT3
antagonist
ondansetron
(
0
.
5
mg
/
kg
)
was
devoid
of
effect
in
control
rats
,
but
completely
reversed
the
alterations
of
DA
neuronal
activity
in
clorgyline-treated
rats
.

An
attenuation
of
DA
neuronal
activity
was
thus
produced
by
prolonged
blockade
of
MAOA
activity
.

The
absence
of
effect
of
MAOA
inhibition
after
subacute
administration
suggested
an
indirect
mechanism
.

This
was
confirmed
by
the
observation
that
p-CPA
antagonized
the
effects
of
clorgyline
.

Since
ondansetron
completely
reversed
the
effects
of
clorgyline
on
DA
neuronal
activity
,
the
effects
of
MAOA
inhibition
appeared
to
be
mediated
by
5-HT3
receptors
.

produced

No

The

were

)
.

Efficacy
was

,
with
a

In
conclusion
,
the
novel
AT1-receptor
antagonist
SC-52458
is
well
tolerated
and
orally
active
.

It
produces
a
rapid-onset
inhibition
of
the
renin-angiotensin
system
and
reduces
BP
response
to
Ang
II
for

.

These
characteristics
promise
strong
antihypertensive
properties
for
SC-52458
.
Cellular
damage
from
ionizing
radiation
(
IR
)
is
in
part
due
to
DNA
damage
and
reactive
oxygen
species
,
which
activate
DNA
damage
response
(
DDR
)
and
cytokine
signaling
pathways
,
including
the
ataxia
telangiectasia
mutated
(
ATM
)
and
transforming
growth
factor
(
TGF
)
β
/
Smad
pathways
.

Using
classic
double-strand
breaks
(
DSBs
)
markers
,
we
studied
the
roles
of
Smad
proteins
in
DDR
and
the
crosstalk
between
TGFβ
and
ATM
pathways
.

We
observed
co-localization
of
phospho-Smad2
(
pSmad2
)
and
Smad7
with
DSB
repair
proteins
following
low
and
high
linear
energy
transfer
(
LET
)
radiation
in
human
fibroblasts
and
epithelial
cells
.

The
decays
of
both
foci
were
similar
to
that
of
γH2AX
foci
.

Irradiation
with
high
LET
particles
induced
pSmad2
and
Smad7
foci
tracks
indicating
the
particle
trajectory
through
cells
.

pSmad2
foci
were
absent
in
S
phase
cells
,
while
Smad7
foci
were
present
in
all
phases
of
cell
cycle
.

pSmad2
(
but
not
Smad7
)
foci
were
completely
abolished
when
ATM
was
depleted
or
inactivated
.

In
contrast
,
a
TGFβ
receptor
1
(
TGFβR1
)
inhibitor
abrogated
Smad7
,
but
not
pSmad2
foci
at
DSBs
sites
.

In
summary
,
we
suggest
that
Smad2
and
Smad7
contribute
to
IR-induced
DSB
signaling
in
an
ATM
or
TGFβR1-dependent
manner
,
respectively
.

The
expression
of
cyclooxygenase-2
(
COX-2
)
is
a
characteristic
response
to
inflammation
and
can
be
inhibited
with
sodium
salicylate
.

TNF-alpha
plus
IFN-gamma
can
induce
extracellular
signal-regulated
kinase
(
ERK
)
,
IKK
,
IkappaB
degradation
and
NF-kappaB
activation
.

The
inhibition
of
the
ERK
pathway
with
selective
inhibitor
,
PD098059
,
blocked
cytokine-induced
COX-2
expression
and
PGE2
release
.

Salicylate
treatment
inhibited
COX-2
expression
induced
by
TNF-alpha
/
IFN-gamma
and
regulated
the
activation
of
ERK
,
IKK
and
IkappaB
degradation
and
subsequent
NF-kappaB
activation
in
MC3T3E1
osteoblasts
.

As
well
,
antioxidant-catalase
,
N-acetyl-cysteine
or
reduced
glutathione-attenuated
COX-2
expression
in
combined
cytokines-treated
cells
.

These
antioxidants
also
inhibited
the
activation
of
ERK
,
IKK
and
NF-kappaB
in
MC3T3E1
osteoblasts
.

In
addition
,
TNF-alpha
/
IFN-gamma
stimulated
ROS
release
in
the
osteoblasts
.

However
salicylate
had
no
obvious
effect
on
ROS
release
in
DCFDA
assay
.

The
results
showed
that
salicylate
inhibited
the
activation
of
ERK
and
IKK
,
IkappaB
degradation
and
NF-kappaB
activation
independent
of
ROS
release
and
suggested
that
salicylate
exerts
its
anti-inflammatory
action
in
part
through
inhibition
of
the
ERK
,
IKK
,
IkappaB
,
NF-kappaB
and
resultant
COX-2
expression
pathway
.
Antidepressants
are
generally
used
for
treatment
of
various
mood
and
anxiety
disorders
.

Several
studies
have
shown
the
anti-tumor
and
cytotoxic
activities
of
some
antidepressants
,
but
the
underlying
mechanisms
were
unclear
.

Maprotiline
is
a
tetracyclic
antidepressant
and
possesses
a
highly
selective
norepinephrine
reuptake
ability
.

We
found
that
maprotiline
decreased
cell
viability
in
a
concentration-
and
time-dependent
manner
in
Neuro-2a
cells
.

Maprotiline
induced
apoptosis
and
increased
caspase-3
activation
.

The
activation
of
caspase-3
by
maprotiline
appears
to
depend
on
the
activation
of
JNK
and
the
inactivation
of
ERK
.

Maprotiline
also
induced
[
Ca
(
2
+
)
]
(
i
)
increases
which
involved
the
mobilization
of
intracellular
Ca
(
2
+
)
stored
in
the
endoplasmic
reticulum
.

Pretreatment
with
BAPTA
/
AM
,
a
Ca
(
2
+
)
chelator
,
suppressed
maprotiline-induced
ERK
phosphorylation
,
enhanced
caspase-3
activation
and
increased
maprotiline-induced
apoptosis
.

In
conclusion
,
maprotiline
induced
apoptosis
in
Neuro-2a
cells
through
activation
of
JNK-associated
caspase-3
pathways
.

Maprotiline
also
evoked
an
anti-apoptotic
response
that
was
both
Ca
(
2
+
)
-
and
ERK-dependent
.
This
study
aimed
to
investigate
the
mechanisms
involved
in
the
contractile
effects
produced
by
the
novel
quinoline
derivative
,
2-
(
2-aminoethyl
)
-quinoline
(
D-1997
)
,
in
the
canine
isolated
basilar
artery
.

For
comparison
,
the
effects
of
D-1997
were
also
evaluated
on
rat
aorta
.

Canine
basilar
artery
and
rat
aortic
rings
were
prepared
and
mounted
in
organ
baths
to
record
isometric
tension
changes
.

The
contractile
effects
of
D-1997
in
the
basilar
artery
were
compared
with
those
produced
by
5-hydroxytryptamine
(
5-HT
)
and
the
5-HT
receptor
agonist
quipazine
.

Thus
,
4-HT
(
10
(
-10
)
-10
(
-6
)
M
)
,
D-1997
(
3
.
1

)
-10
(

M
)
and
quipazine
(
3
.
1
x
10
(
-7
)
-10
(
-4
)
M
)
each
caused
concentration-dependent
contractions
of
the
canine
basilar
artery
with
a
rank
order
of
agonist
potency
of
5-HT
>
D-1997
>
quipazine
.

5-HT
and
D-1997
exhibited
similar
maximum
effects
which
were
higher
than
that
of
quipazine
.

Similar
concentrations
of
D-1997
failed
to
produce
contraction
in
rat
aorta
.

The
effects
of
D-1997
in
the
basilar
artery
were
not
modified
by
incubation
with
either
the
5-HT2
receptor

Long-chain

are
general
anesthetics
which
can
also
act
as
uncharged
noncompetitive
inhibitors
of
the
peripheral
nicotinic
acetylcholine
receptor
(
AChR
)
by
binding
to
one
or

on

.

Cembranoids
are
naturally

,
uncharged
noncompetitive
inhibitors
of

AChRs
,
which
have
no

In
this
study
,
[

tenocyclidine
(
[

]
TCP
)
,
an
analogue
of
the
cationic
noncompetitive
inhibitor
phencyclidine
(
PCP
)
,
was
used
to
characterize
the
cembranoid
and
long-chain
alkanol
sites
on
the
desensitized
Torpedo

AChR
and
to
investigate
if
these
sites
interact
.

These
studies
confirm
that
there
is
a
single
cembranoid
site
which
sterically
overlaps
the
[
3H

channel
site
.

This
cembranoid
site
probably
also
overlaps
the
sites
for
the
cationic
noncompetitive

,
procaine

quinacrine
.

Evidence
is
also
presented
for
one
or
more
allosteric
cembranoid
sites
which
negatively
modulate
cembranoid
affinity
for
the
inhibitory
site
.

In
contrast
,
long-chain
alkanols
inhibit
[

TCP
binding
through
an
allosteric
mechanism
involving
two
or
more
alkanol
sites
which
display
positive
cooperativity
toward
each
other
.

Double
inhibitor
studies
show
that
the
cembranoid
inhibitory
site

are
not
independent
of

Colorectal

is
the

cancer
mortality

Substantial
human
and
animal
data
support
the
ability
of
nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory
drugs
to
cause
regression
of
existing
colon
tumors
and
prevent
new
tumor
formation
.

The
mechanism
by
which
the
nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory
drug
sulindac
prevents
tumor
growth
is
poorly
understood
and
seems
complex
as
sulindac
can
modulate
several
growth-related
signaling
pathways
.

Sulindac
metabolites
simultaneously
(
a
)
increase
cellular
cyclic
GMP
and
subsequently
activate
cyclic
GMP-dependent
protein
kinase
(
PKG
)
;
(

)
activate
c-jun
NH2-terminal
kinase
(
JNK
)
;
(

)
inhibit
extracellular

ERK1
/
2
)
;
and
(
d
)
decrease
beta-catenin
protein
expression
at
times
and
doses
consistent
with
apoptosis
.

The
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
determine
if
PKG
,
ERK1
/
2
,
JNK
,
and
beta-catenin
are
independent
targets
for
sulindac
in
vitro
.

Pharmacologic
activation
of
PKG
with
YC-1
increases
JNK
phosphorylation
and
induces
apoptosis
in
colon
cancer
cells
without
modulating
ERK1
/
2
phosphorylation
or
beta-catenin
protein
expression
.

Inhibition
of
ERK1
/
2
with
U0126
induces
apoptosis
but
fails
to
activate
JNK
phosphorylation
or
down-regulate
beta-catenin
protein
expression
.

Cotreatment
with
U0126
and
YC-1
synergistically
increases
apoptosis
in
colorectal
cancer
cells
and
recapitulates
the
effects
of
sulindac
treatment
on
ERK1
/
2
,
JNK
,
and
beta-catenin
.

These
results
indicate
that
sulindac
metabolites
modulate
ERK1
/
2
and
PKG
pathways
independently
in
colon
cancer
cells
and
suggest
that
the
full
apoptotic
effect
of
sulindac
is
mediated
by
more
than
one
pathway
.

Using
similar
combinatorial
approaches
in
vivo
may
provide
more
effective
,
less
toxic
chemopreventive
and
chemotherapeutic
strategies
.

Such
therapies
could
dramatically

BACKGROUND
AND
PURPOSE
:
Adenosine
is
a
major
endogenous
regulator
of
macrophage
function
,
and
activates
four
specific
adenosine
receptors
(
A
(
1
)
,
A
(
2A
)
,
A
(
2B
)
and
A
(
3
)
)
.

Here
,
we
have
assessed
in
human
lung
macrophages
the
modulation
of
the
expression
of
adenosine
receptor
mRNA
by
lipopolysaccharide
(
LPS
)
,
and
the
relative
contributions
of
the
different
adenosine
receptors
to
LPS-induced
production
of
tumour
necrosis
factor
(
TNF
)
-alpha
and
chemokines
.

EXPERIMENTAL
APPROACH
:
Lung
macrophages
isolated
from
resected
lungs
were
stimulated
with
LPS
and
treated
with
adenosine
receptor
agonists
or
/
and
antagonists
.

Adenosine
receptor
expression
was
assessed
with
qRT-PCR
.

Cytokines
were
measured
in
lung
macrophage
supernatants
with
elisa
.

KEY
RESULTS
:
LPS
increased
(
about
400-fold
)
mRNA
for
A
(
2A
)
adenosine
receptors
,
decreased
mRNA
for
A
(
1
)
and
A
(
2B
)
,
but
had
no
effect
on
A
(
3
)
adenosine
receptor
mRNA
.

The
adenosine
receptor
agonist
NECA
inhibited
TNF-alpha
production
concentration
dependently
,
whereas
the
A
(
1
)
receptor
agonist
,
CCPA
,
and
the
A
(
3
)
receptor
agonist
,
AB-MECA
,
inhibited
TNF-alpha
production
only
at
concentrations
affecting
A
(
2A
)
receptors
.

NECA
also
inhibited
the
production
of
CCL
chemokines
(
CCL2
,
CCL3
,
CCL4
,
CCL5
)
and
CXCL
chemokines
(
CXCL9
and
CXCL10
)
,
but
not
that
of
CXCL1
,
CXCL8
and
CXCL5
.

Reversal

TNF-alpha
and

,
but
not
the
A
(

receptor
antagonist
,
MRS

,
or
the
A
(
3
)
receptor
antagonist
,
MRS

,
indicated
involvement
of

of
soybean
trypsin

(
SBTI;
100
units

pretreated
skin
)
for
12h
were
characterised
.

In
general
,
the
addition
of
SBTI
resulted
in
the
lower
yield
,
regardless
of
extraction
temperature
.

Higher
yield
was
obtained
when
higher
extraction
temperature
was
used
(
P<0

)
.

Gelatin
from
skin
extracted
at
75°C
in
the

of
SBTI
showed
the
highest
yield
(
10
.
66
±

.
41%
)
(
based
on

weight
)
.

The
highest
α-amino
group
content
was
observed
in
gelatin
extracted
at
55°C
without
SBTI
incorporated
.

The
band
intensity
of
β-chain
and
α-chains
increased
as
the
extraction
temperature
increased
,
particularly
above
55°C
.

Gelatin
extracted
at
65°C
with
and
without
SBTI
incorporation
exhibited
the
highest
gel
strength
(
178

50
g
and
170
.
47
±

,
respectively
)
.

FTIR
spectra
indicated
that
a
greater
loss
of

order
of
triple
helix
with
a
higher
degradation
was
found
in
gelatin
extracted
at
55°C
in
the

.

Gelatin
extracted
at
65°C
,
either
with
or
without
SBTI
,
had
the
highest
EAI
and
ESI
with
high
foam
expansion
and
stability
.

Thus
,
the
extraction
of
gelatin
from
the
skin
of
unicorn
leatherjacket
at
temperature
sufficiently
high
could
render
the
gelatin
with
less
degradation

was
investigated
.

Male
obese
Sprague-Dawley
(
SD
)
rats
induced
by
high-fat
diet
for
8weeks
period
were
fed
high-fat
,
high-fat
with
GMP
of
100mg

BW
(
HFLG
)
,
200mg
/
kg
BW
(
HFMG
)
and
400mg
/
kg
BW
(
HFHG
)
for
6weeks
.

Compared
with
the
high-fat
control
(
HFC
)
group
GMP
supplementation
significantly
decreased
adipose
tissue
weight
,
activity
of
fatty
acid
synthase
(
FAS
)
and
glycerol-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase
(
GPDH
)
.

Hepatic
lipid
droplet
size
,
plasma
and
hepatic
lipid
levels
markedly
reduced
.

Moreover
,
GMP
reduces
plasma
total
cholesterol
and
low-density
lipoprotein
(
LDL
)
cholesterol
as
well
as
hepatic-cholesterol
and
triglycerides
.

The
liver
steatosis
observed
in
obese
rats
was
also
prevented
by
GMP
supplement
.

In
addition
,
GMP
significantly
diminished
mitochondrial
and
liver
malondialdehyde
(
MDA
)
production
,
and
obviously
elevated
the
activities
of
mitochondrial
and
hepatic
superoxidase
dismutase
(
SOD
)
and
glutathione
peroxidase
(
GSH-Px
)
.

Leptin
production
and
proinflammatory
cytokines
such
as
TNF-α
and
IL-6
secretion
decreased
.

Taken
together
,
GMP
can
reduce
lipid
accumulation
and
enhance
antioxidant
capability
of
obese
rats
.

It
suggests
that
GMP
can
counteract
high-fat
diet-induced
obesity
,
which
might
make
it
a
potential
ingredient
with
anti-obesity
activity
.

Due
to
its
efficient
and
specific
gene
silencing
ability
,
RNA
interference
has
shown
great
potential
in
the
treatment
of
liver
diseases
.

However
,
achieving
in
vivo
delivery
of
siRNA
to
critical
liver
cells
remains
the
biggest
obstacle
for
this
technique
to
be
a
real
clinic
therapeutic
modality
.

Here
,
we
describe
a
promising
liver
targeting
siRNA
delivery
system
based
on
N-acetylgalactosamine
functionalized
mixed
micellar
nanoparticles
(
Gal-MNP
)
,
which
can
efficiently
deliver
siRNA
to
hepatocytes
and
silence
the
target
gene
expression
after
systemic
administration
.

The
Gal-MNP
were
assembled
in
aqueous
solution
from
mixed
N-acetylgalactosamine
functionalized
poly
(
ethylene
glycol
)
-b-poly
(
ε-caprolactone
)
and
cationic
poly
(
ε-caprolactone
)
-b-poly
(

)
(
PCL-b-PPEEA
)
;
the
properties
of
nanoparticles
,
including
particle
size
,
zeta
potential
and
the
density
of
poly
(
ethylene
glycol
)
could
be
easily
regulated
.

The
hepatocyte-targeting
effect
of
Gal-MNP
was
demonstrated
by
significant
enriching
of
fluorescent
siRNA
in
primary
hepatocytes
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
.

Successful
down-regulation
of
liver-specific
apolipoprotein

expression
was
achieved
in
mouse

at
both
the
transcriptional
and
protein
level
,
following
intravenous
injection
of
Gal-MNP

siapoB
to

.

Systemic
delivery
of
Gal-MNP

siRNA
did
not
induce
the
innate

The
results
of
this

Breast
cancer
is
the
most
common
malignancy
among
women
and
has
an
age-specific
incidence
profile
.

Over
the
last
decade
,
many
studies
have
demonstrated
the
anticancer
activity
of
α-tocopherol
,
the
main
and
most
active
form
of
natural
vitamin
E
.

α-Tocopherol-associated
protein
(
TAP
)
was
found
to
be
one
of
the
major
α-tocopherol
binding
proteins
in
human
serum
and
in
liver
,
brain
,
and
prostate
tissues
.

In
this
study
,
we
found
that
reduced
TAP
expression
was
significantly
correlated
with
Her2
/
neu
receptor
expression
,
breast
cancer
stage
and
nodal
stage
in
paired
normal
and
cancerous
breast
tissue
samples
from
93
patients
using
real-time
PCR
analysis
.

A
cell
viability
assay
showed
that
α-tocopheryl
succinate
(
α-TOS
)
,
a
synthetic
derivative
of
α-tocopherol
,
enhanced
the
cells'
sensitivity
to
doxorubicin
and
resulted
in
a
reduction
in
cell
viability
in
breast
cancers
.

Taken
together
,
these
data
suggest
that
the
use
of
vitamin
E
or
its
analogue
as
a
dietary
supplement
may
be
beneficial
for
the
treatment
of
cancer

Both

,
showed
a
strong

,
and
did
not
exhibit

The
anti-proliferative
effect
was
accompanied
by
a
strong
activation
of
ERK
and
induction
of
the

.

In

there
was
a

and
downregulation
of
cyclin

,
with

These
data
suggest
that
compounds
VA441

along
with
their
role

,
could
have
a

Deregulation
of
the
receptor
tyrosine
kinase
Axl
has
been
implicated
in
the
progression
of
several
human
cancers
.

However
,
the
role
of
Axl
in
prostate
cancer
remains
poorly
understood
,
and
the
therapeutic
efficacy
of
Axl
targeting
remains
untested
.

In
this
report
we
identified
Axl
as
a
new
therapeutic
target
for
prostate
cancer
.

Axl
is
consistently
overexpressed
in
prostate
cancer
cell
lines
and
human
prostate
tumors
.

Interestingly
,
the
blockage
of
Axl
gene
expression
strongly
inhibits
proliferation
,
migration
,
invasion
and
tumor
growth
.

Furthermore
,
inhibition
of
Axl
expression
by
small
interfering
RNA
regulates
a
transcriptional
program
of
genes
involved
in
cell
survival
,
strikingly
all
connected
to
the
nuclear
factor-κB
pathway
.

Additionally
,
blockage
of
Axl
expression
leads
to
inhibition
of
Akt
,
IKKα
and
IκBα
phosphorylation
,
increasing
IκBα
expression
and
stability
.

Furthermore
,
induction
of
Akt
phosphorylation
by
insulin-like
growth
factor
1
in
Axl
knockdown
cells
restores
Akt
activity
and
proliferation
.

Taken
together
,
our
results
establish
an
unambiguous
role
for
Axl
in
prostate
cancer
tumorigenesis
with
implications
for
prostate
cancer
treatment

-Galanthamine
(
GAL

,
an
alkaloid
from
the
flower
,
the
common
snowdrop
(
Galanthus
nivalis
)
,
shows
anticholinesterase
activity
.

This
property
has
made
GAL
the
target
of
research
as
to
its
effectiveness
in
the
treatment
of
Alzheimer's
disease
.

We
have
solved
the
X-ray
crystal
structure
of
GAL
bound
in
the
active
site
of
Torpedo
californica
acetylcholinesterase
(
TcAChE
)
to

A
resolution
.

The
inhibitor
binds
at
the
base
of
the
active
site
gorge
of
TcAChE
,
interacting
with
both
the
choline-binding
site
(
Trp-84
)
and
the
acyl-binding
pocket
(
Phe-288
,
Phe-290
)
.

The
tertiary
amine
group
of
GAL
does
not
interact
closely
with
Trp-84;
rather
,
the
double
bond
of
its
cyclohexene
ring
stacks
against
the
indole
ring
.

The
tertiary
amine
appears
to
make
a
non-conventional
hydrogen
bond
,
via
its
N-methyl
group
,
to
Asp-72
,
near
the
top
of
the
gorge
.

The
hydroxyl
group
of
the
inhibitor
makes
a
strong
hydrogen
bond
(
2
.
7
A
)
with
Glu-199
.

The
relatively
tight
binding
of
GAL
to
TcAChE
appears
to
arise
from
a
number
of
moderate
to
weak
interactions
with
the
protein
,
coupled
to
a
low
entropy
cost
for
binding
due
to
the
rigid
nature
of
the
inhibitor
.
Covalent
modifications
of
histones
are
a
crucial
component
of
epigenetic
events
that
regulate
chromatin
structures
and
gene
function
.

Evidence
exists
that
distinct
lysine
residues
in
histones
are
modified
by
covalent
attachment
of
the
vitamin
biotin
,
catalyzed
by
biotinidase
and
holocarboxylase
synthetase
.

Biotinylation
of
histones
appears
to
be
conserved
across
species
.

The
following
biotinylation
sites
were
identified
using
both
MS
and
enzymatic
biotinylation
of
synthetic
peptides
:
K9
,
K13
,
K125
,
K127
,
and
K129
in
histone
H2A;
K4
,
K9
,
and
K18
in
histone
H3;
and
K8
and
K12
in
histone
H4
.

Evidence
was
provided
that
biotinylated
histone
H4
is
enriched
in
pericentromeric
heterochromatin
,
and
that
biotinylation
of
histone
H4
participates
in
gene
silencing
,
mitotic
condensation
of
chromatin
,
and
the
cellular
response
to
DNA
damage
.

Biotinylation
of
histones
is
a
reversible
process
and
depends
on
the
exogenous
biotin
supply
,
but
the
identities
of
histone
debiotinylases
remain
uncertain
.

We
propose
that
some
effects
of
biotin
deficiency
can
be
attributed
to
abnormal
chromatin
structures
.

We
hypothesized
that
the

At

DNA
damage
is
accepted
as
a
consequence
of
thymidylate
deprivation
induced
by
chemotherapeutic
inhibitors
of
thymidylate
synthase
(
TS
)
,
but
the
types
of
damage
and
signaling
responses
remain
incompletely
understood
.

Thymidylate
deprivation
increases
dUTP
and
uracil
in
DNA
,
which
is
removed
by
base
excision
repair
(
BER
)
.

Because
BER
requires
a
synthesis
step
,
strand
break
intermediates
presumably
accumulate
.

Thymidylate
deprivation
also
induces
cell
cycle
arrest
during
replication
.

Homologous
recombination
(
HR
)
is
a
means
of
repairing
persistent
BER
intermediates
and
collapsed
replication
forks
.

There
are
also
intimate
links
between
HR
and
S-phase
checkpoint
pathways
.

In
this
study
,
the
goals
were
to
determine
the
involvement
of
HR-associated
proteins
and
DNA
damage
signaling
responses
to
thymidylate
deprivation
.

HR
,
was

by

To

this

and

.

Induction
was
much
more
striking
following

treatment
than
with

RTX

also
induced

,

,
and
phospho-NBS1
,
although
the
extent
of
co-localization
with

varied
.

Collectively
,
the
results
suggest
that
HR

processes
are
invoked
by
thymidylate

and
influence
cellular
resistance
to

Here
,
we

that

to

is
dose-dependently
enhanced
by

open
when

opened

a
physiological

(

with

Importantly
,
ET-3
was
expressed
in
the
subfornical

(
SFO
)
along
with
Nax
,
and
the
level
was
robustly
increased
by
dehydration
.

Pharmacological
experiments
revealed
that
endothelin

signaling
is
involved
in
this
modulation
of
Nax
gating
through

,
and
a

suggesting
that

Nicotinate

in

was
significantly
inhibited

acid
with
a
relatively
low

(

.

On
the
other
hand
,
the
uptake
process
of

was
also
saturable
with
a
high-affinity
component
(

,
MCT2

Slc16a7
,
and

were
expressed
in
these
cells
.

Because
l-lactate
reduced
to
67%
of
the
nicotinate
uptake
even
at
10mM
,
it
is
unlikely
that
nicotinate

mediated
by

The
major
classes

,
such

,
increase
serum

thus
PCSK9

would
increase
the

Therefore
,
PCSK9
is
an

In

report
15
day-old

(

/
kg
body
weight
and
parameters
of
neurodegeneration
were
analyzed
in
slices
from
cerebellum
3
and
6
days
afterwards
.

The
earlier
responses
,
at
day
3
after
injection
,
included
hyperphosphorylation
of
intermediate
filament
(
IF
)
proteins
from
astrocyte
(
glial

acidic
protein
-
GFAP
-
and

)
and

(

subunits
:
NF-L
,
NF-M
and

)
;
increased

kinase
(
MAPK
)
(
Erk
and
p38MAPK
)
and
cAMP-dependent

.

Also
,
reactive
astrogliosis
takes
part
of
the
early
responses
to
the
insult
with
(
PhTe
)
(
2
)
,
evidenced
by
upregulated
GFAP
in
Western

,
PCR
and
immunofluorescence
analysis
.

Six
days
after
(
PhTe
)
(

)
injection
we
found
persistent
astrogliosis
,
increased
propidium
iodide
(
PI
)
positive
cells
in
NeuN
positive
population
evidenced
by
flow

and
reduced
immunofluorescence
for
NeuN
,
suggesting
that
the
in
vivo
exposure
to
(
PhTe
)
(
2
)
progressed
to
neuronal
death
.

Moreover
,
activated
caspase
3
suggested
apoptotic
neuronal
death
.

Neurodegeneration
was
related
with
decreased
[
(
3
)
H
]
glutamate
uptake
and
decreased
Akt
immunoreactivity
,
however
phospho-GSK-3-β
(
Ser9
)
was
not
altered
in
(
PhTe
)
(
2
)
injected
rat
.

Therefore
,
the
present
results
show
that
the
earlier
cerebellar
responses
to
(
PhTe
)
(
2
)
include
disruption
of
cytoskeletal
homeostasis
that
could
be
related
with
MAPK
and
PKA
activation
and
reactive
astrogliosis
.

Akt
inhibition
observed
at
this
time
could
also
play
a
role
in
the
neuronal
death
evidenced
afterwards
.

The
later
events
of
the
neurodegenerative
process
are
characterized
by
persistent
astrogliosis
and
activation
of
apoptotic
neuronal
death
through
caspase
3
mediated
mechanisms
,
which
could
be
related
with
glutamate
excitotoxicity
.

The
progression
of
these
responses
are
therefore
likely
to
be
critical
for
the
outcome
of
the
neurodegeneration
provoked
by
(
PhTe

in

In
this

,
we
specifically
depleted
Smad4
in

using
Cyp19-Cre
mice
.

As
different
from
results
with
Smad4
(
fl
/
fl
)
;Amhr2-Cre
mice
,
Smad4
depletion
in
preovulatory
follicles
did
not
cause
premature
luteinization
or
suppress
GC
proliferation;
rather
,
it
increased
follicle
atresia
.

In
addition
,
Nppc
and
Npr2
expressions
were
reduced
by
Smad4
depletion;
thus
,
their
effect
of
maintaining
oocyte
meiotic
arrest
was
weakened
in
Smad4
conditional
knockout
mice
.

Smad4
(
fl
/
fl
)
;Cyp19-Cre
female
mice
were
subfertile
and
had
irregular
estrous
cycles
and
ovulation
defects
.

Smad4
knockout
also
blocked
luteinizing
hormone
(
LH
)
-induced
cumulus
expansion
and
follicle
rupture
,
but
not
oocyte
meiotic
resumption
.

Our
results
also
indicated
that
SMAD4
was
required
for
LH-stimulated
activation
of
ERK1
/
2
and
the
expressions
of
ovulation-related
genes
.

The
defects
arising
from
SMAD4
depletion
could
not
be
rescued
by
intra-ovarian
mediators
of
LH
actions
,
such
as
EGF-like
factors
and
prostaglandin
E2
.

Furthermore
,
corpus
lutea
did
not
form
in
Smad4
(
fl
/
fl
)
;Cyp19-Cre
female
mice
,
indicating
that
SMAD4
was
crucial
for
GCs
terminal
differentiation
.

Thus
,
by
characterizing
the
ovarian
phenotypes
of
preovulatory
follicle-specific
Smad4
knockout
mice
,
we
identified
the
developmental
stage-specific
functions
of
the
canonical
TGF-β
signaling
pathway
in
ovulation
and
luteinization
.

the
results
were
compared
with
those
obtained
with
prazosin
,
amosulalol
,
labetalol
,

,

and

.

The
pKi
value
of
tamsulosin
to
the
alpha
(

-subtype
was
lower
than
those
of
prazosin
and
HV-723
,
but
higher
than
those
of
amosulalol
,
ketanserin
and
labetalol
.

The
pKi
value
of
tamsulosin
for
the
alpha
(
1B
)
-subtype
in
the
canine
aorta
was
similar
to
that
of
prazosin
.

However
,
this
drug
showed
a
higher
pKi
value
than
amosulalol
,
HV-723
,
labetalol
and
ketanserin
.

On
the
other
hand
,
the
order
of
inhibition
potencies
for
contraction
of
the
rat
aorta
by
phenylephrine
was
as
follows
:
prazosin
>
tamsulosin
>
amosulalol
>
HV-723
>
labetalol
>
ketanserin
>
clonidine
>
propranolol
.

Thus
,
although
the
affinity
of
tamsulosin
to
the
alpha
(
1B
)
-AR
subtype
in
the
canine
aorta
was
as
high
as
that
in
the
bovine
prostate
reported
in
our
previous
study
,
the
affinity
(
pKi
7
.

87
)
of
this
drug
to
alpha
(
1L

-AR
in
the
canine
aorta
was
lower
than
that
(
pKi

.
99
)
in
the
bovine
prostate
.

These
observations
suggested
that
the
pharmacological
potencies
of

in
the
aorta
and
prostate
may
be
different

The
objective
of
this

was
to
identify
the
role
of
Nrf2
in
the
regulation
of
ACD
.

We
used
the
Local

(

)
and
the

to
study
the

in
both
the

and

.

Five
chemicals
were
used
:
two
compounds
known
to
react
with
cysteine
residues
,
2
,
4-dinitrochlorobenzene
(
DNCB
)
and
cinnamaldehyde
(

;
one
sensitizer
known
to
exhibit
mixed
reactivity
to
cysteine

,
isophorone

(
IPDI
)
;
and
one
reacting
specifically
with
lysine
residues
,
trimellitic
anhydride
(
TMA
)
and
croton
oil
a
well-known
irritant
.

In
the
MEST
assay
,
DNCB
(
1%
and
2%
)
induced
a
significant
increase
in
ear
thickness
in
nrf2
(
-
/

)
as
compared
to
nrf2
(
+
/

)
mice
suggesting
a
role
for
Nrf2
in
the
control
of
the
inflammatory
process
.

When
DNCB
was
used
at
0
.
25%
and
0
.
5%
or
when
mice
were
treated
with
CinA
,
inflammation
was
found
only
in
nrf2
(

mice
.

In
the
LLNA
all
chemical
sensitizers
induced
an
increase
of

)
compared
to
nrf2
(

mice
for
the
same
chemical
concentration
.

These
results
reveal
an
important
role
for
Nrf2
in
controlling
ACD
and
lymphocyte
proliferation
in
response
to
sensitizers
.
Factor
IXR94S
is
a
naturally

hemophilia
B
defect
,
which
results
from
an
Arg
94
to
Ser
mutation
in
the
second
epidermal
growth
factor
(
EGF
)
-like
module
of
factor
IX
.

Recombinant
factor
IXR94S
was
activated
by
factor
XIa
/
calcium
with
an
approximately
50-fold
reduced
rate
and
by
factor
VIIa
/
tissue
factor
/
phospholipid
/
calcium
with
an
approximately
20-fold
reduced
rate
compared
with
wild-type
factor
IX
.

The
apparent
molecular
mass
of
the
light
chain
of
factor
IXaR94S
was
approximately
6
kD
higher
than
that
of
plasma
or
wild-type
factor
IX
,
which
was
not
corrected
by
N-glycosidase
F
digestion
.

This
result
indicated
the
presence
of
additional
O-linked
carbohydrate
in
the
mutant
light
chain
,
probably
at
new
Ser
94
.

The
initial
rate
of
activation
of
factor
X
by
factor
IXaR94S
in
the
presence
of
polylysine
was
7%
+
/
-
1%
of
the
initial
rate
of
activation
of
factor
X
by
plasma
factor
IXa
,
and
the
kc
/
Km
for
activation
of
factor
X
by
factor
IXaR94S
/
factor
VIIIa
/
phospholipid

was
4%

1%
of
the
kc

Km
for
activation
of
factor
X
by
plasma
factor
IXa
/

.

The
reduced
efficiency
of
activation
of
factor
X
by
factor
IXaR94S
in
the
tenase

complex
was
due
to
a
58-fold
+
/
-
12-fold
decrease
in
kcat
with
little
effect
on
Km
.

In
conclusion
,
the
R94S
mutation
had
introduced
an
O-linked
carbohydrate
,
which
markedly
impaired
both
activation
by
factor
XIa
and
turnover
of

in
the
tenase

Fluctuating
Parkinson's
disease
(
PD
)
represents
a
clinical
management
challenge
.

The
primary
utility
of
levodopa
in
patients
with
PD
is
moderated
by
the
"wearing
off"
phenomena
seen
with
long-term
use
.

COMT
inhibitors
slow
down
the
rapid
metabolism
of
levodopa
,
resulting
in
a
more-sustained
response
to
dopaminergic
therapy
.

Tolcapone
is
a
selective
,
reversible
catechol-O-methyltransferase
(
COMT
)
inhibitor
,
shown
to
have
both
peripheral
and
central
effects
.

In
clinical
trials
,
tolcapone
has
been
shown
to
reduce
"off"
time
,
increase
"on"
time
,
improve
patient
and
clinician
assessments
of
disease
severity
,
and
improve
patient
quality
of
life
.

In
a
SWITCH
study
,
tolcapone
was
associated
with
greater
duration
of
"on"
time
than
remaining
on
entacapone
.

Adverse
effects
of
tolcapone
are
related
to
the
class
,
with
the
exception
of
rare
cases
of
hepatotoxicity
.

Tolcapone
has
been
recently
reintroduced
on
the
European
market
and
recent
guidance
from
the
US
Food
and
Drug
Administration
has
reduced
the
hepatic
monitoring
requirements
for
patients
initiating
tolcapone
therapy
.

With
proper
monitoring
,
tolcapone
is
an
effective
,
well-tolerated
drug
useful
in
the
management
of
patients
with
fluctuating
PD
.
Caffeine
exposure
sensitizes
tumor
cells
to
ionizing
radiation
and
other
genotoxic
agents
.

The
radiosensitizing
effects
of
caffeine
are
associated
with
the
disruption
of
multiple
DNA
damage-responsive
cell
cycle
checkpoints
.

The
similarity
of
these
checkpoint
defects
to
those
seen
in
ataxia-telangiectasia
(
A-T
)
suggested
that
caffeine
might
inhibit
one
or
more
components
in
an
A-T
mutated
(
ATM
)
-dependent
checkpoint
pathway
in
DNA-damaged
cells
.

We
now
show
that
caffeine
inhibits
the
catalytic
activity
of
both
ATM
and
the
related
kinase
,
ATM
and
Rad3-related
(
ATR
)
,
at
drug
concentrations
similar
to
those
that
induce
radiosensitization
.

Moreover
,
like
ATM-deficient
cells
,
caffeine-treated
A549
lung
carcinoma
cells
irradiated
in
G2
fail
to
arrest
progression
into
mitosis
,
and
S-phase-irradiated
cells
exhibit
radioresistant
DNA
synthesis
.

Similar
concentrations
of
caffeine
also
inhibit
gamma-
and
UV
radiation-induced
phosphorylation
of
p53
on
Ser15
,
a
modification
that
may
be
directly
mediated
by
the
ATM
and
ATR
kinases
.

DNA-dependent
protein
kinase
,
another
ATM-related
protein
involved
in
DNA
damage
repair
,
was
resistant
to
the
inhibitory
effects
of
caffeine
.

Likewise
,
the
catalytic
activity
of
the
G2
checkpoint
kinase
,
hChk1
,
was
only
marginally
suppressed
by
caffeine
but
was
inhibited
potently
by
the
structurally
distinct
radiosensitizer
,
UCN-01
.

These
data
suggest
that
the
radiosensitizing
effects
of
caffeine
are
related
to
inhibition
of
the
protein
kinase
activities
of
ATM
and
ATR
and
that
both
proteins
are
relevant
targets
for
the
development
of
novel
anticancer
agents
.
Histamine
H
(
1
)
blockade
is
one
of
the
more
prominent
actions
of
the
multi-receptor
acting
antipsychotic
clozapine
.

It
is
currently
not
known
how
much
this
H
(
1
)
antagonism
of
clozapine
contributes
to
the
therapeutic
or
adverse
side
effects
of
clozapine
.

The
current
studies
with
Sprague-Dawley
rats
were
conducted
to
determine
the
participation
of
histaminergic
H
(
1
)
receptor
subtype
in
sensorimotor
plasticity
and
memory
function
affected
by
clozapine
using
tests
of
prepulse
inhibition
(
PPI
)
and
radial-arm
maze
choice
accuracy
.

The
PPI
impairment
caused
by
the
glutamate
antagonist
dizocilpine
(
MK-801
)
was
significantly
attenuated
by
clozapine
.

In
the
current
project
,
we
found
that
the
selective
H
(
1
)
antagonist
pyrilamine
also
reversed
the
dizocilpine-induced
impairment
in
PPI
of
tactile
startle
with
an
auditory
prepulse
.

In
the
radial-arm
maze
(
RAM
)
,
pyrilamine
,
like
clozapine
,
impaired
working
memory
and
caused
a
significant
dose-related
slowing
of
response
.

Pyrilamine
,
however
,
decreased
the
number
of
reference
memory
errors
.

We
have
previously
shown
that
nicotine
effectively
attenuates
the
clozapine-induced
working
memory
impairment
,
but
in
the
current
study
,
nicotine
did
not
significantly
alter
the
effects
of
pyrilamine
on
the
RAM
.

In
summary
,
the
therapeutic
effect
of
clozapine
in
reversing
PPI
impairment
was
mimicked
by
the
H
(
1
)
antagonist
pyrilamine
,
while
pyrilamine
had
a
mixed
effect
on
cognition
.

Pyrilamine
impaired
working
memory
but
improved
reference
memory
in
rats
.

Thus
,
H
(
1
)
antagonism
seems
to
play
a
role
in
part
of
the
beneficial
actions
of
antipsychotics
,
such
as
clozapine
.
Trace
amine-associated
receptor
1
(
TAAR1
)
is
a
G
protein-coupled
receptor
that
directly
responds
to
endogenous
monoamines
as
well
as
amphetamine-related
psychostimulants
,
including
methamphetamine
.

In
the
present
study
,
we
demonstrate
TAAR1
mRNA
and
protein
expression
in
rhesus
monkey
brain
regions
associated
with
monoaminergic
systems
,
variable
cellular
distribution
of
TAAR1
in
rhesus
monkey
brain
,
and
TAAR1
coexpression
with
the
dopamine
transporter
(
DAT
)
in
a
subset
of
dopamine
neurons
in
both
rhesus
monkey
and
mouse
substantia
nigra
.

On
this
basis
,
we
evaluated
rhesus
monkey
TAAR1
activation
by
different
compounds
and
its
functional
relation
with
monoamine
transporters
and
the
dopamine
D2
receptor
(
D2
)
short
isoform
(
D2s
)
autoreceptor
in
vitro
using
a
cAMP
response
element-luciferase
assay
.

TAAR1
activation
by
monoamines
and
amphetamine-related
compounds
was
greatly
enhanced
by
coexpression
of
dopamine
,
norepinephrine
,
or
serotonin
transporters
,
and
the
activation
enhancement
was
blocked
by
monoamine
transporter
inhibitors
.

This
enhancement
did
not
occur
in
control
experiments
in
which
the
dopamine
D1
receptor
(
D1
)
was
substituted
for
TAAR1
.

Furthermore
,
activation
of
TAAR1
by
dopamine
was
completely
inhibited
by
D2s
when
coexpressed
with
TAAR1
,
and
this
inhibition
was
blocked
by
the
D2
antagonist
raclopride
.

Last
,
dopamine
activation
of
TAAR1
could
induce
c-FOS-luciferase
expression
but
only
in
the
presence
of
DAT
,
whereas
dopamine
activation
of
D1
resulted
in
equivalent
c-FOS
expression
in
the
presence
or
absence
of
DAT
.

Together
,
these
data
reveal
a
broad
agonist
spectrum
for
TAAR1
,
a
functional
relation
of
TAAR1
with
monoamine
transporters
and
D2s
,
and
a
mechanism
by
which
D2
receptor
drugs
can
influence
brain
monoaminergic
function
and
have
efficacy
through
affecting
TAAR1
signaling

plays
a

We

of

,
induces

which
results
in

mimicking
that
seen
in
RXRalphabeta
(
ep-

mutants
and

overexpressing
TSLP
in

.

Furthermore
,
topical
application
of

also
induces
TSLP

S100A4

family
of
Ca
(

)
-binding
proteins
,
regulates
carcinoma
cell
motility
via
interactions
with
myosin-IIA
.

Numerous
studies
indicate
that
S100A4
is
not
simply
a
marker
for
metastatic
disease
,
but
rather
has
a
direct
role
in
metastatic
progression
.

These
observations
suggest
that
S100A4
is
an
excellent
target
for
therapeutic
intervention
.

Using
a
unique
biosensor-based
assay
,
trifluoperazine
(
TFP
)
was
identified
as
an
inhibitor
that
disrupts
the
S100A4
/
myosin-IIA
interaction
.

To
examine
the
interaction
of
S100A4
with
TFP
,
we
determined
the

.

A
crystal
structure
of
human
Ca
(

-S100A4
bound
to
TFP
.

Two
TFP
molecules
bind
within
the
hydrophobic
target
binding
pocket
of
Ca
(
2

)
-S100A4
with
no
significant
conformational
changes
observed
in
the
protein
upon
complex
formation
.

NMR
chemical
shift
perturbations
are
consistent
with
the
crystal
structure
and
demonstrate
that
TFP
binds
to
the
target
binding
cleft
of
S100A4
in
solution
.

Remarkably
,
TFP
binding
results
in
the
assembly
of
five
Ca
(
2
+
)
-S100A4
/
TFP
dimers
into
a
tightly
packed
pentameric
ring
.

Within
each
pentamer
most
of
the
contacts
between
S100A4
dimers
occurs
through
the
TFP
moieties
.

The
Ca
(
2
+
)
-S100A4
/
prochlorperazine
(
PCP
)
complex
exhibits
a
similar
pentameric
assembly
.

Equilibrium
sedimentation
and
cross-linking
studies
demonstrate
the
cooperative
formation
of
a
similarly
sized
S100A4
/
TFP
oligomer
in
solution
.

Assays
examining
the
ability
of
TFP
to
block
S100A4-mediated
disassembly
of
myosin-IIA
filaments
demonstrate
that
significant
inhibition
of
S100A4
function
occurs
only
at
TFP
concentrations
that
promote
S100A4
oligomerization
.

Together
these
studies
support
a
unique
mode
of
inhibition
in
which
phenothiazines
disrupt
the
S100A4
/
myosin-IIA
interaction
by
sequestering
S100A4

was
ruled
out
as
a
primary
mechanism
[

.

This
study
compared
in
vitro
binding
affinities
and
functional
activities
of
olanzapine
,
clozapine
,
thioridazine
,
ziprasidone
,
risperidone
,
chlorpromazine
and
scopolamine
at
muscarinic
M2
receptors
with
their
in
vivo
potencies
to
increase
acetylcholine
release
in
the
rat
hippocampus
.

We
found
that
scopolamine
,
olanzapine
and
clozapine
,
but
also
high
doses
of
thioridazine
and
chlorpromazine
,
markedly
increase
acetylcholine
release
.

The
reduced
in
vivo
potencies
of
thioridazine
and
chlorpromazine
are
consistent
with
their
significantly
weaker
functional
antagonist
activity
at
human
muscarinic
M2
receptors
,
while
thioridazine's
reduced
binding
affinity
for
rat
muscarinic
M2
receptors
and
lower
brain
exposure
,
may
further
contribute
to
its
weak
in
vivo
potency
compared
to
olanzapine
.

The
excellent
correlation
between
in
vitro
antagonist
activities
of
antipsychotics
at
muscarinic
M2
receptors
and
their
in
vivo
potencies
to
increase
acetylcholine
release
,
suggests
that
olanzapine
,
clozapine
,
as
well
as
thioridazine
and
chlorpromazine
,
increase
acetylcholine
release
via
blockade
of
terminal
muscarinic
M2
autoreceptors
.
In
the
present
study
,
we
prepared
an
inclusion
complex
of
methotrexate
(
MTX
)
with
β-cyclodextrin
(
β-CD
)
in
order
to
decrease
its
photosensitivity
and
enhance
its
aqueous
solubility
.

Then
we
incorporated
this
inclusion
complex
in
a
self-microemulsifying
drug
delivery
system
(
SMEDDS
)
overall
to
increase
its
oral
bioavailability
.

The
inclusion
complex
has
been
prepared
by
freeze
drying
method
and
characterized
by
differential
scanning
calorimetry
(
DSC
)
,
ultraviolet
(
UV
)
,
and
infrared
(
IR
)
spectroscopy
assays
.

The
proper
molecular
ratio
of
MTX
/
β-CD
was
found
to
be
of
1
:
7
,
and
the
water-solubility
of
MTX
was
increased
in
an
average
of
10-fold
.

The
photostability
studies
showed
that
the
MTX
became
stable
on
exposure
to
light
.

Construction
of
pseudoternary
diagrams
were
investigated
to
prepare
a
MTX
/
β-CD
inclusion
complex
loaded
SMEDDS
which
was
characterized
by
measuring
the
particle
size
and
the
zeta-potential
.

The
optimum
formulation
of
SMEDDS
was
a
system
consisting
of
ethyl
oleate
,
tween
80
,
and
propylene
glycol
with
a
mean
droplet
size
of
39
.
42
nm
.

In
vitro
drug
release
in
different
pH
media
showed
that
the
release
profile
of
MTX
from
the
MTX
/
β-CD
loaded
SMEDDS
was
influenced
by
the
pH
of
the
release
medium
and
presented
the
characteristics
of
a
sustained
release
profile
.

Finally
,
in-vivo
studies
showed
an
enhancement
of
the
bioavailability
of
MTX
from
the
MTX
/
β-CD
loaded
SMEDDS
form
of
1
.
57-fold
.

We
concluded
that
the
β-CD
inclusion
complex
loaded
SMEDDS
improved
the
chemical
and
physiological
properties
of
MTX
and
could
be
a
promising
means
for
the
delivery
of
MTX
and
other
unstable
and
lipophilic
drugs
by
oral
route
.

impairments
.

Given
the
well-known
beneficial
effects
of
voluntary
exercise
on
cognitive
functions
,
we
examined
whether
voluntary
exercise
would
improve
the
cognitive
deficits
induced
by
chronic
administration
of
ND
.

We
also
investigated
the
effects
of
ND
and
voluntary
exercise
on
hippocampal
BDNF
levels
.

The
rats
were
randomly
distributed
into
4
experimental
groups
:
the
vehicle-sedentary
group
,
the
ND-sedentary
group
,
the
vehicle-exercise
group
,
and
the
ND-exercise
group
.

The
vehicle-exercise
and
the
ND-exercise
groups
were
allowed
to
freely
exercise
in
a
running
wheel
for
15
days
.

The
vehicle-sedentary
and
the
ND-sedentary
groups
were
kept
sedentary
for
the
same
period
.

Vehicle
or
ND
injections
were
started
14
days
prior
to
the
voluntary
exercise
and
continued
throughout
the
15
days
of
voluntary
exercise
.

After
the
15-day
period
,
the
rats
were
trained
and
tested
on
a
water
maze
spatial
task
using
four
trials
per
day
for
5
consecutive
days
followed
by
a
probe
trial
two
days
later
.

Exercise
significantly
improved
performance
during
both
the
training
and
retention
of
the
water
maze
task
,
and
enhanced
hippocampal
BDNF
.

ND
impaired
spatial
learning
and
memory
,
and
this
effect
was
not
rescued
by
exercise
.

ND
also
potentiated
the
exercise-induced
increase
in
hippocampal
BDNF
levels
.

These
results
seem
to
indicate
that
voluntary
exercise
is
unable
to
improve
the
disruption
of
cognitive
functions
by
chronic
ND
.

Moreover
,
increased
levels
of
BDNF
may
play
a
role
in
ND-induced
impairments
in
learning
and
memory
.

The
harmful
effects
of
ND
and
other
AAS
on
learning
and
memory
should
be
taken
into
account
when
athletes
decide
to

The
decrease
in
glomerular
filtration
rate
(
GFR
)
that
is
characteristic
of
sepsis
has
been
shown
to
result
from
inhibition
of
glomerular
endothelial
nitric
oxide
synthase
(
eNOS
)
by
nitric
oxide
(
NO
)
generated
from
the

(

)

Although
l-arginine
is
the
sole
precursor
for
NO
biosynthesis
,
its
intracellular
availability
in
glomeruli
from
septic
animals
has
never
been
investigated
.

Arginine
uptake
was
measured
in

glomeruli
from
the

experimental
groups
:

)
,

,
or

,
a

antagonist;
and
4
)
rats
treated
with
l-NIL
only
.

Both
glomeular
and
mesangial
arginine
transport
characteristics
were
found
compatible
with
a
y
(
+
)
system
.

Arginine
uptake
was
augmented
in
glomeruli
from
LPS-treated
rats
.

Treatment
with
l-NIL
completely
abolished
this
effect
whereas
l-NIL
alone
had
no
effect
.

Similar
results
were
obtained
when
primary
cultures
of
rat
mesangial
cells
were
preincubated
with
LPS
(
10
microg
/
ml
for
24
h
)
with
or
without
l-NIL
.

Using
RT-PCR
,
we
found
that
in
vivo
administration
of
LPS
resulted
in
a
significant
increase
in
glomerular
cationic
amino
acid
transporter-2
(
CAT-2
)
mRNA
expression
whereas
CAT-1
mRNA
was
undetected
.

Northern
blotting
further
confirmed
a
significant
increase
in
glomerular
CAT-2
by
LPS
.

In
mesangial
cells
,
the
expression
of
both
CAT-1
and
CAT-2
mRNA
was
augmented
after
incubation
with
LPS
.

In
conclusion
,
in
vivo
administration
of
LPS
augments
glomerular
arginine
transport
through
upregulation
of
steady-state
CAT-2
mRNA
while
downregulating
CAT-1
mRNA
.

These
results
may
correspond
to
the
changes
in
glomerular
iNOS
and
eNOS
activity
in
sepsis
.
Nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory
drugs
(
NSAIDs
)
including
sulindac
have
shown
potent
chemopreventive
and
tumor
regressive
effects
against
colorectal
cancer
,
the
second
leading
cause
of
cancer

in
the
United
States
.

However
,
the
mechanisms
by
which
sulindac
inhibits
tumor
cell
growth
are
not
completely
understood
.

We
previously
reported
that
sulindac
metabolites
inhibit
the
mitogen-activated
protein
/
extracellular
signal-regulated
kinase
kinase
/
extracellular
signal-regulated
kinase
(
MEK
/

)
signaling
cascade
in
colorectal
cancer
cell
lines
at
doses
that
induce
apoptosis
,
and
inhibition
of
MEK
/
ERK
activity
with
U0126
is
sufficient
to
induce
apoptotic
cell
death
.

To
determine
whether
inhibition
of
MEK
/
ERK
activity
is
necessary
for
sulindac-induced
apoptosis
of
human
colon
cancer
cells
,
stable
transfectants
were
created
that
express
an
activated
MEK1
gene
in
HT29
cells
.

HT29-MEK1
(
R4F
)
clones
displayed
a
10-
to
20-fold
increase
in
MEK1
activity
compared
with
control
HT29-pCEP4
clones
.

When
compared
with
control
HT29-pCEP4
clones
,
HT29-MEK1
(
R4F
)
clones
were
resistant
to
both
apoptosis
and
inhibition
of
ERK1
/
2
phosphorylation
induced
by
sulindac
metabolites
.

These
results
suggest
that
inhibition
of
MEK

signaling
is
necessary
for
the
induction
of
apoptosis
by
sulindac
metabolites
.
Mutations
affecting
the
Sequestosome
1
(
SQSTM1
)
gene
commonly
occur
in
patients
with
the
skeletal
disorder
Paget's
disease
of
bone
(
PDB
)
,
a
condition
characterised
by
defective
osteoclast
differentiation
and
function
.

Whilst
most
mutations
cluster
within
the
ubiquitin-associated
(
UBA
)
domain
of
the
SQSTM1
protein
,
and
are
associated
with
dysregulated
NFκB
signalling
,
several
non-UBA
domain
mutations
have
also
been
identified
.

Keap1
is
a
SQSTM1-interacting
protein
that
regulates
the
levels
and
activity
of
the
Nrf2
transcription
factor
.

This
in
turn
controls
the
expression
of
numerous
cytoprotective
genes
that
contribute
to
the
cell's
capacity
to
defend
itself
against
chemical
and
oxidative
stress
,
through
binding
to
the
antioxidant
response
element
(
ARE
)
.

The
PDB-associated
S349T
mutation
maps
to
the
Keap1-interacting
region
(
KIR
)
of
SQSTM1
,
however
the
effects
of
PDB
mutant
SQSTM1
on
Keap1
function
have
not
been
investigated
.

Here
we
show
that
unlike
other
SQSTM1
mutations
,
the
S349T
mutation
results
in
neither
impaired
ubiquitin-binding
function
in
pull-down
assays
,
nor
dysregulated
NFκB
signalling
in
luciferase
reporter
assays
.

Keap1
is
expressed
in
differentiating
osteoclast-like
cells
and
the
S349T
mutation
selectively
impairs
the
SQSTM1-Keap1
interaction
in
co-immunoprecipitations
,
which
molecular
modelling
indicates
results
from
effects
on
critical
hydrogen
bonds
required
to
stabilise
the
KIR-Keap1
complex
.

Further
,
S349T
mutant
SQSTM1
,
but
not
other
PDB-associated
mutants
,
showed
reduced
ability
to
activate
Nrf2
signalling
as
assessed
by
ARE-luciferase
reporter
assays
.

Thus
,
SQSTM1-mediated
dysregulation
of
the
Keap1-Nrf2
axis
,
which
could
potentially
lead
to
aberrant
production
of
oxidative
response
genes
,
may
contribute
to
disease
aetiology
in
a
subset
of
PDB
patients
.
Formaldehyde
(
FA
)
,
a
major
industrial
chemical
and
ubiquitous
environmental
pollutant
,
has
recently
been
classified
by
the
International
Agency
for
Research
on
Cancer
as
a
human
leukemogen
.

The
major
mode
of
action
of
FA
is
thought
to
be
the
formation
of
DNA-protein
cross-links
(
DPCs
)
.

Repair
of
DPCs
may
be
mediated
by
the
Fanconi
anemia
pathway;
however
,
data
supporting
the
involvement
of
this
pathway
are
limited
,
particularly
in
human
hematopoietic
cells
.

Therefore
,
we
assessed
the
role
of
FANCD2
,
a
critical
component
of
the
Fanconi
anemia
pathway
,
in
FA-induced
toxicity
in
human
lymphoblast
cell
models
of
FANCD2
deficiency
(
PD20
cells
)
and
FANCD2
sufficiency
(
PD20-D2
cells
)
.

After
treatment
of
the
cells
with
0-150
μM
FA
for
24
h
,
DPCs
were
increased
in
a
dose-dependent
manner
in
both
cell
lines
,
with
greater
increases
in
FANCD2-deficient
PD20
cells
.

FA
also
induced
cytotoxicity
,
micronuclei
,
chromosome
aberrations
,
and
apoptosis
in
a
dose-dependent
manner
in
both
cell
lines
,
with
greater
increases
in
cytotoxicity
and
apoptosis
in
PD20
cells
.

Increased
levels
of
γ-ATR
and
γ-H2AX
in
both
cell
lines
suggested
the
recognition
of
FA-induced
DNA
damage;
however
,
the
induction
of
BRCA2
was
compromised
in
FANCD2-deficient
PD20
cells
,
potentially
reducing
the
capacity
to
repair
DPCs
.

Together
,
these
findings
suggest
that
FANCD2
protein
and
the
Fanconi
anemia
pathway
are
essential
to
protect
human
lymphoblastoid
cells
against
FA
toxicity
.

Future
studies
are
needed
to
delineate
the
role
of
this
pathway
in
mitigating
FA-induced
toxicity
,
particularly
in
hematopoietic
stem
cells
,

target

Cresyl
saligenin
phosphate
(
CBDP
)
is
a
suspected
causative
agent
of
"aerotoxic
syndrome"
,
affecting
pilots
,
crew
members
and
passengers
.

CBDP
is
produced
in

from
ortho-containing
isomers
of
tricresyl
phosphate
(
TCP
)
,
a
component
of
jet
engine
lubricants
and
hydraulic
fluids
.

CBDP
irreversibly
inhibits
butyrylcholinesterase
(
BChE
)
in
human
plasma
by
forming
adducts
on
the
active
site
serine
(
Ser-198
)
.

Inhibited
BChE
undergoes
aging
to
release
saligenin
and
o-cresol
.

The
active
site
histidine
(
His-438
)
was
hypothesized
to
abstract
o-hydroxybenzyl
moiety
from
the
initial
adduct
on
Ser-198
.

Our
goal
was
to
test
this
hypothesis
.

Mass
spectral
analysis
of
CBDP-inhibited
BChE
digested
with
Glu-C
showed
an
o-hydroxybenzyl
adduct
(
+
106amu
)
on
lysine
499
,
a
residue
far
from
the
active
site
,
but
not
on
His-438
.

Nevertheless
,
the
nitrogen
of
the
imidazole
ring
of
free
l-histidine
formed
a
variety
of

As
a
part
of
our
ongoing
effort

identify
anti-diabetic
constituents

,
we
examined
the
inhibitory
activity
of
the
methanol
extracts
of
12
species
of
the
genus
Artemisia
,
against
α-glucosidase
and
protein
tyrosine
phosphatase

(
PTP1B
)
.

The
methanol
extracts
of
different
species
exhibited
promising
α-glucosidase
and
PTP1B
inhibitory
activities
.

Since
the
methanol
extract
of
Artemisia
capillaris
exhibited
the
highest
α-glucosidase
inhibitory
activity
together
with
significant
PTP1B
inhibitory
activity
,
it
was
selected
for
further
investigation
.

to
the

.

In
addition
,
esculetin
and
6-methoxy
artemicapin
C
displayed
PTP1B
inhibitory
activity
.

Interestingly
,
all
isolated
dicaffeoylquinic
acids
showed
significant
PTP1B
inhibitory

.

Therefore
,
the
results
of
the
present
study
clearly
demonstrate
the
potential
of
the
A
.

capillaris
extract
to
inhibit
α-glucosidase
and
PTP1B
.

These
inhibitory
properties
can
be
largely
attributed
to
a
combination
of
different
chemical
structures
,
including
coumarins
,
flavonoids
,
and
dicaffeoylquinic
acids
,
which
could
be
further
explored
to
develop
therapeutic
or
preventive
agents
for
the
treatment
of
diabetes

The
specific
impact
of
enhanced
2-arachidonoylglycerol
signaling
on
corticosterone
plasma
levels
,
however
,
was
not
investigated
so
far
.

Here
we
studied
the
effects
of
the
recently
developed
monoacylglycerol
lipase
inhibitor
JZL184
on
basal
and
stress-induced
corticosterone
levels
in
male
CD1
mice
,
and
found
that
this
compound
dramatically
increased
basal
levels
without
affecting
stress
responses
.

Since
acute
changes
in
corticosterone
levels
can
affect
behavior
,
JZL184
was
administered
concurrently
with
the
corticosterone
synthesis
inhibitor
metyrapone
,
to
investigate
whether
the
previously
shown
behavioral
effects
of
JZL184
are
dependent
on
corticosterone
.

We
found
that
in
the
elevated
plus-maze
,
the
effects
of
JZL184
on
"classical"
anxiety-related
measures
were
abolished
by
corticosterone
synthesis
blockade
.

By
contrast
,
effects
on
the
"ethological"
measures
of
anxiety
(
i
.

e
.

risk
assessment
)
were
not
affected
by
metyrapone
.

In
the
open-field
,
the
locomotion-enhancing
effects
of
the
compound
were
not
changed
either
.

These
findings
show
that
monoacylglycerol
lipase
inhibition
dramatically
increases
basal
levels
of
corticosterone
.

This
endocrine
effect
partly
affects
the
anxiolytic
,

not
the
locomotion-enhancing
effects
of
monoacylglycerol

For
several
years
it
is
known
that
beta-adrenergic
receptor
agonists
have
anti-inflammatory
effects
.

However
,
little
is
known
about
the
role
of
beta-adrenergic
receptors
on
macrophages
in
the
modulation
of
cytokine
production
by
beta-agonists
during
inflammation
.

In
this
study
,
the
presence
of
beta-receptors
on
PMA-differentiated
U937
human
macrophages
,
and
the
participation
of
these
receptors
in
the
modulation
of
LPS-mediated
cytokine
production
by
beta-agonists
was
investigated
.

Total
beta-receptor
expression
on
undifferentiated
(
monocyte
)
and
PMA-differentiated
U937
cells
was
established
using
receptor
binding
studies
on
membrane
fractions
with
a
radio
ligand
.

The
expression
of
beta-receptors
proved
to
be
significantly
lower
on
monocytes
than
on
macrophages
,
additionally
a
predominant
expression
of
beta
2-receptors
was
found
.

Production
of
the
cytokines
TNF-alpha
,
IL-6
,
and
IL-10
by
LPS-stimulated
differentiated
U937
cells
was
measured
in
time
.

Peak
concentrations
for
TNF-alpha
,
IL-6
and
IL-10
occurred
at
3
,
12
and
9
hrs
,
respectively
.

When
differentiated
U937
cells
were
incubated
with
both
LPS
and
the
beta-agonist
clenbuterol
the
production
of
TNF-alpha
and
IL-6
was
significantly
reduced
.

However
the
production
of
IL-10
was
increased
.

To
study
the
mechanism
of
modulation
of
cytokine
production
in
more
detail
,
U937
macrophages
were
incubated
with
LPS
/
clenbuterol
in
combination
with
selective
beta
1-
and
beta
2-antagonists
.

These
results
indicated
that
the
beta
2-
and
not
the
beta
1-receptor
is
involved
in
the
anti-inflammatory
activity
of
clenbuterol
.

The
growing
use
of
N-acetylaspartate
as
an
indicator
of
neuronal
viability
has
fostered
interest
in
the
biological
function
(
s
)
of
this
unusual
amino
acid
derivative
.

In
considering
the
various
physiological
roles
that
have
been
proposed
for
this
relatively
abundant
molecule
one
is
obliged
to
take
into
account
its
unusual
metabolic
compartmentalization
,
according
to
which
synthesis
and
storage
occur
in
the
neuron
and
hydrolytic
cleavage
in
the
oligodendrocyte
.

The
latter
reaction
,
catalyzed
by
aspartoacylase
(
ASPA
)
,
produces
acetyl
groups
plus
aspartate
and
has
been
proposed
to
occur
in
both
soluble
and
membranous
subfractions
of
white
matter
.

Our
study
supports
such
bimodal
occurrence
and
we
now
present
immunoblot
,
proteomic
,
and
biochemical
evidence
that
the
membrane-bound
form
of
ASPA
is
intrinsic
to
purified
myelin
membranes
.

This
was
supported
by
a
novel
TLC-based
method
for
the
assay
of
ASPA
.

That
observation
,
together
with
previous
demonstrations
of
numerous
lipid-synthesizing
enzymes
in
myelin
,
suggests
utilization
of
acetyl
groups
liberated
by
myelin-localized
ASPA
for
lipid
synthesis
within
the
myelin
sheath
.

Such
synthesis
might
be
selective
and
could
explain
the
deficit
of
myelin
lipids
in
animals
lacking
ASPA
.
It
has
been
reported
that
cimetidine
,
a
histamine
type-2
receptor
(
H2R
)
antagonist
,
inhibits
the
growth
of
glandular
tumors
such
as
colorectal
cancer
.

However
,
its
effects
against
salivary
gland
tumors
are
still
unknown
.

We
demonstrated
previously
that
human
salivary
gland
tumor
(
HSG
)
cells
spontaneously
express
the
neural
cell
adhesion
molecule
(
NCAM
)
and
also
that
HSG
cell
proliferation
could
be
controlled
via
a
homophilic
(
NCAM-NCAM
)
binding
mechanism
and
that
NCAM
may
be
associated
with
perineural
invasion
by
malignant
salivary
gland
tumors
.

In
the
present
study
,
we
investigated
the
effects
of
cimetidine
via
the
expression
of
NCAM
on
tumor
growth
and
perineural
/
neural
invasion
in
salivary
gland
tumor
cells
.

Expression
of
both
NCAM
mRNA
and
protein
was
found
to
decrease
in
a
dose-dependent
manner
upon
treatment
with
cimetidine
for
24
h
.

The
MTT
assay
and
confocal
laser
microscopy
clearly
showed
that
HSG
cells
underwent
apoptosis
after
treatment
with
cimetidine
.

Activation
of
caspases
3
,
7
,
8
and
9
was
observed
in
HSG
cells
after
cimetidine
treatment
,
thus
confirming
that
the
apoptosis
was
induced
by
the
activated
caspases
.

Apaf-1
activity
was
also
detected
in
HSG
cells
in
a
dose-dependent
manner
after
treatment
with
cimetidine
.

We
also
found
that
the
cimetidine-mediated
down-regulation
of
NCAM
expression
in
HSG
cells
did
not
occur
via
blocking
of
the
histamine
receptor
,
even
though
H2R
expression
was
observed
on
HSG
cells
,
as
two
other
H2R
antagonists
,
famotidine
and
ranitidine
,
did
not
show
similar
effects
.

We
demonstrated
for
the
first
time
that
cimetidine
can
induce
significant
apoptosis
of
salivary
gland
tumor
cells
,
which
express
NCAM
,
at
least
in
part
by
down-regulation
of
NCAM
expression
on
the
cells
.

These
findings
suggest
that
the
growth
,
development
and
perineural
/
neural
invasion
of
salivary
gland
tumor
cells
can
be
blocked
by
cimetidine
administration
through
down-regulation
of
NCAM
expression
,
as
well
as
induction
of
apoptosis
.
The
objective
of
this
study
was
to
examine
the
mechanism
by
which
conjugated

6%
dose
of
10

the

mixture
had
decreased
white

)
and
brown

mass
and
increased
incorporation
of
CLA
isomers
in

and

.

Notably
,
in

receiving
0

2%
of
both

treatments
,
the

levels
of

associated
with

,
including

(

)
,

levels
,
and

,
were
increased
in

.

CLA-induced

in

was
accompanied
by
increases

.

Muscle
cytochrome

These
data
suggest

,
and

The
holo-SDH
crystallized
with
O-methylserine
(
OMS
)
was
also
determined
at
2
.
6
A
resolution
by
molecular
replacement
.

SDH
is
composed
of
two
domains
,
and
each
domain
has
a
typical
alphabeta-open
structure
.

The
active
site
is
located
in
the
cleft
between
the
two
domains
.

The
holo-SDH
contained
PLP-OMS
aldimine
in
the
active
site
,
indicating
that
OMS
can
form
the
Schiff
base
linkage
with
PLP
,
but
the
subsequent
dehydration
did
not
occur
.

Apo-SDH
forms
a
dimer
by
inserting
the
small
domain
into
the
catalytic
cleft
of
the
partner
subunit
so
that
the
active
site
is
closed
.

Holo-SDH
also
forms
a
dimer
by
making
contacts
at
the
back
of
the
clefts
so
that
the
dimerization
does
not
close
the
catalytic
cleft
.

The
phosphate
group
of
PLP
is
surrounded
by
a
characteristic
G-rich
sequence
(
(
168
)
GGGGL
(
172
)
)
and
forms
hydrogen
bonds
with
the
amide
groups
of
those
amino
acid
residues
,
suggesting
that
the
phosphate
group
can
be
protonated
.

N
(
1
)
of
PLP
participates
in
a
hydrogen
bond
with
Cys303
,
and
similar
hydrogen
bonds
with
N
(
1
)
participating
are
seen
in
other
beta-elimination
enzymes
.

These
hydrogen
bonding
schemes
indicate
that
N
(
1
)
is
not
protonated
,
and
thus
,
the
pyridine
ring
cannot
take
a
quinone-like
structure
.

These
characteristics
of
the
bound
PLP
suggest
that
SDH
catalysis
is
not
facilitated
by
forming
the
resonance-stabilized
structure
of
the
PLP-Ser
aldimine
as
seen
in
aminotransferases
.

A
possible
catalytic
mechanism
involves
the
phosphate
group
,
surrounded
by
the
characteristic
sequence
,
acting
as
a
general
acid
to
donate
a
proton
to
the
leaving
hydroxyl
group
of
serine

Perhexiline
,
2-
(
2
,
2-dicyclohexylethyl
)
piperidine
,
was
originally
developed
as
an
anti-anginal
drug
in
the
1970s
.

Despite
its
success
,
its
use
diminished
due
to
the
occurrence
of
poorly
understood
side
effects
including
neurotoxicity
and
hepatotoxicity
in
a
small
proportion
of
patients
.

Recently
,
perhexiline's
mechanism
of
action
and
the
molecular
basis
of
its
toxicity
have
been
elucidated
.

Perhexiline
reduces
fatty
acid
metabolism
through
the
inhibition
of
carnitine
palmitoyltransferase
,
the
enzyme
responsible
for
mitochondrial
uptake
of
long-chain
fatty
acids
.

The
corresponding
shift
to
greater
carbohydrate
utilization
increases
myocardial
efficiency
(
work
done
per
unit
oxygen
consumption
)
and
this
oxygen-sparing
effect
explains
its
antianginal
efficacy
.

Perhexiline's
side
effects
are
attributable
to
high
plasma
concentrations
occurring
with
standard
doses
in
patients
with
impaired
metabolism
due
to
CYP2D6
mutations
.

Accordingly
,
dose
modification
in
these
poorly
metabolizing
patients
identified
through
therapeutic
plasma
monitoring
can
eliminate
any
significant
side
effects
.

Herein
we
detail
perhexiline's
pharmacology
with
particular
emphasis
on
its
mechanism
of
action
and
its
side
effects
.

We
discuss
how
therapeutic
plasma
monitoring
has
led
to
perhexiline's
safe
reintroduction
into
clinical
practice
and
how
recent
clinical
data
attesting
to
its
safety
and
remarkable
efficacy
led
to
a
renaissance
in
its
use
in
both
refractory
angina
and
chronic
heart
failure
.

Finally
,
we
discuss
the
application
of
pharmacogenetics
in
combination
with
therapeutic
plasma
monitoring
to
potentially
broaden
perhexiline's
use
in
heart
failure
,
aortic
stenosis
,
and
other
cardiac
conditions
.
BACKGROUND
:
Recent
epidemiologic
and
laboratory
studies
have
suggested
that
non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory
drugs
(
NSAIDs
)
may
reduce
the
risk
of
breast
cancer
through
inhibition
of
cyclooxygenase-2
(
COX-2
)
.

METHODS
:
We
conducted
a
case-control
study
to
measure
the
association
between
selective
cox-2
inhibitors
,
particularly
celecoxib
,
rofecoxib
,
valdecoxib
and
non-specific
NSAID
subgroups
,
and
breast
cancer
risk
.

Between
2003
and
2006
,
a
total
of
18
,
368
incident
breast
cancer
cases
were
identified
in
the
Ingenix
/
Lab
Rx
insurance
database
,
which
contains
clinical
encounter
and
drug
prescription
data
.

Four
controls
per
case
were
randomly
selected
,
matched
on
age
and
time
in
database
.

Odds
ratios
(
OR
)
and
95%
confidence
intervals
(
CI
)
were
estimated
using
conditional
logistic
regression
.

RESULTS
:
Breast
cancer
risk
was
inversely
associated
with
both
non-specific
NSAID
and
selective
COX-2
inhibitor
use
.

Greater
than
12
months'
duration
of
use
of
Celecoxib
at
a
standard
dose
(
200mg
/
day
)
was
associated
with
a
16%
decrease
in
breast
cancer
risk
(
OR
=
0
.

,
95%
CI
=

)
.

We
observed
the
greatest
risk
reduction
in
association
with
>2
years
of
rofecoxib
exposure
(
OR
=
0
.
54
,
95%
CI
=
0
.
37
,
0
.
80
)
.

Acetaminophen
,
a
compound
with
less
biological
plausibility
for
chemoprevention
,
showed
no
significant
association
with
the
risk
of
developing
breast
cancer
.

CONCLUSION
:
Consistent
with
animal
models
and
laboratory
investigations
,
higher
doses
of
selective
COX-2
inhibitors
were
more
protective
against
breast
cancer
than
non-specific
NSAIDs
.

With
exposure
to
rofecoxib
,
a
selective
COX-2
inhibitor
,
breast
cancer
risk
reduction
was
appreciable
(
46%
)
,
suggesting
a
possible
role
for
selective
COX-2
inhibitors

cells
was
assessed
using

,
and
it
was
shown
that
the

The

gene
(

modulates
the
psychological
response
to

of
the

.

We
quantified
the
vascular
response
to
adenosine
and
caffeine
to
determine
the
relevance
of
this
variant
allele
in
the
physiological
response
to
these

.

We
selected

participants
with

genotype
and

matched
for
activities
of
other

was

.

In
addition
,
the
effect
of

(

was
not

We
conclude
that
the
1976C>T
polymorphism
does
not
affect
the
vascular
response
to
adenosine
and
caffeine
in
humans
in
vivo
.

Therefore
,
this

does
not
contribute

The

receptor
(

)
provides
survival
signals
and
is
overexpressed
in
the
majority
of
colorectal
cancers
.

As
more
is
learned
about
the
molecular
details
of
EGFR
signaling
,
antibodies
can
be
designed
to
interfere
with
specific
domains
of
the
EGFR
molecule
.

In
this
review
,
we
analyze
preclinical
and
current
clinical
data
on
EGFR-targeting
molecules
and
their
potential
role
in
the
treatment
of
colorectal
cancer
.

Cetuximab

It
is
now
approved
by

treatment
.

Panitumumab
is

widely
studied
anti-EGFR
antibody
with
similar
properties
.

Bispecific
antibodies
are
modified
immunoglobulin
molecules
containing
2
different
binding
specificities
.

These
antibodies
can
redirect
the
immune
response
against
tumor
cells
by
tethering
effector
cells
such
as
CD3e-expressing
T
cells
or
CD16-expressing
natural
killer
cells
and
granulocytes
to
the
surface
of

intracellular
tyrosine

domain
of
several
receptors
,

and
thereby
inhibit

These
analyses
provide
new

tools
with
the
aim
of
accurately
distinguishing
malignant

.

They
are
particularly
useful
as
most
of
them
can
be
done
preoperatively
on
thyroid

samples
.

Furthermore
,
molecular
biomarkers
may
play
a
promising
role
since
they
are
able
to
predict
the
prognosis
of
patients
with
thyroid
tumors
.

Moreover
,
identification
of
molecular
markers
as
well
as
a
better
understanding
of
thyroid
carcinogenesis
will
help
develop
innovative
targeted
therapies

Methimazole
(
MMI
)
and
propylthiouracil
(
PTU
)
are
common
antithyroid
drugs
for
treating
hyperthyroidism
because
the
2
drugs
inhibit
thyroid
peroxidase
(
TPO
)
-catalyzed
thyroid
hormone
formation
.

We
studied
whether
the
2
drugs
actually
inhibit
cellular
TPO
activity
in
cultured
porcine
follicles
.

Porcine
follicles
were
cultured
in
the
presence
of
1
mU
/
mL
thyrotropin
(
TSH
)
for
7
days
.

Then
follicles
were
exposed
to
MMI
or
PTU
in
the
presence
of
0

microM
Kl
for
2
days
.

TPO
activity
was
measured
in
the
100
,
000
x
g-pellet
of
the
thyroid
sonicate
by
the
guaiacol
oxidation
method
.

Exposure
to
MMI
(
1
microM
and
10
microM
)
or
PTU
(
10
microM
and
100
microM
)
for
2
days
caused
a
significant
increase
in
cellular
TPO
activity;
100
microM
MMI
inhibited
cellular
TPO
activity
.

The
presence
of
cyclic
adenosine
monophosphate
(
cAMP
)
-generating
system
(
forskolin
)
in
TSH-free
medium
increased
MMI-mediated
TPO
activity
.

Cyclohexamide
inhibited
MMI-mediated
TPO
activation
,
indicating
that
new
protein
synthesis
is
required
for
increased
TPO
activity
.

Reverse
transcriptase-polymerase
chain
reaction
(
RT-PCR
)
showed
an
increase
in
TPO
mRNA
by
PTU
or

.

In
conclusion
,
MMI
and
PTU
at
therapeutic
concentrations
can
increase
TPO
mRNA
and
cellular
TPO
activity
,
although
the
2

The
potency

the
antipsychotic
drug

to
antagonize
alpha
1A-adrenoceptor-mediated

in
rat
perfused
kidney
,
and
alpha
1B-adrenoceptor-mediated

in
spleen
from
guinea-pig
and
mouse
was
evaluated
and
compared
to
that
of
alpha
1-adrenoceptor
subtype-discriminating
antagonists
.

Prazosin
was
found
to
be
unselective;
2-

4-benzodioxane
(

)
,

,
indoramin
and
(

)
-niguldipine
were
confirmed
as
selective
for
the
alpha
1A-adrenoceptor
,
whereas
spiperone
was
weakly
alpha
1B-selective
.

Risperidone
was
equipotent
to
prazosin
at
alpha
1A-adrenoceptors
in
rat
vas
deferens
and
kidney
.

However
,
at
guinea-pig
and
mouse
splenic
alpha
1B-adrenoceptors
,
the
affinity
values
of
risperidone
were
10-fold
lower
than
those
of
prazosin
.

Thus
,
in
functional
experiments
the
presumed
high
selectivity
of
risperidone
for
the
B
subtype
of
alpha
1-adrenoceptors
could
not
be
confirmed
,
the
drug
instead
appears
to
be
moderately
selective
(
10-fold
)
for
the
A
subtype
.

B
cells

Animal
studies
have
identified
that
this

Engagement
of
the

,
can
cause

neutralize
this
activity

by
blocking

or
by
preventing

Epratuzumab
has
distinct
effects
on
cell
growth
from
rituximab
.

For
example
,
rituximab
+
anti-human
IgG
Fcgamma
yielded
marked
inhibition
of
proliferation
in
human
NHL
cell
lines
,
while
epratuzumab
had
little
or
no
effect
in
this
assay
.

However
,
when
cells
were
immobilized
and
stimulated
with
anti-IgM
,
epratuzumab
,
but
not
rituximab
,
caused
a
significant
antiproliferative
effect
.

Unlike
rituximab
,
no
CDC
could
be
detected
,
and
ADCC
was
modest
but
significant
with
epratuzumab
.

Importantly
,
combining
rituximab
and
epratuzumab
did
not
decrease
rituximab's
ability
to
induce
apoptosis
,
CDC
,
and
ADCC
.

In
fact
,
the
combination
is
more
effective
than
rituximab
alone
in
inhibiting
proliferation
of
Daudi
Burkitt
lymphoma
cells
in
the
presence
of
second
antibody
,
and
at
least
equally
effective
to
rituximab
in
the
absence
of
crosslinking
.

These
observations
suggest
that
it
may
be
possible
to
enhance
clinical
efficacy
by
combination
therapy
comprised
of
anti-CD20
and
anti-CD22
mAbs
.
Major
depression
(
MD
)
is
a
major
health
problem
,
partly
due
to
the
incomplete
understanding
of
the
pathogenic
mechanisms
of
the
disease
.

Research
efforts
have
mainly
focused
on
alterations
in
monoaminergic
neurotransmission
,
especially
in
relation
to
the
serotonergic
system
,
due
to
its
key
role
in
the
regulation
of
mood
and
related
biological
functions
.

Given
the
high
heritability
of
MD
(
estimated
between
31%
and
42%
for
unipolar
depression
)
,
genes
coding
for
key
regulators
of
the
serotonergic
neurotransmission
have
been
considered
as
optimal
candidates
.

The
present
review
is
focused
on
the
role
of
genes
coding
for
serotonin
receptors
in
MD
pathogenesis
,
since
the
serotonin
transporter
and
enzymes
involved
in
serotonin
metabolism
have
been
reviewed
elsewhere
.

Despite
the
large
number
of
candidate
gene
studies
focusing
on
genes
coding
for
serotonin
receptors
,
results
have
been
inconsistent
.

The
most
replicated
findings
are
the
associations
between
rs6295
(
HTR1A
gene
)
G
allele
or
G
/
G
genotype
and
rs6311
(
HTR2A
gene
)
A
allele
or
A
/
A
genotype
and
MD
or
depressive
symptoms
.

Preclinical
and
imaging
/
post-mortem
studies
in
humans
provide
strong
support
for
the
involvement
of
HTR1A
and
HTR2A
genes
in
MD
.

Nevertheless
,
the
inconsistency
across
previous
studies
clearly
suggests
that
innovative
approaches
should
be
designed
in
order
to
overcome
the
limitations
of
candidate
gene
studies
.

To
date
,
the
most
appealing
methodologies
seem
to
be
full
exome
or
genome
sequencing
,
genome-wide
pathway
analyses
,
endophenotypes
,
and
epigenetic
biomarkers
.

The
reported
tools
may
assist
in
the
detection
of
multiple-loci
models
,
which
could
potentially
explain
the
high
percentage
of
MD
susceptibility
ascribed
to
genetic
factors
.

We
have
studied
the
alpha
1-adrenoceptor
subtypes
mediating
inotropic
effects
of
adrenaline
in
rat
right

and
the

sources
used
to
elicit

.

alpha

effects
in

were
studied
for

Treatment
with
chloroethylclonidine
did
not
affect
the
maximal
beta-adrenoceptor-mediated
inotropic
effects
in
rat
right
ventricle
or
the
maximal
alpha
1A-adrenoceptor-mediated
contractile
effects
in

vas
deferens;
it
did
not
alter
the
potency
of
isoprenaline
in
the
ventricle
and
reduced
the
potency
of
the
alpha-adrenoceptor
antagonists
in
vas
deferens
only
slightly
.

Treatment
of
right
ventricular
strips
with
CdCl2
markedly
reduced
resting
tension
and
enhanced
maximal
inotropic
effects
of
isoprenaline
but
did
not
affect
its
potency
.

Inactivation
of
cardiac
alpha
1B-adrenoceptors
by
treatment
with
chloroethylclonidine
slightly
enhanced
the
maximal
inotropic
effects
of
the
full
agonist
,
adrenaline
and
of
several
partial
agonists
.

Schild
analysis

experiments
with
the
alpha
1A-adrenoceptor-selective
antagonists
,
5-methyl-urapidil
and
(

-
)
-tamsulosin
,
demonstrated
that
adrenaline
causes
its
inotropic
effects
mainly
via
the
alpha
1B-adrenoceptor
subtype
.

Schild
analysis
of
5-methyl-urapidil
inhibition
experiments
in
chloroethylclonidine-treated
ventricles
indicated
that
only
alpha
1A-adrenoceptors
mediate
the
inotropic
effects
of
adrenaline
following
inactivation
of
the
alpha
1B-adrenoceptors
.

.

In
control
ventricles
the
organic
Ca2

entry
blocker
,
nitrendipine
and
treatment
with
the
inorganic
Ca2
+
entry
blocker
,
CdCl2
did
not
reduce
inotropic
effects
of
adrenaline
whereas
ryanodine
treatment
inhibited
them
.

In
contrast
,
nitrendipine
and
CdCl2
treatment
had
major
inhibitory
effects
in
chloroethylclonidine-treated
but
lacked
inhibitory
effects
in
phenoxybenzamine-treated
ventricular
strips
.

6
.

We
conclude
that
inotropic
effects
of
adrenaline
in
rat
heart
are
mediated
mainly
by
alpha
1B-adrenoceptors
via
release
of
Ca2
+
from
an
intracellular
pool
.

Following
inactivation
of
alpha
1B-adrenoceptors
by
chloroethylclonidine
treatment
,
alpha
lA-adrenoceptors
can
fully
compensate
and
mediate
inotropic
effects
by
promoting
influx
of
extracellular
Ca2
+
at
least
partly
via
voltage-operated
channels
.

Therefore
,
we
speculate
that
alpha
1B-adrenoceptors
exert
a
tonic
inhibitory
effect
on
alpha
1A-adrenoceptors
.

Dofetilide

Like
other
members
of
this
class
of
K

channel
blockers
,
the
sites
in
the
channel
to
which
the
drug
binds
are
unknown
,
although
high
and
low
affinity
binding
has
been
reported
in
cardiomyocytes
.

The
most
sensitive
K

channel
target
for
dofetilide
seems
to
be
IKr
,
the
rapid
component
of
the
repolarizing
delayed

K

current
.

However
,
block
of
other
K
+
channels
occurs
at
higher
concentrations
and
is
of
special
interest
in
regard
to
toxicity
.

Recently
,
we
have
demonstrated
that
hIRK
,
a
cloned
inward
rectifier
K
+
channel
(
IRK
)
isolated
from
human
atrium
and
expressed
heterologously
in
Xenopus
oocytes
,
is
blocked
by
dofetilide
.

We
report
the
localization
of
a
site
that
is
critical
for
dofetilide
block
in
hIRK
.

We
used
chimeric
constructs
between
hIRK
and
ROMK1
,
a
related
inward
rectifier
that
is
drug
resistant
.

Substitution
of
hIRK-M2
,
the
second
putative
transmembrane
spanning
segment
of
IRKs
,
with
ROMK1-M2
increased
unblocking
of
dofetilide
by
10-20-fold
in
hIRK
.

Site-directed
mutagenesis
further
pinpointed
the
effects
to
a
single
hydrophobic
residue
(
I177
)
in
M2
.

A
reduction
in
hydrophobicity
by
the
point

I177C
increased
recovery
from

to

,
leading
us
to
suggest
that
hydrophobic
interactions
are
essential
for
dofetilide
block
in
hIRK
.

A
similar
mechanism
may
explain
dofetilide
block
in
other

channels
,

The
increased
resistance
of
hypoxic
cells
to
all
forms
of
cancer
therapy
presents
a
major
barrier
to
the
successful
treatment
of
most
solid
tumors
.

Inhibition
of
the
essential
kinase
,
Checkpoint
kinase
1
(
Chk1
)
has
been
described
as
a
promising
cancer
therapy
for
tumors
with
high
levels
of
hypoxia-induced
replication
stress
.

However
,
as
inhibition
of
Chk1
affects
normal
replication
and
induces
DNA
damage
,
these
agents
also
have
the
potential
to
induce
genomic
instability
and
contribute
to
tumorigenesis
.

To
overcome
this
problem
,
we
have
developed
a
bioreductive
prodrug
,
which
functions
as
a
Chk1
/
Aurora
A
inhibitor
specifically
in
hypoxic
conditions
.

To
achieve
this
activity
,
a
key
functionality
on
the
Chk1
inhibitor
(
CH-01
)
is
masked
by
a
bioreductive
group
,
rendering
the
compound
inactive
as
a
Chk1
/
Aurora
A
inhibitor
.

Reduction
of
the
bioreductive
group
nitro
moiety
,
under
hypoxic
conditions
,
reveals
an
electron-donating
substituent
that
leads
to
fragmentation
of
the
molecule
,
affording
the
active
inhibitor
.

Most
importantly
,
we
show
a
significant
loss
of
viability
in
cancer
cell
lines
exposed
to
hypoxia
in
the
presence
of
CH-01
.

This
novel
approach
targets
the
most
aggressive
and
therapy-resistant
tumor
fraction
while
protecting
normal
tissue
from
therapy-induced
genomic
instability
.
The

Compound

In
breast
tumors
IGF
binding
protein-2
(
IGFBP-2
)
is
elevated
,
and
the
presence
of
IGFBP-2
has
been
shown
to
correlate
with
malignancy
.

However
,
how
IGFBP-2
contributes
to
the
malignant
state
is
still
unclear
.

Silencing
IGFBP-2
blocked
cell
proliferation
and
in
MCF-7
cells
increased
cell
death
,
indicating
that
IGFBP-2
was
acting
in
both
a
mitogenic
and
a
survival
capacity
.

Exogenous
IGFBP-2
acting
via
integrin
receptors
to
reduce
phosphatase
and
tensin
homolog
deleted
from
chromosome
10
(
PTEN
)
levels
protected
these
cells
against
death
induced
by
various
chemotherapeutic
agents
.

This
was
dependent
on
a
functional
estrogen
receptor
(
ER
)
-α
because
silencing
ER-α
blocked
the
ability
of
IGFBP-2
to
confer
cell
survival
.

Loss
of
IGFBP-2
increased
levels
of
PTEN
and
improved
chemosensitivity
of
the
cells
,
confirming
its
role
as
a
survival
factor
.

Silencing
IGFBP-2
had
no
effect
on
the
response
to
IGF-II
,
but
responses
to
estrogen
and
tamoxifen
were
no
longer
observed
due
to
loss
of
ER-α
,
which
could
be
prevented
by
the
inhibition
of
PTEN
.

Conversely
,
exogenous
IGFBP-2
increased
ER-α
mRNA
and
protein
in
both
normal
and
cancer
cells
via
its
interaction
with
integrin
receptors
.

These
actions
of
IGFBP-2
on
ER-α
involved
the
IGF-I
receptor
and
activation
of
phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase
in
the
cancer
cells
but
were
independent
of
this
in
normal
breast
cells
.

The
production
of
IGFBP-2
by
breast
cancer
cells
enhances
their
proliferative
potential
,
increases
their
survival
,
and
protects
them
against
chemotherapy-induced
death
.

IGFBP-2
not
only
modulates
IGFs
and
directly
regulates
PTEN
but
also
has
a
role
in
maintaining
ER-α
expression
.

The
present
study
was
conducted
with
the
goal
of
shedding
more
light
onto
the
role
of
connexin43
in
primary
hepatocyte
cultures
.

Connexin43
expression
was
suppressed
by
means
of
RNA
interference
technology
,
and
the
overall
outcome
of
this
treatment
on
the
hepatocellular
proteome
and
metabolome
was
investigated
using
tandem
mass
tag-based
differential
protein
profiling
and
(

)
H
NMR
spectroscopy
,
respectively
.

Global
protein
profiling
revealed
a
number
of
targets
of
the
connexin43
knock-down
procedure
,
including
mitochondrial
proteins
(
heat
shock
protein
60
,
glucose-regulated
protein
75
,
thiosulphate
sulphurtransferase
and
adenosine
triphosphate
synthase
)
and
detoxifying
enzymes
(
glutathione
S-transferase
μ
2
and
cytochrome

)
.

At
the
metabolomic
level
,
connexin43
silencing
caused
no
overt
changes
,
though
there
was
some
evidence
for
a
subtle
increase
in
intracellular
glycine
quantities
.

Collectively
,
these
data
could
further
substantiate
the
established
existence
of
a
mitochondrial
connexin
pool
and
could
be
reconciled
with
the
previously
reported
involvement
of
connexin43
signalling
in
spontaneously
occurring

in

,
currently
in

development
for
use
in
the
treatment
of

Initial

of
the
pharmacological
properties
of
DVS
(

significantly
reduced

Using

,
this
difference
in
potency
for
DVS
at
sites
labeled
by
[

was
found
to
distinguish
DVS

from
other

antagonists
,
such
as
NIS
,

,
and

.

These
differences
seem
not
to
arise
from
preparation-specific
perturbations
of
ligand

or
antagonist-specific
surface
trafficking
but
rather
from
protein

alterations
that
perturb
the

In

ETHOPHARMACOLOGICAL
RELEVANCE
:
Mitragynine
is
an
indole
alkaloid
compound
of
Mitragyna
speciosa
(
M
.

speciosa
)
Korth
.

(
Rubiaceae
)
.

This
plant
is
native
to
the
southern
regions
of
Thailand
and
northern
regions
of
Malaysia
and
is
frequently
used
to
manage
the
withdrawal
symptoms
in
both
countries
.

AIM
OF
STUDY
:
To
investigate
the
effect
of
mitragynine
after
chronic
morphine
treatment
on
cyclic
AMP
(
cAMP
)
level
and
mRNA
expression
of
mu-opioid
receptor
(
MOR
)
in
human
neuroblastoma
SK-N-SH
cell
.

METHOD
AND
MATERIALS
:
Mitragynine
was
isolated
from
the
Mitragyna
speciosa
plant
using
the
acid-base
extraction
method
.

The
cAMP
level
upon
forskolin
stimulation
in
the
cells
was
determined
using
the
Calbiochem
(
®
)
Direct
Immunoassay
Kit
.

The
mRNA
expression
of
the
MOR
was
carried
out
using
quantitative
RT-PCR
.

RESULT
:
Cotreatment
and
pretreatment
of
morphine
and
mitragynine
significantly
reduced
the
production
of
cAMP
level
at
a
lower
concentration
of
nitrogen
while
the
higher
concentration
of
this
compound
could
lead
to
the
development
of
tolerance
and
dependence
as
shown
by
the
increase
of
the
cAMP
level
production
in
foskolin
stimulation
.

In
MOR
mRNA
expression
study
,
cotreatment
of
morphine
with
mitragynine
significantly
reduced
the
down-regulation
of
MOR
mRNA
expression
as
compared
to
morphine
treatment
only
.

CONCLUSION
:
These
finding
suggest
that
mitragynine
could
possibly
avoid
the
tolerance
and
dependence
on
chronic
morphine
treatment
by
reducing
the
up-regulation
of
cAMP
level
as
well
as
reducing
the
down-regulation
of
MOR
at
a
lower
concentration
of
mitragynine
.
Huge
advances
achieved
recently
in
elucidating
the
role
of
NO
in
plants

possible
by
the
application

However
,
the
application

be
subjected

Not

At

the

rate
of

was
found
for

followed
by

The

was

for

for

A
temporary
lack
of

inhibited
NO

from

,
both
in

and
SNP-treated

,
which
was
measured
by
the
electrochemical
method

showed

The
authors
of
this

would
like
to
polemicize
with
the
commonly
cited
statement
that
"donors
are
compounds
that
spontaneously
break
down
to
release
NO"
and
wish
to
point
out
the
fact
that
the
process
of
donor
decomposition
depends
on
the
numerous
external
factors
.

It
may
be
additionally
stimulated
or
inhibited
by
live
plant
tissue
,
thus
it
is
necessary
to
take
into
consideration
these
aspects
and
monitor
the
amount
of
NO
released
by
the
donor
.

BACKGROUND
:
(

)
-Modafinil
has
piqued
interest
as
a
treatment
for
attention-deficit
/
hyperactivity
disorder
and
stimulant
dependence
.

The
R-enantiomer
of
modafinil
might
have
unique
pharmacological
properties
that
should
be
further
investigated
.

METHODS
:
(

/

)
-Modafinil
and
its
R-
(

)
-
and
S-
(
+
)
-enantiomers
were
synthesized
and
tested
for
inhibition

with

.

Data
were
compared
with
cocaine
and
the
atypical
DA
uptake
inhibitor
,
JHW

.

R-
and
S-modafinil
were
also
evaluated
in
microdialysis
studies
in
the
mouse
nucleus
accumbens
shell
and
in
a
cocaine
discrimination
procedure
.

RESULTS
:
(
+
/
-
)
-
,
R-
,
and
S-modafinil
bind
to
the
DAT
and
inhibit
DA
uptake
less
potently
than
cocaine
,
with
R-modafinil
having
approximately
threefold
higher
affinity
than
its
S-enantiomer
.

Molecular
docking
studies
revealed
subtle
differences
in
binding
modes
for
the
enantiomers
.

R-modafinil
was
significantly
less
potent
in
the
DAT
Y156F
mutant
compared
with
wild-type
DAT
,
whereas
S-modafinil
was
affected
less
.

Studies
with
the
Y335A
DAT
mutant
showed
that
the
R-
and
S-enantiomers
tolerated
the
inward-facing
conformation
better
than
cocaine
,
which
was
further
supported
by
[
2-
(
trimethylammonium
)
ethyl
]
-methanethiosulfonate
reactivity
on
the
DAT
E2C
I159C
.

Microdialysis
studies
demonstrated
that
both
R-
and
S-modafinil
produced
increases
in
extracellular
DA
concentrations
in
the
nucleus
accumbens
shell
less
efficaciously
than
cocaine
and
with
a
longer
duration
of
action
.

Both
enantiomers
fully
substituted
in
mice
trained
to
discriminate
cocaine
from
saline
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
R-modafinil
displays
an
in
vitro
profile
different
from
cocaine
.

Future
trials
with
R-modafinil
as
a
substitute
therapy
with
the
potential
benefit
of
cognitive
enhancement
for
psychostimulant

are
warranted

Some
Gram-positive
bacterial
pathogens
harbor
a
gene
that
encodes
a
protein
(
HNS
,
Heme
domain
of
NO
Synthase-like
proteins
)
with
striking
sequence
identity
to
the
oxygenase
domain
of
mammalian
NO
synthases
(
NOS
)
.

However
,
they
lack
the
N-terminal
and
the
Zn-cysteine
motif
participating
to
the
stability
of
an
active
dimer
in
the
mammalian
isoforms
.

The
unique
properties
of
HNS
make
it
an
excellent
model
system
for
probing
how
the
heme
environment
tunes
NO
dynamics
and
for
comparing
it
to
the
endothelial
NO
synthase
heme
domain
(
eNOS
(
HD
)
)
using
ultrafast
transient
spectroscopy
.

NO
rebinding
in
HNS
from
Staphylococcus
aureus
(
SA-HNS
)
is
faster
than
that
measured
for
either
Bacillus
anthracis
(
BA-HNS
)
or
for
eNOS
(
HD
)
in
both
oxidized
and
reduced
forms
in
the
presence
of
arginine
.

To
test
whether
these
distinct
rates
arise
from
different
energy
barriers
for
NO
recombination
,
we
measured
rebinding
kinetics
at
several
temperatures
.

Our
data
are
consistent
with
different
barriers
for
NO
recombination
in
SA-HNS
and
BA-HNS
and
the
presence
of
a
second
NO-binding
site
.

The
hypothesis
that
an
additional
NO-binding
cavity
is
present
in
BA-HNS
is
also
consistent
with
the
effect
of
the
NO
concentration
on
its
rebinding
.

The
lack
of
the
effect
of
NO
concentration
on
the
geminate
rebinding
in
SA-HNS
could
be
due
to
an
isolated
second
site
.

We
confirm
the
existence
of
a
second
NO
site
in
the
oxygenase
domain
of
the
reduced
eNOS
as
previously
hypothesized

Genetic
engineering
has
led
to
the
development
of
fusion
protein
toxins
,
which
are
targeted
effector
molecules
that
combine
a
targeting
ligand
such
as
a
growth
factor
with
a
cytocidal
moiety
such
as
a
plant
or
bacterial
toxin
.

The
first
genetically
constructed
family
of
fusion
proteins
used
diphtheria
toxin
as
the
toxophore
for
receptor-binding
domain
substitution
.

Diphtheria
toxin
consists
of
three
domains
:
an
enzymatically
active
adenosine
diphosphate
(
ADP
)
ribosyltransferase
domain
,
a
hydrophobic
transmembrane
domain
,
and
a
C-terminal
receptor-binding
domain
.

Introduction
of
the
enzymatically
active
domain
into
the
cytosol
via
receptor-mediated
endocytosis
results
in
inhibition
of
protein
synthesis
by
ADP
ribosylation
of
elongation-factor

.

DAB
(

IL-2
,
in
which
the
native
receptor-binding
domain
of
diphtheria
toxin
was
replaced
with
the
full-length
interleukin-2
(
IL-2
)
gene
,
was
capable
of
intoxicating
high-affinity
IL-2
receptor-bearing
cells
in

with
an
IC
(

of
10

M;
whereas
,
cells
lacking
the
full
component
of
the
high-affinity
IL-2
receptor
(
p55
,
p75
,
p64
)
were
relatively
resistant
(
IC
(
50
)
of
10
(

)
M
)
.

Because
of
a
short
in
vivo
half-life
of
DAB
(
486
)
IL-2
,
efforts
to
reengineer
the
molecule
were
undertaken
,
leading
to
the
DAB
(
389
)
IL-2
construct
,
which
had
a
twofold
to
threefold
higher
Kd
than
DAB
(
486
)
IL-2
and
a
longer
half-life
,
resulting
in
a
tenfold
increase
in
potency
.

Thus
far
,
the
clinical
activity
of
both
IL-2
chimeric

has
been
similar

with
the

to
elucidate
the
effects
of
STX
on
Hoplias
malabaricus
through
trophic
bioassay
.

The
fish
were
fed
once
every
five
days
with
Astyanax
sp
.

before
being
subjected
to
an
intraperitoneal
inoculation
with
the
lysate
of
Cylindrospermopsis
raciborskii
culture
containing
97%
STX
and
3%
by
neosaxitoxin
and
gonyautoxin
during
20
days
.

The
animal's
liver
was
assessed
using
biomarkers
as
activities
of
superoxide
dismutase
(
SOD
)
,
catalase
(
CAT
)
,
glutathione
S-transferase
(
GST
)
,
and
glutathione
peroxidase
(
GPx
)
,
and
concentrations
of
reduced
glutathione
(
GSH
)
and
lipoperoxidation
(
LPO
)
and
protein
carbonylation
(
PCO
)
.

In
the
blood
was
analyzed
the
genotoxic
and
hematological
parameters
.

The
hepatosomatic
index
and
the
relative
condition
factor
did
not
show
a
significant
difference
between
the
exposed
and
control
groups
.

The
values
of
mean
corpuscular
hemoglobin
concentration
and
mean
corpuscular
hemoglobin
increased
in
the
STX
group
.

The
hepatic
tissue
from
both
groups
exhibited
a
typical
pattern
that
have
been
already
described
for
most
teleost
fish
.

The
results
suggested
the
generation
of
reactive
oxygen
species
,
with
increased
activity
of
GPx
and
concentrations
of
LPO
and
GSH;
whereas
the
specific
activity
of
SOD
decreased
.

However
,
no
changes
were
observed
in
the
CAT
,
PCO
,
and
DNA
damage
.

Although
the
STX
effects
are
known
as
neurotoxic
,
this
cyanotoxin
caused
liver
biochemical
alterations
that
can
be
considered
ecologically
relevant
.
BACKGROUND
:
We
describe
a
rare
case
of
congenital
hypothyroidism
and
an
extremely
high
serum
thyrotropin
(
TSH
)
level
caused
by
a
combination
of
resistance
to
thyroid
hormone
(
RTH
)
and
a
lingual
thyroid
.

As
the
RTH
mutant
,
R316C
,
was
new
,
the
optimum
dose
of
levothyroxine
was
unclear
.

To
aid
in
assessment
of
the
therapy
,
we
characterized
the
mutant
R316C
thyroid
hormone
receptor
(
TR
)
and
compared
it
with
a
common
mutant
,
R316H
,
using
in
vitro
studies
.

SUMMARY
:
The
patient
was
a
newborn
female
having
severe
hypothyroidism
with
a
free
thyroxine
level
of
0
.
36
ng
/
dL
and
a
serum
TSH
level
of
177
microU
/
mL
.

A
scintiscan
showed
ectopic
lingual
thyroid
tissue
without
a
normal
thyroid
gland
.

Supplementation
with
levothyroxine
at
a
dose
of
>350
microg
/
day
did
not
normalize
the
serum
TSH
level;
however
,
the
patient
showed
normal
growth
and
intelligence
at
14
years
of
age
.

Consistent
with
the
results
of
a
computer
analysis
,
the
binding
of
R316C
to
triiodothyronine
(
T3
)
was
significantly
decreased
to
38%
that
of
the
wild
type
.

Electrophoretic
mobility
shift
assay
demonstrated
that
like
R316H
,
R316C
did
not
form
a
homodimer
,
but
formed
a
heterodimer
with
RXR
.

However
,
a
glutathione-S-transferase
pull-down
assay
showed
reduced
binding
of
R316C
with
NCoR
in
the
absence
of
T3
and
impaired
release
in
the
presence
of
T3
.

In
addition
,
transient
transfection
experiments
demonstrated
that
unlike
R316H
,
R316C
had
severe
impairment
of
transcriptional
activity
on
genes
both
positively
and
negatively
regulated
by
thyroid
hormone
.

It
also
had
a
clear
dominant
negative
effect
on
genes
negatively
,
but
not
positively
,
regulated
by
thyroid
hormone
,
including
the
TSH-releasing
hormone
and
TSHbeta
genes
.

CONCLUSION
:
This
is
the
first
reported
case
of
a
R316C
TR
mutation
.

The
characteristics
of
the
R316C
mutant
differed
from
those
of
the
R316H
mutant
.

Our
findings
suggest
that
R316C
causes
reduced
association
with
and
impaired
release
of
NCoR
,
resulting
in
RTH
predominantly
at
the
pituitary
level
,
and
that
slightly
elevated
serum
TSH
level
with
high
dose
of
levothyroxine
might
be
optimum
for
normal
growth
.

Human
Organic
Anion
Transporting
Polypeptide
2B1
(
OATP2B1
)
is
a
membrane
transporter
that
facilitates
the
cellular
uptake
of
a
number
of
endogenous
compounds
and
drugs
.

OATP2B1
is
widely
expressed
in
tissues
including
the
small
intestine
,
liver
,
kidney
,
placenta
,
heart
,
skeletal
muscle
and
platelets
.

Recently
,
it
has
been
shown
that
differential
promoter
usage
in
tissues
results
in
expression
of
five
OATP2B1
transcriptional
start
site
variants
which
utilize
distinct
first
exons
but
share
common
subsequent
exons
.

These
variants
are
expected
to
encode
either
a
full
length
(
OATP2B1-FL
)
or
shortened
protein
lacking
22
N-terminus
amino
acids
(
OATP2B-Short
)
.

Little
is
known
regarding
the
transport
activity
and
regulation
of
OATP2B1
variants
with
N-terminus
truncation
.

Here
,
using
absolute
quantitative
polymerase
chain
reaction
we
find
the
full
length
variant
is
the
major
form
expressed
in
duodenum
but
the
short
variant
predominates
in
liver
.

Using
a
transient
heterologous
cell
expression
system
,
we
find
that
the
transport
activities
of
the
short
OATP2B1
variant
towards
substrates
estrone
sulfate
and
rosuvastatin
are
similar
to
the
well-characterized
full
length
variant
.

Transcriptional
activity
screening
of
the
liver
enriched
OATP2B1
variant
promoter
identified
hepatocyte
nuclear
factor
4
alpha
(
HNF4α
)
as
a
novel
transacting
factor
.

With
a
combination
of
in
silico
screening
,
promoter
mutation
in
cell-based
reporter
assays
,
siRNA
knockdown
and
chromatin
immunoprecipitation
studies
,
we
identified
a
functional
HNF4α
binding
site
close
to
the
transcription
start
site
(
-17
to
-4
bp
)
.

We
conclude
that
the
major
OATP2B1
protein
form
in
liver
is
transport
competent
and
its
hepatic
expression
is
regulated
by
HNF4α
.
Neuroprotective
role
of
ATP-sensitive
potassium

in
cerebral
ischemia
.
Amine
oxidase
activity
,
previously
described
in
homogenates
of
brown
adipose
tissue
of
the
rat
,
has
now
been
investigated
in
preparations
of
isolated
fat
cells
.

It
was
found
that
the
specific
activities
of
both
monoamine
oxidase
A
(
MAO
)
and
of
the
semicarbazide-sensitive
clorgyline-resistant
amine
oxidase
(
SSAO
)
were
higher
in
isolated
fat
cells
than
in
the
original
whole
tissue
.

Brown
adipocytes
therefore
represent
a
major
source
of
both
these
enzymes
.

In
plasma
membranes
prepared
from
these
isolated
brown
fat
cells
by
borate
extraction
there
was
a
similar
enrichment
of
activity
of
SSAO
and
of
the
plasma
membrane
marker
enzyme
,
phosphodiesterase
I
.

However
in
preparations
of
cell
membranes
made
by
binding
the
cells
to
polycation-coated
beads
,
enrichment
of
phosphodiesterase
I
activity
was
much
greater
than
that
of
SSAO
.

It
is
suggested
that
the
disposition
of
the
enzyme
within
the
cell
membrane
may
account
for
the
discrepancy
in
these
results
,
i
.

e
.

the
sidedness
of
the
membrane
may
be
important
.

Histochemical
visualization
of
enzyme
activity
in
whole
tissue
at
the
ultrastructural
level
was
undertaken
.

Positive
staining
of
mitochondria
was
achieved
in
the
presence
of
the
MAO
substrate
,
tryptamine
.

Staining
around
the
edges
of
the
brown
fat
cells
was
observed
with
the
SSAO
substrates
,
tyramine
and
benzylamine
.

Staining
was
largely
absent
when
substrate
was
omitted
or
after
pretreatment
with
the
irreversible
SSAO
inhibitor
,
hydralazine
and
the
slowly
reversible
inhibitor
,
semicarbazide
.

It
is
not
definitely
proven
that
this
staining
represents
sites
of
enzyme
activity
but
the
results
are
consistent
with
evidence
from
other
studies
indicating
that
SSAO
in
brown
adipose
tissue
of
the
rat
may
be
found
predominantly
at
the
fat
cell
surface
.

ABSTRACT
TRUNCATED

Minocycline
and
neurodegenerative
diseases
.
Our
understanding
of
the
molecular
pathogenesis
of
the
neuromuscular
ion
channelopathies
has
increased
rapidly
over
the
past
two
decades
due
to
the
identification
of
many
of
the
genes
whose
mutation
causes
these
diseases
.

These
molecular
discoveries
have
facilitated
identification
and
classification
of
the
hereditary
periodic
paralyses
and
the
myotonias
,
and
are
likely
to
shed
light
on
acquired
ion
channelopathies
as
well
.

Despite
our
better
understanding
of
the
pathogenesis
of
these
disorders
,
current
treatments
are
largely
empirical
and
the
evidence
in
favor
of
specific
therapy
largely
anecdotal
.

For
periodic
paralysis
,
dichlorphenamide--a
carbonic
anhydrase
inhibitor--has
been
shown
in
a
controlled
trial
to
prevent
attacks
for
many
patients
with
both
hypokalemic
and
hypokalemic
periodic
paralysis
.

A
second
trial
,
comparing
dichlorphenamide
with
acetazolamide
versus
placebo
,
is
currently
in
progress
.

For
myotonia
,
there
is
only
anecdotal
evidence
for
treatment
,
but
a
controlled
trial
of
mexiletine
versus
placebo
is
currently
being
funded
by
a
Food
and
Drug
Administration-orphan
products
grant
and
is
scheduled
to
begin
in
late
2008
.

In
the
future
,
mechanism-based
approaches
are
likely
to
be
developed
.

For
example
,
exciting
advances
have
already
been
made
in
one
disorder
,
myotonic
dystrophy-1
(
DM-1
)
.

In
a
mouse
model
of
DM-1
,
a
morpholino
antisense
oligonucleuotide
targeting
the
3'
splice
site
of
CLCN1
exon
7a
repaired
the
RNA
splicing
defect
by
promoting
the
production
of
full-length
chloride
channel
transcripts
.

Abnormal
chloride
conductance
was
restored
,
and
myotonia
was
abolished
.

Similar
strategies
hold
potential
for
DM-2
.

The
era
of
molecularly-based
treatments
is
about
to
begin
.
Opportunistic
infections
caused
by
Pneumocystis
jirovecii
(
P
.

jirovecii
,
pj
)
,
Toxoplasma
gondii
(
T
.

gondii
,
tg
)
and
Mycobacterium
avium
(
M
.

avium
,
ma
)
are
the
principal
causes
of
morbidity
and
mortality
in
patients
with
acquired
immunodeficiency
syndrome
(
AIDS
)
.

The
absence
of
any
animal
models
for
human
Pneumocystis
jirovecii
pneumonia
and
the
lack
of
crystal
structures
of
pjDHFR
and
tgDHFR
make
the
design
of
inhibitors
challenging
.

A
novel
series
of
pyrido
[
2
,
3-d
]
pyrimidines
as
selective
and
potent
DHFR
inhibitors
against
these
opportunistic
infections
are
presented
.

Buchwald-Hartwig
coupling
reaction
of
substituted
anilines
with
pivaloyl
protected
2
,
4-diamino-6-bromo-pyrido
[
2
,
3-d
]
pyrimidine
was
successfully
explored
to
synthesize
these
analogs
.

Compound
26
was
the
most
selective
inhibitor
with
excellent
potency
against
pjDHFR
.

Molecular
modeling
studies
with
a
pjDHFR
homology
model
explained
the
potency
and
selectivity
of
26
.

Structural
data
are
also
reported
for
26
with
pcDHFR
and
16
and
22
with
variants
of
pcDHFR
.

of
the
NSAID
tolmetin
,
on
lipid

and

in
rat
gastric
mucosa
,
colon
mucosa
and
liver
,
were
compared
with
the
effects
of
non-selective
(
indomethacin
,
diclofenac
)
and
COX-2
selective
(
celecoxib
)
NSAIDs
.

.

Indomethacin
treatment
led
to
an
increase
in
lipid
peroxidation
,
glutathione
peroxidase
and
glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase
activities
and
to
a
decrease
in
catalase
activity
and
glutathione
levels
in
gastric
mucosa
.

In
contrast
,
amtolmetin
guacyl
treatment
was
without
effects
in
gastric
and
colon
mucosa
,
or
liver
from
control
animals
.

Like
amtolmetin
guacyl
,
celecoxib
had
no
effect
on
the
lipid
peroxidation
,
or
on
enzyme
and
non-enzyme
antioxidant
defence
systems
in
gastric
mucosa
.

.

It
is
suggested
that
the
lack
of
pro-oxidant
effects
in
vivo
associated
with
amtolmetin
guacyl
treatment
contribute
improved
gastric
tolerability
.
RATIONALE
:
Prior
research
has
found
that
adults
with
attention-deficit
/
hyperactivity
disorder
(
ADHD
)
show
increased
sensitivity
to
the
impairing
effects
of
alcohol
(
Weafer
et
al
.

,
Exp
Clin
Psychopharmacol
17
:
113-121
,
2009
)
.

However
,
these
studies
have
focused
exclusively
on
the
ascending
limb
of
the
blood
alcohol
concentration
(
BAC
)
curve
,
and
it
is
unclear
whether
these
adults
continue
to
show
increased
sensitivity
during
the
later
phase
of
the
dose
as
BAC
is
declining
.

OBJECTIVE
:
This
study
tested
the
hypothesis
that
those
with
ADHD
would
display
increased
response
to
alcohol
during
the
ascending
limb
of
the
BAC
curve
and
less
recovery
from
the
impairing
effects
during
the
descending
limb
.

METHODS
:
Adult
social
drinkers
with
ADHD
and
control
adults
completed
measures
of
motor
coordination
,
reaction
time
(
RT
)
,
and
subjective
intoxication
twice
following
0
.
64
g
/
kg
alcohol
and
placebo
.

The
measures
were
administered
during
the
ascending
limb
of
the
BAC
curve
and
again
during
the
descending
limb
.

RESULTS
:
During
the
ascending
limb
,
alcohol
reduced
motor
coordination
,
slowed
RT
,
and
increased
self-reports
of
subjective
intoxication
.

Those
with
ADHD
displayed
greater
impairment
of
motor
coordination
compared
with
controls
.

During
the
descending
limb
,
controls
reported
diminished
subjective
intoxication
and
showed
recovery
from
the
impairing
effects
of
alcohol
on
both
their
motor
coordination
and
their
RT
.

Those
with
ADHD
showed
reduced
subjective
intoxication
and
faster
RT
during
this
time
,
but
they
did
not
recover
motor
control
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
The
protracted
time
course
of
motor
impairment
in
adults
with
ADHD
despite
reductions
in
subjective
intoxication
may
contribute
to
poor
decision
making
and
diminished
behavioral
control
in
this
group
.
A
likely
endocrine
control
mechanism
for
sexual
differentiation
in
size-graded
populations
of
European
sea
bass
(
Dicentrarchus
labrax
)
is
proposed
by
evaluating
the
brain
expression
and
pituitary
content
of
two
forms
of
gonadotropin-releasing
hormone
(
GnRH
)
,
namely
sea
bream
(
sbGnRH
)
and
salmon
(
sGnRH
)
,
the
pituitary
expression
of
one
subtype
of
GnRH
receptor
(
dlGnRH-R-2A
)
and
the
three
gonadotropin
(
GtH
)
subunits
,
namely
glycoprotein
alpha
(
GPalpha
)
,
follicle-stimulating
hormone
beta
(
FSHbeta
)
and
luteinizing
hormone
beta
(
LHbeta
)
,
as
well
as
the
pituitary
and
plasma
LH
levels
between
50
and
300
days
post-hatching
(
dph
)
.

Four
gradings
were
conducted
between
2
and
8
months
after
hatching
,
resulting
in
a
population
of
large
and
small
individuals
,
having
96
.
5%
females
(
female-dominant
population
)
and
69
.
2%
males
(
male-dominant
population
)
,
respectively
,
after
the
last
grading
.

The
onset
of
gonadal
differentiation
was
different
in
the
two
sexes
,
and
coincided
with
a
peak
of
expression
of
sbGnRH
or
sGnRH
.

Furthermore
,
the
expression
of
these
GnRHs
was
correlated
with
the
expression
of
dlGnRH-R-2A
.

Sex-related
differences
in
the
brain
and
pituitary
content
of
sbGnRH
were
also
found
at
the
time
of
sexual
differentiation
.

Moreover
,
the
observed
sexual
dimorphism
at
the
transcriptional
or
synthesis
level
of
these
GnRH
forms
suggests
that
a
different
neuro-hormonal
regulation
is
operating
according
to
sex
.

At
the
onset
of
sex
differentiation
,
FSHbeta
transcriptional
activity
reached
maximal
values
,
which
were
maintained
until
the
completion
of
the
process
.

The
present
study
suggests
a
role
for
sbGnRH
,
sGnRH
and
the
dlGnRH-R-2A
during
gonadal
differentiation
,
possibly
through
enhancement
of
FSHbeta
gene
expression
.

In
males
,
a
different
endocrine
regulation
seems
to
exist
also
during
spermiogenesis
and
spermiation
,
when
gene
transcription
,
peptide
synthesis
and
release
of
LH
are
of
greater

Complete
artificial
saliva
(
CAS
)
is
a
saliva
substitute
often
used
as
a
vehicle
for
test
articles
,
including
smokeless
tobacco
products
.

In
the
course
of
a
study
employing
normal
adult
human
dermal
fibroblasts
(
HDFa
)
as
a
model
in
vitro
,
we
discovered
that
CAS
as
a
vehicle
introduced
a
significant
change
in
the
expression
of
proinflammatory
cytokines
.

To
determine
the
effects
of
CAS
on
gene
expression
,
real-time
quantitative
reverse-transcriptase
polymerase
chain
reaction
(
qRT-PCR
)
gene
array
analysis
was
used
.

Results
indicate
that
robust
changes
in
the
expression
of
the
proinflammatory
cytokine
interleukin
8
(
IL8
)
and
the
vascular
cell
adhesion
molecule
1
(
VCAM1
)
occur
within
5
hours
of
exposure
to
CAS
.

To
determine
whether
CAS
also
alters
cytokine
release
into
the
culture
media
,
cytometric
bead
array
(
CBA
)
assays
for
human
inflammatory
cytokines
were
performed
.

Analysis
shows
that
CAS
induced
the
release
of
IL8
and
interleukin
6
(
IL6
)
.

This
study
focused
on
determining
which
components
in
CAS
were
responsible
for
the
proinflammatory
response
in
HDFa
.

The
following
components
were
investigated
:
α-amylase
,
lysozyme
,
acid
phosphatase
,
and
urea
.

Results
demonstrated
that
enzymatically
active
α-amylase
induced
gene
expression
for
proinflammatory
cytokines
IL8
,
IL6
,
tumor
necrosis
factor-α
(
TNFα
)
,
and
interleukin
1α
(

)
,
and
for

.

Therefore
,
it
is
important
to
carefully
evaluate

Imiquimod
is
a
topical
immune

modifier
that
binds
to

.

We
treated
superficial
basal
cell
carcinomas
(
BCC
)
with
imiquimod
5%
cream
daily
for
5-8
days
.

The
BCC
lesions
were
biopsied
before
treatment
and
following
imiquimod
treatment
,
when
the
lesion
showed
the
signs
of
erosion
.

technology
(
Affymetrix
)
to
gain
further
insight
into
the
mode
of

.

Our
findings
demonstrate
that
imiquimod-induced

is
associated
with
a
strong
activity
of
the
innate

FCF
(

quite
often
exceeds
the

(

.

Several

studies
on
SY
are
reported
,
however
immunomodulatory
properties
have
not
been
explored
yet
.

To
investigate
the
immunotoxic
properties
of
SY
,
splenocytes
were
isolated
,
cultured
and
subjected
to
mitogen

assay
(

,
immunophenotypic

surface
receptor
expression
and
assay
for
cytokines
release
in
the
culture
supernatants
were
performed
in
the
presence
of
SY
.

Since
SY
did
not
exhibit
any
cytotoxicity
up
to
250
μg
/
ml
,
this
dose
was
used
for
further
studies
.

It
was
observed
that
SY
(
250
μg
/
ml
)
significantly
(
p<0
.
05
)
suppressed
the
mitogen
induced
proliferation
of
splenocytes
and
MLR
response
.

Further
,
immunophenotypic
analysis
revealed
that
SY
alters
the
relative
expression
of
CD3e
/
CD4
/
CD8
in
T
cells
and
CD19
in
B-cells
.

Consistent
with
the
suppression
of
T-cell
and
B-cell
responses
and
altered
surface
receptor
expression
,
SY
also
lowered
the
expression
of
IL2

we
engineered

Hemorrhagic
cystitis
is
a
common
complication
in
children
receiving
cyclophosphamide
,
a
chemotherapeutic
alkylating
agent
.

Acrolein
is
a
urinary
metabolite
from
cyclophosphamide
and
can
induce
hemorrhagic
cystitis
.

Here
,
we
investigated
the
effects
and
mechanisms
of
acrolein
by
intravesical
instillation
on
urinary
bladder
muscle
contractions
and
pathological
alterations
in
rats
.

Acrolein
instillation
significantly
increased
the
muscle
contractions
of
rat
bladder
detrusor
after
1
and
6
h
but
markedly
decreased
detrusor
contractions
after
24
h
.

Acrolein
increased
phosphorylated
protein
kinase
C
(
pan-PKC
)
expressions
in
bladders
after
1
and
6
h
but
inhibited
it
after
24
h
.

Inducible
nitric

(
NO
)
synthase
(
iNOS
)
protein
expressions
were
markedly
induced
in
bladders
24
h
after
acrolein
treatment
.

Twenty-four-hour
acrolein
instillation
increased
the
levels
of
nitrite
/
nitrate
and
interleukin-6
(
IL-6
)
in
the
urinary
bladder
.

The
iNOS
inhibitors
significantly
inhibited
the
acrolein-increased
nitrite
/
nitrate
levels
,
but
not
IL-6
levels
.

IL-6-neutralizing
antibodies
effectively
inhibited
the
acrolein-increased
NOx
levels
.

The
increased
detrusor
contractions
by
1-h
acrolein
treatment
were
significantly
reversed
by
the
PKC
inhibitor
RO32-0432
,
and
the
decreased
detrusor
contractions
by
24-h
acrolein
treatment
were
significantly
reversed
by
the
iNOS
inhibitor
and
IL-6-neutralizing
antibody
.

Both
the
iNOS
inhibitor
and
IL-6-neutralizing
antibody
effectively
reversed
the
increased
iNOS
expression
,
decreased
PKC
phosphorylation
,
increased

,
and
hemorrhagic

pathway
participates
in
the

OBJECTIVES
:
It
has
been
suggested
that
estrogen
may
improve
endothelial
cell
function
to
delay
the
onset
of
atherosclerosis
in
pre-menopausal
females
,
though
its
mechanism
of
action
is
not
fully
understood
.

We
examined
the
hypothesis
that
human
estrogen
receptor-alpha
(
ER
alpha
)
gene
transfection
improves
the
endothelial
cell
function
.

METHODS
:
A
replication
deficient
adenoviral
vector
was
used
to
transfect
the
ER
alpha
gene
into
bovine
aortic
endothelial
cells
(
BAEC
)
and
a
GFP
gene
containing
vector
was
used
as
control
.

Expression
of
the
eNOS
gene
was
determined
by
Northern
blot
analysis
and
enzyme
activity
assay;
cell
migration
was
assayed
using
a
Transwell
apparatus;
and
tyrosine
phosphorylation
of
FAK
was
estimated
by
Western
blot
analysis
.

RESULTS
:
ER
alpha
gene
transfection
of
endothelial
cells
produced
a
2-3-fold
increase
in
eNOS
mRNA
and
protein
levels
as
well
as
a
significant
increase
(
P
<
0
.
05
)
in
NOS
activity
as
measured
by
citrulline
assay
and
nitrite
accumulation
in
the
media
in
response
to

.

Treatment
of
cells
with
estrogen
blocking
agent
ICI
182780
inhibited
eNOS
induction
in
response
to
ER
alpha
transfection
.

ER
alpha
gene
transfection
significantly
inhibited
(
P
<
0

)
bFGF-induced
chemotactic
migration
of
endothelial
cells
but
increased
cell
attachment

and
type
I
and
IV
collagens
.

ER
alpha
gene
transfer
also
inhibited
bFGF-stimulated
tyrosine
phosphorylation
of
FAK
.

CONCLUSION
:
Our
results
suggest
that
the
atheroprotective
effects
of
estrogen
may
in
part
be
mediated
by
ER
alpha-induced
upregulation
of
eNOS
gene
expression
and
maintenance
of

function
and
integrity

by
multiple
enzymes
,
with
CYP3A4
responsible

(
34%
)
of
metabolism
.

It
is
also
a
substrate
of
P-glycoprotein
(
P-gp
)
in

.

To
assess
the
effect
of
ketoconazole
on
BMS-690514
pharmacokinetics
,
17
healthy
volunteers
received
200
mg
BMS-690514
alone
followed
by
100
mg
BMS-690514
with
ketoconazole
(
400
mg
once
daily
for
4
days
)
.

The
AUC
(
∞
)
of
100
mg
BMS-690514
concomitantly
administered
with
ketoconazole
was
similar
to
that
of
200
mg
BMS-690514
alone
.

The
dose-normalized
C
(
max
)
and
AUC
(
∞
)
of
BMS-690514
from
the
100-mg
BMS-690514
/
400-mg
ketoconazole
treatment
increased
by
55%
and
127%
,
respectively
,
relative
to
those
from
200
mg
BMS-690514
alone
.

Prediction
of
the
drug-drug
interaction
(
DDI
)
using
a
population-based
simulator
(
Simcyp
)
indicated
that
,
in
addition
to
CYP3A4
inhibition
,
the
inhibition
of
P-gp
by
ketoconazole
in
the
intestine
,
liver
,
and
kidneys
must
be
invoked
to
fully
account
for
the
DDI
observed
.

This
finding
suggests
that
the
inhibition
of
P-gp
by
ketoconazole
,
along
with
its
effect
on
CYP3A4
,
needs
to
be
considered
when
designing
a
DDI
study
of
ketoconazole
with
a
victim
drug
that
is
a
dual
substrate

The

technique
for
the
treatment
of
tumors

can
be
reached
by
the

directly
or
by
endoscopic
illumination
)
.

Excellent
results
are
now
obtained
with
hematoporphyrin
derivatives
such
as
Photofrin
II
,
provided
the
concerned
tumors
are
small
and
well
delimited
.

Porphyrins
are
transported
in
blood
mainly
by
lipoproteins
,
and
the
low
density
lipoprotein
(
LDL
)
receptor-mediated
pathway
is
probably
one
of
the
important
factors
involved
in
the
selective
accumulation
of
porphyrins
by
tumor
tissues
,
as
cancer
cells
generally
express
much
more
LDL
receptors
than
normal
cells
.

In
the
present
paper
,
after
a
brief
presentation
of
the
biochemical
basis
of
the
light-dependent
cytotoxicity
of
porphyrins
,
we
shall
examine
the
role
of
lipoproteins
,

LDL
,
in
the
transport
and
the
cellular
uptake
of
these
compounds
.

We

were
examined
in
rat
frontal

Rats
were

for
21
days
with
clozapine
(

)
,
or
haloperidol

Spontaneous

with
a
medium
devoid
of
Mg
(
2
+
)
ions
and
with
added
picrotoxin
(
30
mM
)
.

The
application
of
2-3
microM
8-OH-DPAT
,
acting
through
5-HT
(
1A
)
receptors
,
resulted
in
a
reversible
decrease
of
bursting
frequency
.

In
the
presence
of
1
microM
DOI
,
the
5-HT
(
2
)
agonist
,
or
5
microM
zacopride
,
the
5-HT
(
4
)
agonist
,
bursting
frequency
increased
.

Chronic
clozapine
treatment
resulted
in
an
attenuation
of
the
effect
of
the
activation
of
5-HT
(
2
)
receptors
,
while
the
effects
related
to
5-HT
(
1A
)
and
5-HT
(
4
)
receptor
activation
were
unchanged
.

Treatment
with
haloperiol
did
not
influence
the
reactivity
to
the
activation
of
any
of
the
three
5-HT
receptor
subtypes
.

These
data
are
consistent
with
earlier
findings
demonstrating
a
selective
downregulation
of
5-HT
(
2A
)
receptors
by
clozapine
and
indicate
that
chronic
clozapine
selectively
attenuates
the
5-HT-mediated
excitation
in
neuronal
circuitry
of
the
frontal
cortex
while
leaving
the
5-HT-mediated

but
also
cause

Antofine
,
a
phenanthroindolizidine
alkaloid
derived
from
Cryptocaryachinensis
and
Ficusseptica
in
the
Asclepiadaceae
milkweed
family
,
is
cytotoxic
for
various
cancer
cell
lines
.

In
this
study
,
we
demonstrated
that
treatment
of
rat
primary
astrocytes
with
antofine
induced
dose-dependent
inhibition
of
gap
junction
intercellular
communication
(
GJIC
)
,
as
assessed
by
scrape-loading
6-carboxyfluorescein
dye
transfer
.

Levels
of
Cx43
protein
were
also
decreased
in
a
dose-
and
time-dependent
manner
following
antofine
treatment
.

Double-labeling
immunofluorescence
microscopy
showed
that
antofine
(
10ng
/
ml
)
induced
endocytosis
of
surface
gap
junctions
into
the
cytoplasm
,
where
Cx43
was
co-localized
with
the
early
endosome
marker
EEA1
.

Inhibition
of
lysosomes
or
proteasomes
by
co-treatment
with
antofine
and
their
respective
specific
inhibitors
,
NH4Cl
or
MG132
,
partially
inhibited
the
antofine-induced
decrease
in
Cx43
protein
levels
,
but
did
not
inhibit
the
antofine-induced
inhibition
of
GJIC
.

After
30min
of
treatment
,
antofine
induced
a
rapid
increase
in
the
intracellular
Ca
(
2
+
)
concentration
and
activation
of
protein
kinase
C
(
PKC
)
α
/
βII
,
which
was
maintained
for
at
least
6h
.

Co-treatment
of
astrocytes
with
antofine
and
the
intracellular
Ca
(
2
+
)
chelator
BAPTA-AM
prevented
downregulation
of
Cx43
and
inhibition
of
GJIC
.

Moreover
,
co-treatment
with
antofine
and
a
specific
PKCβ
inhibitor
prevented
endocytosis
of
gap
junctions
,
downregulation
of
Cx43
,
and
inhibition
of
GJIC
.

Taken
together
,
these
findings
indicate
that
antofine
induces
Cx43
gap
junction
disassembly
by
the
PKCβ
signaling
pathway
.

Despite

the

by
which

enzymes
promote
homolytic
cleavage
of
the
cofactor's
Co-C
bond
to
initiate
catalysis
has
continued
to
elude
researchers
.

In
this
work
,
we
utilized
magnetic
circular

to
explore
how
the
electronic
structure
of
the
reduced
B12
cofactor
(
i

,
the
post-homolysis
product

)
is
modulated
by
the
enzyme
methylmalonyl-CoA

.

Our

reveal
a
fairly
uniform
stabilization
of
the

,
even
in

.

Collectively
,
these
observations
provide
direct
evidence
that

activation
involves
stabilization
of
the

on

Incubation

,
and
gestational

binding
to
partially
purified

)
.

Blood
pressure
was
significantly
elevated
in
PE
and
GH
subjects
as
compared
with
controls
.

Insulin
binding
was
similar
in
number
and
affinity
in
the
three
groups
(
femtomoles

)
.

IGF-I

was
increased

Insulin

with
normals
when
assessed
either
per
microgram
protein
or
per
femtomole

(

.

In
contrast
,
IGF-I-potentiated
TKA
was
elevated
in
PE
subjects
only
when
assessed
per
microgram

(
P

.

Thus
,
the
increased
number
of
IGF-I
receptors
in
erythrocytes
of
PE
subjects
yields
a
net
increase
in
receptor
tyrosine
kinase
.

Also
,
there
is
an
augmentation
of
insulin

these

Immunoblotting

subunits
could
all
be
found
in
the
human
spinal

preferentially
located

Immunoprecipitation
of
solubilized
receptors
revealed
that
NR1
,
NR2C
,
and
NR2D
subunits
coprecipitated
with
the
NR2A
subunit

indicating
that
native
human
spinal

are
heteroligimeric

by
at

Mastocytosis
is
associated
with
an
activating
mutation
in
the
KIT
oncoprotein
(
KITD816V
)
that
results
in
autophosphorylation
of
the
KIT
receptor
in
a
ligand-independent
manner
.

This
mutation
is
inherently
resistant
to
imatinib
and
,
to
date
,
there
remains
no
effective
curative
therapy
for
systemic
mastocytosis
associated

KITD816V
.

Dasatinib
(
BMS-354825
)
is
a
novel
orally
bioavailable
SRC
/
ABL
inhibitor
that
has
activity
against
multiple
imatinib-resistant
BCR-ABL
isoforms
in
vitro
that
is
presently
showing
considerable
promise
in
early-phase
clinical
trials
of
chronic
myeloid
leukemia
(
CML
)
.

Pharmacokinetic
analysis
suggests
that
high
nanomolar
concentrations
of
dasatinib
can
be
achieved
safely
in
humans
.

In
this
study
,
we
demonstrate
significant
inhibitory
activity
of
dasatinib
against
both
wild-type
KIT
and
the
KITD816V
mutation
in
the
nanomolar
range
in
in
vitro
and
cell-based
kinase
assays
.

Additionally
,
dasatinib
leads
to
growth
inhibition
of
a
KITD816V-harboring
human
masto-cytosis
cell
line
.

Significantly
,
dasatinib
selectively
kills
primary
neoplastic
bone
marrow
mast
cells
from
patients
with
systemic
mastocytosis
while
sparing
other
hematopoietic
cells
.

Computer
modeling
suggests
that
the
KITD816V
mutation
destabilizes
the
inactive
conformation
of
the
KIT
activation
loop
to
which
imatinib
binds
,
but
it
is
not
predicted
to
impair
binding
of
KIT
by
dasatinib
.

Based
upon
our
results
,
further
evaluation
of
dasatinib
for
the
treatment
of
systemic
masto-cytosis
in
clinical
trials
is
warranted
.

Moreover
,
dasatinib
may
be
of
clinical
utility
in
other
disease
settings
driven
by
activating
KIT
mutations

Clinical

the
Brugada

The
pregnane
X
receptor
(
PXR
)
is
a
key
xenobiotic
receptor
that
regulates
the
expression
of
numerous
drug-metabolizing
enzymes
.

Some
posttranslational
mechanisms
modulate
its
transcriptional
activity
.

Although
several
kinases
have
been
shown
to
directly
phosphorylate
this
receptor
,
little
is
known
about
phosphorylation
sites
of
PXR
.

In
the
present
work
,
we
examined
T248
,
Y249
and
T422
putative
phosphorylation
sites
determined
based
on
in
silico
consensus
kinase
site
prediction
analysis
.

T248
and
T422
residues
are
critical
for
the
interaction
of
the
PXR
ligand-binding
domain
and
the
activation
function-2
(
AF2
)
domain
.

Site-directed
mutagenesis
analysis
was
performed
to
generate
phospho-deficient
and
phospho-mimetic
mutants
.

We
examined
transactivation

of
the
PXR
mutants
in

gene
response
element

and
CYP3A4
expression
in
HepG2
cells
after

of
the
mutants
.

We
found
that
T248D
mutant
activated
CYP3A4
transactivation
constitutively
regardless
of
the
presence
or
absence
of
a
ligand
.

Contrary
,
T248V
mutant
exhibited
low
basal
and
ligand-inducible
transactivation
capacity
as
compared
to
wild-type
PXR
.

Dose-response
analysis
revealed
reduced
ligand-dependent
transactivation
potency
of
PXR
Y249D
mutant
.

Transactivation
of
the
CYP3A4
promoter
was
abolished
with
T422A
/
D
mutants
.

All
PXR
mutants
formed
heterodimer
with
RXRα
at
a
similar
level
to
that
observed
with
wild-type
PXR
.

The
ability
to
bind
to
DNA
in
vitro
was
substantially
decreased
in
case
of
T248D
,
T422D
and
T248V
mutants
.

Our
data
thus
indicate
that
phosphorylation
of
T248
,
Y249
and
T422
residues
may
be
critical
for
the
both
basal
and
ligand-activated
function
of
PXR
.

was
significantly
lower

The

Prostaglandin

suppressed

1
and
CD40
expression
,
but
prostaglandin
E2
did
not
effect
on
any

Both

,
ONO-AE1-329
,
a

inhibited

Moreover
,
anti-B7
.
1
and
anti-CD40
Abs
prevented
lipopolysaccharide-induced
TNF-alpha
production
and
T-cell
proliferation
.

Therefore
,
the
effect
of
prostaglandin

might
depend
on
the
inhibition
of
B7

,
but
that
of

In
conclusion
,
the
mechanism
responsible
for
the

is
distinct
from
that

Layer-by-layer
(

assembly
is
an
attractive
platform
for
controlled
release
of
biologics
given
its
mild
fabrication
process
and
versatility
in
coating
substrates
of
any
shape
.

Proteins
can
be
incorporated
into
LBL
coatings
by
sequentially
depositing
oppositely
charged
polyelectrolytes
,
which
self-assemble
into
nanoscale
films
on
medical
devices
or
tissue
engineering
scaffolds
.

However
,
previously
reported
LBL
platforms
often
require
the
use
of
a
few
hundred
layers
to
avoid
burst
release
,
which
hinders
their
broad
translation
due
to
the
lengthy
fabrication
process
,
cost
,
and
batch-to-batch
variability
.

Here
we
report
a
biodegradable
LBL
platform
composed
of
only
10
layers
with
tunable
protein
release
kinetics
,
which
is
an
order
of
magnitude
less
than
previously
reported
LBL
platforms
.

We
performed
a

to
examine
the

may
be
used
for

Organophosphate
(

)
pesticides
are
neurotoxic
compounds
that
are
widely

.

Classical
methods
for
monitoring
OP
exposure
comprise
the
measurement
of
intact
OP
,
its
metabolites
or
cholinesterase
activity
.

Newly
developed
methods
focus
on
the
analysis
of
the
OP
adduct
bound
to
proteins
such
as
butyrylcholinesterase
(
BuChE
)
and
albumin
.

These
adducts
can
be
analyzed
by

of
fluoride
reactivation

by
analysis
with
LC-MS
/
MS
of
the
pepsin
or
pronase

.

The
utility
of
these
methods
is
illustrated
through
the

obtained
from
patients
taken
1-49days
after

Thus
,
in

several

all
pointing
to
the

exposure

Background
:
Epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition
(
EMT
)
has
been
thought
to
play
a
critical
role
in
invasion
and
metastasis
of
cancer
and
to
be
associated
with
cancer
stem
cell
(
CSC
)
properties
.

It
is
not
clear
if
there
is
a
link
between
EMT
and
CSCs
in
thyroid
cancers
.

We
therefore
investigated
CSC
properties
of
thyroid
cancers
that
underwent
EMT
.

Method
:
To
induce
EMT
(
spindle-like
cell
morphology
,
loss
and
acquisition
of
expression
of
an
epithelial
marker
E-cadherin
and
a
mesenchymal
marker

,
respectively
)
in
an
epithelial
type
thyroid
cancer
cell
line
ACT-1
,
we
used
transforming
growth
factor-beta
(
TGF-beta
)
,
BRAFV600E
and
/
or
Snail
homolog
1
(
SNAI1
,
also
known
as
SNAIL
)
.

CSC
properties
were
analyzed
with
assays
for
cell
proliferation
,
chemosensitivity
,
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
tumor
formation
ability
,
cell
surface
antigens
and
intracellular
aldehyde
dehydrogenase
(
ALDH;
a
known
CSC
marker
)
activities
.

Results
:
EMT
was
induced
most
efficiently
by
SNAIL
(
ACT-SNAIL
cells
)
,
whereas
TGF-beta
and
BRAFV600E
were
less
efficient
.

ACT-SNAIL
cells
showed
slightly
but
significantly
enhanced
tumor
formation
ability
in
in
vitro
sphere
assay
(
~3
fold
)
but
not
in
vivo
subcutaneous
tumor
growth
assay
,
and
showed
comparable
chemosensitivity
,
as
compared
to
the
parental
ACT-1
cells
.

However
,
of
interest
,
although
in
vitro
sphere
formation
ability
of
ALDH
+
cells
was
almost
unchanged
after
SNAIL
induction
,
SNAIL
overexpression
induced
much
higher
(
~14
fold
)
spheres
in
ALDH-
cells
.

Thus
,
ALDH
was
no
longer
a
CSC
marker
in
ACT-SNAIL
cells
.

Conclusions
:
All
these
data
indicate
that
EMT
confers
CSC
properties
in
ALDH-
cells
and
appears
to
influence
the
ability
of
ALDH
to
enrich
CSCs
.

the

of
P-selectin
and
the

of

,
while
the
two

had
a

.

Platelet
fibrinogen

and
PMN
activation
markers
(
fibrinogen

were

The
greater
effect
of
parnaparin
,
as
compared
to
the
reference

,
could
be
due

chemico-physical
differences

OBJECTIVE
:
Ziprasidone
is
an
atypical
antipsychotic
drug
that
shows
a
higher
affinity
for
serotonin
5-HT
(
2
)
receptors
compared
with
dopamine
D
(
2
)
receptors
in

.

The
affinity
of
ziprasidone
for
these
receptors
in
vivo
in
patients
was
examined
in
a
positron
emission
tomography
(
PET
)
study
.

METHOD
:
The
authors
conducted
a
PET
study
to
evaluate
D
(
2
)
occupancy
(
using
[
(
11
)
C
]
raclopride
)
and
5-HT
(

)
occupancy
(

]
setoperone
)
in
brain
regions
of

16
patients
with
schizophrenia
or
schizoaffective
disorder
randomly
assigned
to
receive
40
,
80
,
120
,
or
160
mg
/
day
of
ziprasidone
,
which
reflected
the
recommended
dose
range
.

PET
scanning
was
done
after
3
weeks
of
administration
and
at
trough
plasma
levels
,
i
.

e
.

,
12-16
hours
after
the
last
dose
.

RESULTS
:
The
mean
5-HT
(
2
)
receptor
occupancy
was
significantly
higher
than
the
mean
D
(
2
)
receptor
occupancy
(
mean
=
76%
,
SD
=
15%
,
and
mean
=
56%
,
SD
=
18%
,
respectively
)
.

The
estimated
plasma
ziprasidone
concentration
associated
with
50%
maximal
5-HT
(
2
)
receptor
occupancy
was
almost
four
times
lower
than
that
for
D
(
2
)
receptor
occupancy
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
These
data
affirm
that
ziprasidone
is
similar
to
other
novel
antipsychotics
in
having
greater
5-HT
(
2
)
than
D
(
2
)
receptor
occupancy
at
therapeutic
doses
and
suggest
that
the
optimal
effective
dose
of
ziprasidone
is
closer
to
120
mg
/
day
than
to
the
lower
doses
suggested
by
previous
PET
studies
.

The
relatively
high
D
(
2
)
receptor
occupancy
,
even
at
trough
plasma
levels
,
suggests
that
ziprasidone
is
more
similar
to
risperidone
and
olanzapine
in
receptor
occupancy
profile
than
to
clozapine
and
quetiapine
.

Since
ziprasidone
plasma
levels
show
significant
(
more
than
twofold
)
variation
within
a
single
dose
cycle
,
studies
that
are
aimed
at
peak
plasma
levels
(
6
hours
after
the
last
dose
)
and
that
examine
extrastriatal
regions
are
required
to
fully
characterize
the
in

occupancy
profile
of
ziprasidone

There

All

As
PFOA
,
being
a
well-known
peroxisome

,
the

PFCA
tested
in
this

were
also
shown
to
activate

PFOA
having

of
PPARα
activation
.

Moreover

showed
weak
potential
to
activate
PPARγ

Taken

,
the

revealed
that
PFCA

to
be
less

Interleukin
(
IL
)
-11
is
a
multifunctional
cytokine
whose
role
in
osteoclast
development
has
not
been
fully
elucidated
.

We
examined
IL-11
production
by
primary
osteoblasts
and
the
effects
of
rat
monoclonal
anti-mouse
glycoprotein
130
(
gp130
)
antibody
on
osteoclast
formation
,
using
a
coculture
of
mouse
osteoblasts
and
bone
marrow
cells
.

IL-1

and

,
25-dihydroxyvitamin

alpha
,
25
(

)
similarly
induced
production
of
IL-11
by
osteoblasts
,
but
IL-6
,
IL-4
,
and
TGF
beta
did
not
.

Primary
osteoblasts
constitutively
expressed
mRNAs
for
both
IL-11
receptor
(
IL-11R
alpha
)
and
gp130
.

Osteotropic
factors
did
not
modulate
IL-11R
alpha
mRNA
at
24
h
,
but
steady-state
gp130
mRNA
expression
in
osteoblasts
was
upregulated
by
1
alpha
,
25
(
OH
)
2D3
,
PTH
,
or
IL-1
.

In
cocultures
,
the
formation
of
multinucleated
osteoclast-like
cells
(
OCLs
)
in
response
to
IL-11
,
or
IL-6
together
with
its
soluble
IL-6
receptor
was
dose-dependently
inhibited
by
rat
monoclonal
anti-mouse
gp130
antibody
.

Furthermore
,
adding
anti-gp130
antibody
abolished
OCL
formation
induced
by
IL-1
,
and
partially
inhibited
OCL
formation
induced
by
PGE2
,
PTH
,
or
1
alpha
,
25
(
OH
)
2D3
.

During
osteoclast
formation
in
marrow
cultures
,
a
sequential
relationship
existed
between
the
expression
of
calcitonin
receptor
mRNA
and
IL-11R
alpha
mRNA
.

Osteoblasts
as
well
as
OCLs
expressed
transcripts
for
IL-11R
alpha
,
as
indicated
by
RT-PCR
analysis
and
in
situ
hybridization
.

These
results
suggest
a
central
role
of
gp130-coupled
cytokines
,
especially
IL-11
,
in
osteoclast
development
.

Since
osteoblasts
and
mature
osteoclasts
expressed
IL-11R
alpha
mRNA
,
both
bone-forming
and
bone-resorbing
cells
are
potential
targets
of
IL-11
.

Non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory
drugs
(
NSAIDs
)
are
competitive
inhibitors
of
cyclooxygenase
(
COX
)
,
the
enzyme
that
mediates
biosynthesis
of
prostaglandins
and
thromboxanes
from
arachidonic
acid
.

There
are
at
least
two
different
isoforms
of
the
enzyme
known
as
COX-1
and
-2
.

Site
directed
mutagenesis
studies
suggest
that
non-selective
COX
inhibitors
of
diverse
chemical
families
exhibit
differential
binding
modes
to
the
two
isozymes
.

These
results
cannot
clearly
be
explained
from
the
sole
analysis
of
the
crystal
structures
of
COX
available
from
X-ray

With
the
aim
to
elucidate
the
structural
features
governing
the
differential
inhibitory
binding
behavior
of
these
inhibitors
,
molecular
modeling
studies
were
undertaken
to
generate

Accordingly

were
undertaken
using

The
results

provide
new
insights
into
a
better
understanding
of
the
differential

The
secretagogue
5-hydroxytryptamine
(
5-HT
)
is
implicated
in
the
pathophysiology
of
cholera
.

5-HT
released
from
enterochromaffin
cells
after
cholera
toxin
exposure
is
thought
to
activate
non-neuronally
(
5-HT
(
2
)
dependent
)
and
neuronally
(
5-HT
(
3
)
dependent
)
mediated
water
and
electrolyte
secretion
.

CT-secretion
can
be
reduced
by
preventing
the
release
of
5-HT
.

Enterochromaffin
cells
possess
numerous
receptors
that
,
under
basal
conditions
,
modulate
5-HT
release
.

2
.

These
include
basolateral
5-HT
(
3
)
receptors
,
the
activation
of
which
is
known
to
enhance
5-HT
release
.

3
.

Until
now
,
5-HT
(
3
)
receptor
antagonists
(
e
.

g
.

granisetron
)
have
been
thought
to
inhibit
cholera
toxin-induced
fluid
secretion
by
blockading
5-HT
(
3
)
receptors
on
secretory
enteric
neurones
.

Instead
we
postulated
that
they
act
by
inhibiting
cholera
toxin-induced
enterochromaffin
cell
degranulation
.

were

of

.

Net
fluid
movement
was
determined
by
small

perfusion
or
gravimetry
and
small
intestinal
and
luminal
fluid
5-HT
levels
were
determined
by
HPLC
with
fluorimetric
detection
.

5
.

Intraluminal
5-HT
release
was
proportional
to
the
reduction
in
tissue
5-HT
levels
and
to
the
onset
of
water
and
electrolyte
secretion
,
suggesting
that
luminal
5-HT
levels
reflect
enterochromaffin
cell
activity
.

6
.

Both
lidocaine
and
granisetron
inhibited
fluid
secretion
.

However
,
granisetron
alone
,
and
proportionately
,
reduced
5-HT
release
.

7
.

The
simultaneous
inhibition
of
5-HT
release
and
fluid
secretion
by
granisetron
suggests
that
5-HT
release
from
enterochromaffin
cells
is
potentiated
by
endogenous
5-HT
(
3
)
receptors
.

The
accentuated
5-HT
release
promotes
cholera

secretion

is
used
clinically
for

There
is

In

describe
the

Among
the
TEM-type

beta-lactamases
(
ESBLs
)
,
an
amino
acid
change
at
Ambler
position
104
(
Glu

)
results
in
increased
resistance
to
ceftazidime
and
cefotaxime
when
found
with
other
substitutions
(

,
Gly238Ser
and
Arg164Ser
)
.

To
examine
the
role
of
Asp104
in
SHV
beta-lactamases
,
site
saturation
mutagenesis
was
performed
.

Our
goal
was
to
investigate
the
properties
of
amino
acid
residues
at
this
position
that
affect
resistance
to
penicillins
and
oxyimino-cephalosporins
.

Unexpectedly
,
58%
of
amino
acid
variants
at
position
104
in
SHV
expressed
in
Escherichia
coli
DH10B
resulted
in
beta-lactamases
with
lowered
resistance
to
ampicillin
.

In
contrast
,
increased
resistance
to
cefotaxime
was
demonstrated
only
for
the
Asp104Arg
and
Asp104Lys
beta-lactamases
.

When
all
19
substitutions
were
introduced
into
the
SHV-2
(
Gly238Ser
)
ESBL
,
the
most
significant
increases
in
cefotaxime
and
ceftazidime
resistance
were
noted
for
both
the
doubly
substituted
Asp104Lys
Gly238Ser
and
the
doubly
substituted
Asp104Arg
Gly238Ser
beta-lactamases
.

Correspondingly
,
the
overall
catalytic

(

for

was
increased
from

.

We
also
showed
that
(
i
)
k3
was
the
rate-limiting
step
for
the
hydrolysis
of
cefotaxime
by
Asp104Lys
,
(

)
the
Km
for
cefotaxime
of
the
doubly
substituted
Asp104Lys
Gly238Ser
variant
approached
that
of
the
Gly238Ser
beta-lactamase
as
pH
increased
,
and
(

)
Lys
at
position
104
functions
in
an
energetically
additive
manner
with
the
Gly238Ser
substitution
to
enhance
catalysis
of
cephalothin
.

Based
on
this
analysis
,
we
propose
that
the
amino
acid
at
Ambler
position
104
in
SHV-1
beta-lactamase
plays
a
major
role
in
substrate
binding
and
recognition
of

influences

Transcription
factor
p63
,
a
member
of
the
p53
family
,
shares
a
high
degree
of
sequence
similarity
with
p53
.

Because
of
transcription
from
two
distinct
promoters
,
the
p63
gene
encodes
two
isoforms
,
TAp63
and
ΔNp63
.

Although
TAp63
acts
as
a
tumor
suppressor
,
ΔNp63
functions
as
an
oncogene
and
is
often
overexpressed
in
squamous
cell
carcinomas
.

Thus
,
therapeutic
agents
targeting
ΔNp63
might
be
used
to
manage
tumors
that
overexpress
ΔNp63
.

Here
we
found
that
arsenic
trioxide
,
a
frontline
agent
for
acute
promyelocytic
leukemia
,
inhibits
ΔNp63
but
not
TAp63
expression
in
time-
and
dose-dependent
manners
.

In
addition
,
we
found
that
arsenic
trioxide
decreases
the
stability
of
ΔNp63
protein
via
a
proteasome-dependent
pathway
but
has
little
effect
on
the
level
of

transcript
.

Furthermore
,
we
found
that
arsenic
trioxide
activates
the
Pirh2
promoter
and
consequently
induces
Pirh2
expression
.

Consistent
with
this
,
we
found
that
knockdown
of
Pirh2
inhibits
,
whereas
ectopic
expression
of
Pirh2
enhances
,
arsenic-induced
degradation
of
ΔNp63
protein
.

Importantly
,
we
found
that
knockdown
of
ΔNp63
sensitizes
,
whereas
ectopic
expression
of
ΔNp63
inhibits
,
growth
suppression
induced
by
arsenic
.

Together
,
these
data
suggest
that
arsenic
degrades
ΔNp63
protein
at
least
in
part
via
Pirh2-dependent
proteolysis
and
that
inhibition
of
ΔNp63
expression
facilitates
tumor
cells
to
arsenic-induced
death
.

Smoothened
(
Smo
)
is
a
7-transmembrane
protein
essential
to
the
activation
of
Gli
transcription
factors
(
Gli
)
by
hedgehog
morphogens
.

The
structure
of
Smo
implies
interactions
with
heterotrimeric
G
proteins
,
but
the
degree
to
which
G
proteins
participate
in
the
actions
of
hedgehogs
remains
controversial
.

We
posit
that
the
G
(
i
)
family
of
G
proteins
provides
to
hedgehogs
the
ability
to
expand
well
beyond
the
bounds
of
Gli
.

In
this
regard
,
we
evaluate
here
the
efficacy
of
Smo
as
it
relates
to
the
activation
of
G
(
i
)
,
by
comparing
Smo
with
the
5-hydroxytryptamine
(
1A
)
(
5-HT
(
1A
)
)
receptor
,
a
quintessential
G
(
i
)
-coupled
receptor
.

We
find
that
with
use
of
[

]
guanosine
5'-
(
3-O-thio
)
triphosphate
,

)
endogenous
to
human
embryonic
kidney
(
HEK
)
-293
cells
made
to
express
epitope-tagged
receptors
and
,
second
,
with
individual
forms
of
Gα
(
i
)
fused
to
the
C
terminus
of
each
receptor
,
Smo
is
equivalent
to
the
5-HT
(
1A
)
receptor
in
the
assay
as
it
relates
to
capacity
to
activate
G
(
i
)
.

This
finding
is
true
regardless
of
subtype
of
G
(

)
(

,
G
(
i2
)
,
G

We
also
find
that
Smo
endogenous
to
HEK-293
cells
,
ostensibly
through
inhibition
of
adenylyl
cyclase
,
decreases
intracellular
levels
of
cAMP
.

The
results
indicate
that
Smo
is
a
receptor
that
can
engage
not

Gli

also
other
more

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL
RELEVANCE
:
Licorice
(
Glycyrrhiza
uralensis
Fisch
.

,
Leguminosae
)
has
been
used
in
herbal
medicine
and
food
supplement
worldwide
for
centuries
.

Licorice
is
a
common
ingredient
of
several
prescriptions
of
traditional
Chinese
medicine
which
have
been
proved
to
inhibit
infection
of
human
respiratory
syncytial
virus
(
HRSV
)
.

There
are
two
preparations
of
licorice
,
Radix
Glycyrrhizae
and
Radix
Glycyrrhizae
Preparata
.

However
,
it
is
unknown
whether
licorice
or
which
preparation
of
licorice
is
effective
against
HRSV
,
nor
is
its
active
constituent
.

AIM
OF
THE
STUDY
:
We
tested
the
hypothesis
that
Radix
Glycyrrhizae
can
effectively
decrease
HRSV-induced
plaque
formation
in
respiratory
mucosal
cell
lines
.

We
also
tried
to
find
out
the
active
constituent
.

MATERIALS
AND
METHODS
:
Anti-HRSV
activities
of
hot
water
extracts
of
preparations
of
licorice
,
glycyrrhizin
and
18β-glycyrrhetinic
acid
(
18β-GA
)
,
the
active
constituents
of
licorice
,
were
examined
by
plaque
reduction
assay
in
both
human
upper
(
HEp-2
)
and
low
(
A549
)
respiratory
tract
cell
lines
.

Abilities
of
crude
licorice
to
inhibit
viral
replication
and
to
stimulate
IFN-β
were
evaluated
by
reverse
transcription
polymerase
chain
reaction
(
RT-PCR
)
and
enzyme-linked
immunosorbent
assay
(
ELISA
)
,
respectively
.

RESULTS
:
Radix
Glycyrrhizae
and
Radix
Glycyrrhizae
Preparata
dose-dependently
inhibited
HRSV-induced
plaque
formation
in
both
HEp-2
and
A549
cell
lines
(
p<0
.
0001
)
.

The
effect
of
Radix
Glycyrrhizae
was
better
than
that
of
Radix
Glycyrrhizae
Preparata
on
HEp-2
cells
.

However
,
there
was
no
difference
of
their
anti-HRSV
effects
on
A549
cells
.

Besides
,
glycyrrhizin
was
ineffective
at
all
.

Nevertheless
,
18β-GA
showed
a
potent
anti-HRSV
activity
.

Radix
Glycyrrhizae
was
more
effective
when
given
before
viral
inoculation
(
p<0
.
0001
)
which
may
be
due
to
its
inhibition
of
viral
attachment
on
(
p<0
.
0001
)
and
penetration
(
p<0
.
0001
)
into
the
host
cells
.

The
anti-HRSV
activity
of
Radix
Glycyrrhizae
was
further
confirmed
by
RT-PCR
and
qRT-PCR
.

300μg
/
ml
Radix
Glycyrrhizae
markedly
decreased
the
viral
amounts
within
the
cells
and
in
the
suspension
.

Radix
Glycyrrhizae
might
further
stimulate
mucosal
cells
to
secrete
IFN-β
to
counteract
viral
infection
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
Both
Radix
Glycyrrhizae
and
Radix
Glycyrrhizae
Preparata
are
effective
against
HRSV
infection
on
airway
epithelial
cells
.

Radix
Glycyrrhizae
inhibited
HRSV
mainly
by
preventing
viral
attachment
,
internalization
,
and
by
stimulating
IFN
secretion
.

18β-GA
may
be
one
of
its
active
constituents

Oxymatrine
(
OMT
)
is
a
major
bioactive
component
derived
from
Sophora

Ait
(
kushen
)
,
which
is
widely
used
in
Chinese

.

Recent
studies
have
shown
that
it
has
neuroprotective
effects;
however
,
its
underlying
mechanisms
remain
unclear
.

We
focus
on
the
mechanisms
of
pharmacologic
action
in
OMT
by
detecting
its
pharmacological
properties
against
focal
cerebral
ischemia
in
vivo
and
NMDA-induced
neurotoxicity
in
vitro
.

OMT
prevented
cerebral
ischemic
injury
in
mice
induced
via
a
2
h
middle
cerebral
artery
occlusion
and
a
24
h
reperfusion
,
in
vivo
.

In
vitro
cultured
neurons
challenged
with
N-methyl-D-aspartate
(
NMDA
,
200
μM
)
for
30
min
showed
significant
decrease
in
the
viability
of
neurons;
however
,
OMT
was
able
to
protect
neurons
against
induced
neurotoxicity
via
NMDA
exposure
.

Western
blot
analysis
revealed
that
OMT
decreased
the
expression
of
Bax
and
repaired
the
balance
of
pro-
and
anti-apoptotic
proteins
.

Furthermore
,
OMT
significantly
reversed
the
up-regulation
of
NR2B
and
inhibited
the
calcium
overload
in
the
cultured
neurons
after
challenging
the
NMDA
.

OMT
showed
partial
protection
in
the
cortical
neurons
via
down-regulation
of
NR2B
containing
NMDA
receptors
and
up-regulation
of
Bcl-2
family
.

results

insights
into

Translational
research
is
needed
to
discover
pharmacological
targets
and
treatments
for
the
diagnostic
behavioral
domains
of
autism
spectrum
disorders
.

Animal
models
with
phenotypic
relevance
to
diagnostic
criteria
offer
clear
experimental
strategies
to
test
the
efficacy
and
safety
of
novel
treatments
.

Antagonists
of
mGluR5
receptors
are
in
clinical
trials
for
Fragile
X
syndrome
and
under
investigation
for
the
treatment
of
autism
spectrum
disorders
.

However
,
in
preclinical
studies
of
mGluR5
compounds
tested
in
our
laboratory
and
others
,
increased
locomotion
following
mGluR5
modulation
has
been
observed
.

Understanding
the
influence
of
general
activity
on
sociability
and
repetitive
behaviors
will
increase
the
accuracy
of
interpretations
of
positive
outcomes
measured
from
pharmacological
treatment
that
produces
locomotor
activating
or
sedating
effects
.

In
the
present
studies
,
dose-response
curves
for
d-amphetamine
(
AMPH
)
-induced
hyperlocomotion
were
similar
in
standard
B6
mice
and
in
the
BTBR
mouse
model
of
autism
.

AMPH
produced
significant
,
robust
reductions
in
the
high
level
of
repetitive
self-grooming
that
characterizes
BTBR
,
and
also
reduced
the
low
baseline
grooming
in
B6
,
indicating
that
AMPH-induced
hyperlocomotion
competes
with
time
spent
engaged
in
self-grooming
.

We
then
tested
AMPH
in
B6
and
BTBR
on
the
3-chambered
social
approach
task
.

One
component
of
sociability
,
the
time
spent
in
the
chamber
with
the
novel
mouse
,
in
B6
mice
was
reduced
,
while
the
sniffing
time
component
of
sociability
in
BTBR
mice
was
enhanced
.

This
finding
replicated
across
multiple
cohorts
treated
with
AMPH
and
saline
vehicle
.

In-depth
analysis
revealed
that
AMPH
increased
the
number
and
decreased
the
duration
of
sniffing
bouts
in
BTBR
,
suggesting
BTBR
treated
with
AMPH
mostly
engaged
in
brief
sniffs
rather
than
true
social
interactions
with
the
novel
mouse
during
the
social
approach
task
.

Our
data
suggest
that
compounds
with
stimulant
properties
may
have
some
direct
benefits
on
reducing
repetitive
behaviors
in
autism
spectrum
disorders
,
particularly
in
the
subset
of
autistic
individuals
with
hyperactivity

Pulsatilla
koreana
has
been
used
as
a
traditional
medicine
for
the
treatment
of
several
diseases
.

The
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
determine
if
SB365
,
Pulsatilla
saponin
D
isolated
from
the
root
of
P
.

koreana
inhibits
the
progression
of
colon
cancer
.

We
found
that
SB365
strongly
suppressed
the
growth
and
proliferation
of
colon
cancer
cells
and
induced
their
apoptosis
.

Also
,
SB365
showed
anti-angiogenic
activity
by
decreasing
the
expression
of
HIF-1α
and
VEGF
.

These
results
were
confirmed
by
an
in
vivo
study
showing
that
SB365
significantly
inhibited
tumor
growth
by
the
induction
of
apoptosis
and
inhibition
of
angiogenesis
with
stronger
anticancer
activity
than
5-FU
.

When
further
examined
for
its
anticancer
mechanism
,
SB365
effectively
suppressed
the
AKT
/
mTOR
pathway
both
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
.

Taken
together
,
our
study
demonstrated
that
SB365
inhibits
the
AKT
/
mTOR
pathway
,
leading
to
the
suppression
of
tumor
growth
and
angiogenesis
together
with
induction
of
apoptosis
.

Therefore
,
SB365
is
a
good
candidate
as
a
natural
product
for
use
in
the
treatment
of
colon
cancer
.
Insulin

is
often
required
to
achieve
good
glycemic
control
for
the
patients
with

)
,
while
protraction
of

may
be
preferable
for

The
present
study
was
performed
on
928
patients

compared
between

and
those
who
continued
with
insulin
.

Of
the
928
patients
,
37
had
stopped
insulin
therapy
within
1
year
.

In
the
patients
who
stopped
insulin
therapy
,
the
duration
of
diabetes
was
significantly
shorter
and
the
daily
insulin
dosage
at
initiation
and
the
prevalence
of
sulfonylurea
pretreatment
significantly
lower
compared
with
patients
who
continued
on
insulin
.

In
conclusion
,
almost
4%
of
T2DM
patients
were
able
to
stop
insulin
therapy
with
satisfactory
glycemic
control
in
a
real
clinical
practice
setting
in
Japan
.

Shorter
duration
of
diabetes
and

of
sulfonylureas
prior
to
insulin
may
associate
with
stopping

MicroRNAs
are
involved
in
regulating
the
biology
of
cancer
cells
,
but
their
involvement
in
chemoresistance
is
not
fully
understood
.

We
found
that
miR-663
was
up-regulated
in
our
induced
multidrug-resistant
MDA-MB-231
/
ADM
cell
line
and
that
this
up-regulation
was
closely
related
to
chemosensitivity
.

In
the
present
study
,
we
aimed
to
clarify
the
role
of
miR-663
in
regulating
the
chemoresistance
of
breast
cancer
.

MicroRNA
microarray
and
quantitative
RT-PCR
assays
were
used
to
identify
differentially
expressed
microRNAs
.

Cell
apoptosis
was
evaluated
by
annexin
V
/
propidium
iodide
staining
,
TUNEL
,
and
reactive
oxygen
species
generation
analysis
.

The
expression
of
miR-663
and
HSPG2
in
breast
cancer
tissues
was
detected
by
in
situ
hybridization
and
immunohistochemistry
.

The
potential
targets
of
miR-663
were
defined
by
a
luciferase
reporter
assay
.

Bisulfite
sequencing
PCR
was
used
to
analyze
the
methylation
status
.

We
found
that
miR-663
was
significantly
elevated
in
MDA-MB-231
/
ADM
cells
,
and
the
down-regulation
of
miR-663
sensitized
MDA-MB-231
/
ADM
cells
to
both
cyclophosphamide
and
docetaxel
.

The
overexpression
of
miR-663
in
breast
tumor
tissues
was
associated
with
chemoresistance;
in
MDA-MB-231
cells
,
this
chemoresistance
was
accompanied
by
the
down-regulation
of
HSPG2
,
which
was
identified
as
a
target
of
miR-663
.

MDA-MB-231
/
ADM
contained
fewer
methylated
CpG
sites
than
its
parental
cell
line
,
and
miR-663
expression
in
MDA-MB-231
cells
was
reactivated
by
5-aza-29-deoxycytidine
treatment
,
indicating
that
DNA
methylation
may
play
a
functional
role
in
the
expression
of
miR-663
.

Our
findings
suggest
that
the
overexpression
of
hypomethylated
miR-663
induced
chemoresistance
in
breast
cancer
cells
by
down-regulating
HSPG2
,
thus
providing
a
potential
target
for
the
development
of
an
microRNA-based
approach
for
breast
cancer
therapy
.
Dietary
phytochemicals
as
adjuvants
have
been
suggested
to
play
important
roles
in
enhancing
chemotherapeutic
potential
owing
to
multitargeted
chemopreventive
properties
and
lack
of
substantial
toxicity
.

Here
,
we
investigated
the
efficacy
of
the
combined
treatment
of
various
phytochemicals
with
the
anticancer
drug
clofarabine
in
malignant
mesothelioma
MSTO-211H
cells
and
normal
mesothelial
MeT-5A
cells
.

The
combined
treatment
of
resveratrol
and
clofarabine
produced
a
synergistic
antiproliferative
effect
in
MSTO-211H
cells
,
but
not
in
MeT-5A
cells
.

In
MSTO-211H
cells
,
the
nuclear
accumulation
of
Sp1
and
the
levels
of
p-Akt
,
Sp1
,
c-Met
,
cyclin
D1
,
and
p21
were
effectively
decreased
by
the
combined
treatment
of
them
.

In
combination
with
clofarabine
,
the
ability
of
resveratrol
to
reduce
the
contents
of
Sp1
and
its
target
gene
products
was
also
evident
in
a
time-
and
dose-dependent
experiment
.

The
inhibition
of
phosphoinositide
3-kinase
using
Ly294002
augmented
a
decrease
in
the
p21
level
induced
by
their
combination
,
but
it
showed
no
significant
effects
on
expression
of
Sp1
and
cyclin
D1
.

Taken
together
,
the
data
provide
evidence
that
the
synergistic
antiproliferative
effect
of
resveratrol
and
clofarabine
is
linked
to
the
inhibition
of
Akt
and
Sp1
activities
,
and
suggest
that
this
combination
may
have
therapeutic
value
in
treatment
of
malignant
mesothelioma
.
It
has
been
known
for
many
years
that
norepinephrine
(
NE
)
is
a
potent
endogenous
anticonvulsant
,
yet
there
is
confusion
as
to
which
receptor
(
s
)
mediate
this
effect
.

This
is
probably
due
to
multiple
factors
,
including
the
importance
of
distinct
signaling
pathways
for
different
seizure
paradigms
,
a
lack
of
comprehensive
pharmacological
studies
,
and
difficulty
in
interpreting
existing
pharmacological
results
due
to
the
presence
of
endogenous
NE
.

We
sought
to
circumvent
these
problems
by
testing
the
anticonvulsant
activity
of
selective
agonists
for
most
known
adrenoreceptors
(
ARs
)
in
dopamine
beta-hydroxylase
knockout
(
Dbh
-
/
-
)
mice
that
lack
endogenous
NE
.

Dbh
-
/
-
mice
are
hypersensitive
to
pentylenetetrazole
(
PTZ
)
-induced
seizures
,
demonstrating
that
endogenous
NE
inhibits
PTZ-induced
seizures
in
the
wild
type
.

Pretreatment
of
Dbh
-
/
-
mice
with
an
alpha
(
1
)
AR
or
beta
(
2
)
AR
,
but
not
an
alpha
(
2
)
AR
or
beta
(
1
)
AR
agonist
significantly
protected
against
PTZ-induced
seizures
.

In
contrast
,
only
the
beta
(
2
)
AR
agonist
showed
anticonvulsant
activity
in
heterozygous
controls
.

Furthermore
,
an
alpha
(
1
)
AR
antagonist
exacerbated
PTZ-induced
seizures
in
control
mice
,
whereas
a
beta
(
2
)
AR
antagonist
had
no
effect
.

We
conclude
that
activation
of
the
alpha
(
1
)
AR
is
primarily
responsible
for
the
anticonvulsant
activity
of
endogenous
NE
in
the
murine
PTZ
model
of
epilepsy
.

Endogenous
NE
probably
does
not
activate
the
beta
(
2
)
AR
under
these
conditions
,
but
exogenous
activation
of
the
beta
(
2
)
AR
produces
an
anticonvulsant
effect
.
We
recently
showed
that
the
developmentally
important
family
of
SOX
(
SRY
(
sex
determining
region
on
the
Y
chromosome
)
-related
high
mobility
group
(
HMG
)
box
)
proteins
require
the
calcium-binding
protein
calmodulin
(
CaM
)
for
optimal
nuclear
accumulation
,
with
clinical
mutations
in
SRY
that
specifically
impair
nuclear
accumulation
via
this
pathway
resulting
in
XY
sex
reversal
.

However
,
the
mechanism
by
which
CaM
facilitates
nuclear
accumulation
is
unknown
.

Here
,
we
show
,
for
the
first
time
,
that
the
70-kDa
heat
shock
cognate
protein
hsc70
plays
a
key
role
in
CaM-dependent
nuclear
import
of
SRY
.

Using
a
reconstituted
nuclear
import
assay
,
we
show
that
antibodies
to
hsc70
significantly
reduce
nuclear
accumulation
of
wild
type
SRY
and
mutant
derivatives
thereof
that
retain
CaM-dependent
nuclear
import
,
with
an
increased
rate
of
nuclear
accumulation
upon
addition
of
both
CaM
and
hsc70
,
in
contrast
to
an
SRY
mutant
derivative
with
impaired
CaM
binding
.

siRNA
knockdown
of
hsc70
in
intact
cells
showed
similar
results
,
indicating
clear
dependence
upon
hsc70
for
CaM-dependent
nuclear
import
.

Analysis
using
the
technique
of
fluorescence
recovery
after
photobleaching
indicated
that
hsc70
is
required
for
the
maximal
rate
of
SRY
nuclear
import
in
living
cells
but
has
no
impact
upon
SRY
nuclear
retention
/
nuclear
dynamics
.

Finally
,
we
demonstrate
direct
binding
of
hsc70
to
the
SRY·CaM
complex
,
with
immunoprecipitation
experiments
from
cell
extracts
showing
association
of
hsc70
with
wild
type
SRY
,
but
not
with
a
mutant
derivative
with
impaired
CaM
binding
,
dependent
on
Ca
(
2
+
)
.

Our
novel
findings
strongly
implicate
hsc70
in
CaM-dependent
nuclear
import
of
SRY
.
Apigenin
promotes
apoptosis
in
cancer
cells
.

We
studied
the
effect
of
apigenin
on
cell
survival
and
c-Myc
expression
in
FRO
anaplastic
thyroid
carcinoma
(
ATC
)
cells
.

Apigenin
caused
apoptosis
via
the
elevation
of
c-Myc
levels
in
conjunction
with
the
phosphorylation
of
p38
and
p53
.

In
the
c-Myc
siRNA-transfected
and
apigenin-treated
cells
,
compared
with
the
apigenin-treated
control
cells
,
apoptosis
and
phosphorylation
of
p38
and
p53
were
ameliorated
.

In
the
presence
of
apigenin
,
diminution
of
p38
and
p53
did
not
affect
cell
survival
although
apigenin
activated
the
phosphorylation
of
p38
and
p53
via
increased
c-Myc
levels
.

In
conclusion
,
our
results
indicate
that
apigenin
induces
apoptosis
mediated
via
c-Myc
with
concomitant
phosphorylation
of
p53
and
p38
in
FRO
ATC
cells
.

These
findings
suggest
that
augmented
c-Myc
acts
as
a
core
regulator
and
is
necessary
for
apigenin-induced
apoptosis
in
FRO
ATC
cells
.

and
both

in

Investigation
of

that
the

were
treated
with
APAP
to
compare
the
mechanisms

Lpr
mice
were
partially
protected

as
indicated
by

,
demonstrating

.

There
was

.

Interestingly
,
hepatic

recovered
faster
in

than
in

were
significantly

protein
kinases

suggest
that
tight
spatial
and
temporal
regulation
of
mitogen-activated

kinase
signaling
is
necessary
to
achieve
harmonious
growth

elongation
and

.

We
provide
here
evidence
that
neurofibromin
,
via
its

activity
,
controls
ERK1

fibroblast

in

We
show
first
that
neurofibromin
is
expressed
in
FGFR-positive
prehypertrophic
and
hypertrophic
chondrocytes
during
growth
plate
endochondral

.

Using

)
in
type
II
collagen-expressing

,
(
Nf1col2

mutant
mice
)
,
we
then
show
that
lack
of
neurofibromin
in
post-mitotic
chondrocytes
triggers
a
number
of
phenotypes
reminiscent
of
the
ones
observed
in
mice
characterized
by
FGFR
gain-of-function
mutations
.

Those
include
dwarfism
,
constitutive

,
strongly
reduced

Using
wildtype
(

)
and
Nf1
(

in

,
we
show
that
FGF2

triggers
rapid
ERK1

in
both
genotypes
,
but
that
return
to

Together
,
these
results
underscore
the
requirement
of
neurofibromin
and
ERK1

2
for
normal
endochondral
bone
formation
and
support
the
notion
that
neurofibromin
,
by
restraining
RAS-ERK1

signaling
,
is
a
negative
regulator
of
FGFR
signaling
in
differentiating
chondrocytes

An
understanding
of
the

relationships
between

subunits
and
their
redundancy
and
specificity
is
essential
for
understanding
the

Previously

Here
we

the
binding
of
FGF-1
,

order
of

.

None
of
the
three
FGFs
detectably
bind
Ig
module
I
or
the
IIIb
and
IIIc
splice
variants
of
Ig
module
III
in
the
absence
of
flanking
sequences
.

Ig
module
I
and
the
C-terminus
of
Ig
module
III
are
dispensable
for
high-affinity
binding
of
FGF-1
,
FGF-2
,
and
FGF-7
.

Alterations
in
highly

Ig

and
substitution
of
individual
sequence
domains
spanning
the
entire
sequence
of
Ig
module
II
with
those
from
Ig
module
I
obliterated
FGF
binding
.

Addition
of
a
specific
number
of
FGFR
sequences
to
the
C-terminus
of
Ig
module
II
resulted
in
a
gain
in
affinity
for
FGF-7
.

Several
site-specific
alterations
in
the
C-terminus
of
full-length
FGFR1IIIc
,
an
isoform
that
otherwise
absolutely
rejects
FGF-7
,
resulted
in
gain
of
FGF-7
binding
.

These
results
suggest
that
a
complex
of
Ig
module
II
and
heparan
sulfate
is
the
base
common
active
core
of
the
FGFR
ectodomain
and
that
flanking
structural
domains
modify
FGF
affinity
and
determine
specificity
.

In
the
present
study
,
the
anti-inflammatory
effect
of
salicylideneamino-2-thiophenol
(
SAL-2
)
,
a
derivative
of
salicylate
,
on
a
potent
oxidant
4-hydroxynonenal
(
HNE
)
-induced
oxidative
stress
was
investigated
using
rat
prostate
endothelial
(
YPEN-1
)
cells
.

We
focused
on
anti-inflammatory
activity
of
SAL-2
which
was
determined
by
its
ability
to
suppress
COX-2
and
iNOS
gene
expression
through
suppression
of
NF-κB
and
redox
regulation
.

We
found
that
SAL-2
effectively
inhibited
HNE-induced
reactive
species
generation
,
while
upregulated
GSH
/
GSSG
ratio
.

Prostagrandin
(
PG
)
E2
production
stimulated
by
arachidonic
acid
was
suppressed
by
SAL-2
.

SAL-2
also
downregulated
COX-2
and
iNOS
expression
induced
by
HNE
,
but
salicylate
did
not
.

We
found
that
SAL-2
inhibited
HNE-mediated
IKK
phosphorylation
,
IκBα
degradation
and
nuclear
translocation
of
p65
which
are
linked
to
NF-κB
activation
.

Furthermore
,
SAL-2
inhibited
HNE-induced
activation
of
mitogen-activated
protein
kinases
.

Collectively
,
SAL-2
inhibited
COX-2
and
iNOS
gene
expression
through
suppression
of
NF-κB
leading
to
the
inhibition
of
PGE2
synthesis
.

Based
on
these
data
,
we
propose
that
with
its
combined
effect
on
strong
anti-oxidant
and
anti-inflammatory
action
,
SAL-2
can
be
a
potent
anti-inflammatory
agent
for
treatment
of
inflammatory-related
diseases
.
The
relation
between
serotonin
release
and
electrical
activity
was
examined
in
the
nucleus
raphe
magnus
of
rats
anesthetized
with
pentobarbital
.

Serotonin
levels
were
monitored
through
a
carbon-fiber
microelectrode
by
fast
cyclic
voltammetry
(
usually
at
1
Hz
)
.

Single-cell
firing
was
recorded
through
the
same
microelectrode
,
except
during
the
voltammetry
waveform
and
associated
electrical
artifact
(
totaling
about
30
ms
)
.

Multi-barrel
micropipettes
incorporating
the
voltammetry
electrode
were
used
for
iontophoresis
of
drugs
.

Cells
were
inhibited
,
excited
or
unaffected
by
noxious
mechanical
skin
stimulation
.

These
were
respectively
designated
as
off
(
M
)
cells
,
on
(
M
)
cells
and
neutral
(
M
)
cells
,
M
denoting
mechanical
.

During
3
min
of
pinching
,
serotonin
slowly
rose
near
seven
of
14
on
(
M
)
cells
and
26
of
46
off
(
M
)
cells;
it
fell
near
two
off
(
M
)
cells;
it
was
unchanged
near
all
other
cells
,
including
six
neutral
(
M
)
cells
.

On
a
finer
spatiotemporal
scale
,
near
four
of
seven
on
(
M
)
cells
,
10
of
14
off
(
M
)
cells
and
0
of
four
neutral
(
M
)
cells
,
average
serotonin
levels
fell
significantly
within
+
/
-
100
ms
of
spontaneous
spikes
.

Lower
serotonin
may
have
caused
the
higher
spike
probability;
the
converse
is
theoretically
unlikely
,
since
delays
between
release
and
detection
are
estimated
to
exceed
100
ms
.

Increased
serotonin
and
decreased
firing
were
always
seen
following
iontophoresis
or
intravenous
injection
(
1
mg
/
kg
)
of
the
serotonin
re-uptake
inhibitor
clomipramine
(
n
=
7
)
.

Iontophoresis
of
+
/
-
propranolol
,
whose
serotonergic
actions
include
antagonism
and
partial
agonism
at
5-HT1
receptors
,
also
increased
serotonin
and
decreased
firing
(
n
=
4
)
.

Methiothepin
(
intravenous
,
1
mg
/
kg
)
,
whose
serotonergic
actions
include
5-HT1
and
5-HT2
antagonism
,
typically
raised
serotonin
levels
(
four
of
five
cells
)
and
always
blocked
inhibition
by
clomipramine
(
n
=
3
)
.

Iontophoresis
of
glutamate
always
lowered
serotonin
and
increased
firing
(
n
=
4
)
.

Since
serotonin
levels
and
firing
were
usually
inversely
correlated
,
except
near
on
(
M
)
cells
during
pinch
,
we
propose
that
serotonin
is
released
from
terminals
of
incoming
nociceptive
afferents
.

Prior
neuroanatomical
knowledge
favors
a
midbrain
origin
for
these
afferents
,
while
some
of
the
drug
findings
suggest
that
their
terminals
possess
inhibitory
serotonergic
autoreceptors
,
possibly
of
5-HT1b
subtype
.

The
released
serotonin
could
contribute
to
the
inhibition
of
off
(
M
)
cells
and
excitation
of
on
(
M
)
cells
by
noxious
stimulation
,
since
inhibitory
5-HT1a
receptors
and
excitatory
5-HT2
receptors
,
respectively
,
have
previously
been
shown
to
dominate
their
serotonergic
responses
.
The
RNase
Protection
Assay
was
used
to
examine
the
regulation
of
D2
and
D4
dopamine
receptor
mRNAs
in
the
cerebral
cortex
and
neostriatum
of
nonhuman
primates
after
chronic
treatment
with
a
wide
spectrum
of
antipsychotic
medications
(
chlorpromazine
,
clozapine
,
haloperidol
,
molindone
,
olanzapine
,
pimozide
,
remoxipride
and
risperidone
)
.

Tiapride
,
a
D2
antagonist
that
lacks
antipsychotic
activity
,
was
also
included
.

All
drugs
were
administered
orally
for
6
months
at
doses
recommended
for
humans
.

All
antipsychotic
drug
treatments
examined
in
this
study
caused
a
statistically
significant
up-regulation
of
both
the
long
and
short
isoforms
of
the
D2
receptor
mRNAs
in
the
prefrontal
and
temporal
cortex
.

Tiapride
,
in
contrast
,
significantly
up-regulated
only
the
level
of
D2-long
mRNA
in
these
areas
.

The
same
drug
treatments
produced
less
uniform
effects
in
the
neostriatum
than
in
the
cortex
:
clozapine
and
olanzapine
failed
to
significantly
elevate
either
D2-long
or
D2-short
receptor
messages
in
this
structure
unlike
all
other
drugs
,
including
tiapride
.

In
both
the
cerebral
cortex
and
striatum
,
D4
receptor
mRNA
was
upregulated
by
certain
typical
(
chlorpromazine
and
haloperidol
)
and
certain
atypical
(
clozapine
,
olanzapine
and
risperidone
)
antipsychotic
agents
as
well
as
by
tiapride
.

Other
drugs
of
the
typical
(
molindone
and
pimozide
)
and
atypical
(
remoxipride
)
classes
had
no
effect
on
D4
mRNA
levels
in
either
cortical
or
striatal
tissue
.

The
finding
that
up-regulation
of
D2
dopamine
receptor
mRNAs
was
a
consistently
observed
effect
of
a
wide
range
of
antipsychotic
agents
in
the
cerebral
cortex
but
not
in
the
neostriatum
,
coupled
with
the
fact
that
the
D2-short
isoforms
in
the
cortex
were
not
regulated
by
a
nonantipsychotic
D2
antagonist
,
tiapride
,
draws
attention
to
the
importance
of
the
D2
dopamine
receptor
in
the
cerebral
cortex
as
a
potentially
critical
,
common
site
of
action
of
antipsychotic
medications
.
Activation
of

prostaglandin
synthase-1
by
minoxidil
as
a
possible

for
its

In
this
article
,
we
checked
the
effect
of
2
,
3-dimercaptosuccinic
acid-coated
Fe
(
3
)
O
(
4
)
nanoparticles
on
gene
expression
of

.
7
cells
and
found
that
the
transcription
of
several
important
genes
related
to
intracellular
iron
homeostasis
were
significantly
changed
.

We
thus
speculated
that
the
cellular
iron
homeostasis
might
be
disturbed
by
this
nanoparticle
through
releasing
iron
ion
in
cells
.

To
verify
this
speculation
,
we
first
confirmed
the
transcriptional
changes
of
several
key
iron
homeostasis-
related
genes
,
such
as
Tfrc
,
Trf
,
and
Lcn2
,
using
quantitative
PCR
,
and
found
that
an
iron
ion
chelator
,
desferrioxamine
,
could
alleviate
the
transcriptional
alterations
of
two
typical
genes
,
Tfrc
and
Lcn2
.

Then
,
we
designed
and
validated
a
method
based
on
centrifugation
for
assaying
intracellular
irons
in
ion
and
nanoparticle
state
.

After
extensive
measures
of
intracellular
iron
in
two
forms
and
total
iron
,
we
found
that
the
intracellular
iron
ion
significantly
increased
with
intracellular
total
iron
and
nanoparticle
iron
,
demonstrating
degradation
of
this
nanoparticle
into
iron
ion
in
cells
.

We
next
mimicked
the
intralysosomal
environment
in
vitro
and
verified
that
the
internalized
iron
nanoparticle
could
release
iron
ion
in
lysosome
.

We
found
that
as
another
important
compensatory
response
to
intracellular
overload
of
iron
ion
,
cells
significantly
downregulated
the
expressions
of
genes
belonging
to
solute
carrier
family
which
are
responsible
for
transferring
many
organic
solutes
into
cells
,
such
as
Slc5a3
and
Slc44a1
,
in
order
to
prevent
more
organic
solutes
into
cells
and
thus
lower
the
intracellular
osmosis
.

Based
on
these
findings
,
we
profiled
a
map
of
gene
effects
after
cells
were
treated
with
this
iron
nanoparticle
and
concluded
that
the
iron
nanoparticles
might
be
more
detrimental
to
cell
than
iron
ion
due
to
its
intracellular
internalization
fashion
,
nonspecific
endocytosis
.
Arsenic
compounds
that
are
often
found
in
drinking
water
increase
the
risk
of
developmental
brain
disorders
.

In
this
study
,
we
performed
live
imaging
analyses
of
Neuro-2a
cells
expressing
SCAT3
,
a
caspase-3
cleavage
peptide
sequence
linking
two
fluorescent
proteins;
enhanced
cyan
fluorescence
protein
(
ECFP
)
and
Venus
,
to
determine
whether
sodium
arsenite
(
NaAsO
(
2
)
;
0
,
1
,
5
,
or
10
μM
)
affects
both
neurite
outgrowth
and
/
or
induces
apoptosis
with
the
same
doses
and
in
the
same
cell
cultures
.

We
observed
that
the
area
ratio
of
neurite
to
cell
body
in
SCAT3-expressing
cells
was
significantly
reduced
by
5
and
10
μM
NaAsO
(
2
)
,
but
not
by
1
μM
,
although
the
emission
ratio
of
ECFP
to
Venus
,
an
endpoint
of
caspase-3
activity
,
was
not
changed
.

However
,
cytological
assay
using
apoptotic
and
necrotic
markers
resulted
in
that
apoptosis
,
but
not
necrosis
,
was
significantly
induced
in
Neuro-2a
cells
when
NaAsO
(
2
)
exposure
continued
after
the
significant
effects
of
NaAsO
(
2
)
on
neurite
outgrowth
were
found
by
live
imaging
.

These
results
suggested
that
neurite
outgrowth
was
suppressed
by
NaAsO
(
2
)
prior
to
NaAsO
(
2
)
-induced
apoptosis
.

Next
,
we
examined
the
effects
of
NaAsO
(
2
)
on
cytoskeletal
gene
expression
in
Neuro-2a
cells
.

NaAsO
(
2
)
increased
the
mRNA
levels
of
the
light
and
medium
subunits
of
neurofilament
and
decreased
the
mRNA
levels
of
tau
and
tubulin
in
a
dose-dependent
manner;
no
significant
effect
was
found
in
the
mRNA
levels
of
the
heavy
subunit
of
neurofilament
,
microtubule-associated
protein
2
,
or
actin
.

The
changes
in
cytoskeletal
gene
expression
are
likely
responsible
for
the
inhibitory
effects
of
NaAsO
(
2
)
on
neurite
outgrowth

G

kinases
(
GRKs
)
initiate
the
deactivation
of
GPCRs
by
phosphorylating
their
cytoplasmic
loops
and
C-terminal
tails
.

They
are
regulated
not
only
by
allosteric
interactions
with
activated
GPCRs
,
but
also
by
the
membrane
environment
itself
.

Herein
we
describe
how
the
various
GRKs
are
recruited
to
lipid
bilayers
and
,
where
evident
,
how
specific
anionic
phospholipids
help
regulate
their

Using
crystal
structures
representing

of

we
map
the
lipid
binding
sites
in
order
to
better
understand
how
these
enzymes
are
oriented
at
the
cell
surface

This
analysis
suggests
that
GRKs
bind

Expression
of
pituitary
FSH
and
LH
,
under
the
control
of
pulsatile
GnRH
,
is
essential
for
fertility
.

cAMP
response
element-binding
protein
(
CREB
)
has
been
implicated
in
the
regulation
of
FSHβ
gene
expression
,
but
the
molecular
mechanisms
by
which
pulsatile
GnRH
regulates
CREB
activation
remain
poorly
understood
.

We
hypothesized
that
CREB
is
activated
by
a
distinct
signaling
pathway
in
response
to
pulsatile
GnRH
in
a
frequency-dependent
manner
to
dictate
the
FSHβ
transcriptional
response
.

GnRH
stimulation
of
CREB
phosphorylation
(
pCREB
)
in
the
gonadotrope-derived
LβT2
cell
line
was
attenuated
by
a
protein
kinase
A
(
PKA
)
inhibitor
,
H89
.

A
dominant
negative
PKA
(
DNPKA
)
reduced
GnRH-stimulated
pCREB
and
markedly
decreased
GnRH
stimulation
of
FSHβ
mRNA
and
FSHβLUC
activity
,
but
had
little
effect
on
LHβLUC
activity
,
indicating
relative
specificity
of
this
pathway
.

In
perifusion
studies
,
FSHβ
mRNA
levels
and
FSHβLUC
activities
were
increased
by
pulsatile
GnRH
,
with
significantly
greater
increases
at
low
compared
with
high
pulse
frequencies
.

DNPKA
markedly
reduced
these
GnRH-stimulated
FSHβ
responses
at
both
low
and
high
pulse
frequencies
.

Correlating
with
FSHβ
activation
,
both
PKA
activity
and
levels
of
pCREB
were
increased
to
a
greater
extent
by
low
compared
with
high
GnRH
pulse
frequencies
,
and
the
induction
of
pCREB
was
also
attenuated
by
overexpression
of
DNPKA
at
both
low
and
high
pulse
frequencies
.

Taken
together
,
these
data
indicate
that
a
PKA-mediated
signaling
pathway
mediates
GnRH
activation
of
CREB
at
low-pulse
frequencies
,
playing
a
significant
role
in
the
decoding
of
the
hypothalamic
GnRH
signal
to
result
in
frequency-dependent
FSHβ
activation
.
We
examined
the
ability
of
oxidation
products
of
dopamine
,
DOPA
,
and
3
,
4-dihydroxyphenylacetic
acid
(
DOPAC
)
to
inhibit
proteasomal
activity
.

Dopamine
,
DOPA
,
and
DOPAC
underwent
tyrosinase-catalyzed
oxidation
to
generate
aminochrome
,
dopachrome
,
and
furanoquinone
,
respectively
.

In
these
studies
,
the
oxidation
of
dopamine
by
tyrosinase
generated
product
(
s
)
that
inhibited
the
proteasome
,
and
proteasomal
inhibition
correlated
with
the
presence
of
the
UV-visible
spectrum
of
aminochrome
.

The
addition
of
superoxide
dismutase
and
catalase
did
not
prevent
proteasomal

Although
NQO1
protected
against

,

aminochrome
by
NQO1
led
to
oxygen
uptake
because
of
the
generation
of
a
redox-labile
cyclized
hydroquinone
,
further
demonstrating
the
lack
of
involvement
of
oxygen
radicals
in
proteasomal
inhibition
.

DOPA
underwent
tyrosinase-catalyzed
oxidation
to
form
dopachrome
,
and
similar
to
aminochrome
,
proteasomal
inhibition
correlated
with
the
presence
of
a
dopachrome
UV-visible
spectrum
.

The
inclusion
of
NQO1
did
not
protect
against
proteasomal
inhibition
induced
by
dopachrome
.

Oxidation
of
DOPAC
by
tyrosinase
generated
furanoquinone
,
which
was
a
poor
proteasome
inhibitor
.

These
studies
demonstrate
that
oxidation
products
,
including
cyclized
quinones
derived
from
dopamine
and
related
compounds
,
rather
than
oxygen
radicals
have
the
ability
to
inhibit
the
proteasome
.

They
also
suggest
an
important
protective
role
for
NQO1
in
protecting
against
dopamine-induced
proteasomal
inhibition
.

The
ability
of
endogenous
intermediates
formed
during
dopaminergic
metabolism
to
cause
proteasomal
inhibition
provides
a
potential
basis
for
the
selectivity
of
dopaminergic

damage

Pemetrexed
(
Alimta
,
LY231514
)
is
a
new
multitargeted
antifolate
that
inhibits
several
enzymes
involved
in
the
folate
pathway
.

Pemetrexed
is
a
potent
inhibitor
of
thymidylate
synthase
,
dihydrofolate
reductase
,
and
glycinamide
ribonucleotide
formyltransferase
.

Pemetrexed
has
demonstrated
clinical
activity
in
non-small-cell
lung
cancer
(
NSCLC
)
as
well
as
in
a
broad
array
of
other
solid
tumors
including
mesothelioma
and
breast
,
colorectal
,

,
cervical
,

,
and
pancreatic
cancer
.

In
NSCLC
,
single-agent
activity
has
been
documented
in
the
first-
and
second-line
settings
.

Promising
activity
has
also
been
demonstrated
when
pemetrexed
is
combined
with
cisplatin
,
vinorelbine
,
oxaliplatin
,
carboplatin

and

has
significantly
improved
the
safety
profile
of
pemetrexed
without

In
this
review
,
the
pharmacology
and
clinical
activity
of
pemetrexed
in
NSCLC
cancer
is
discussed
.
Pain
is
a
common
complaint
,
often
occurring
in
conjunction
with
inflammation
.

Nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory
drugs
(
NSAIDs
)
are
the
most
commonly
used
analgesic
agents
in
ambulatory
patients
.

In
recent
studies
,
the
cyclooxygenase-2
(
COX-2
)
inhibitor
rofecoxib
demonstrated
analgesic
effects
similar
to
those
of
NSAIDs
in
the
treatment
of
acute
pain
and
primary
dysmenorrhea
.

The
present
randomized
,
single-dose
,
double-blind
,
double-dummy
,
placebo-
and
active-comparator-controlled
,
parallel-group
study
was
undertaken
to
compare
the
analgesic
efficacy
of
the
COX-2
inhibitors
rofecoxib
50
mg
and
celecoxib
200
mg
with
that
of
ibuprofen
400
mg
and
placebo
in
patients
with
postoperative
dental
pain
.

Two
hundred
and
seventy-two
patients
experiencing
pain
after
the
removal
of

or

2
third
molars
were
randomized
according
to
pain
severity
(
moderate
vs
severe
)
to
receive
a
single
dose
of
placebo
(
n
=
45
)
,
rofecoxib
50
mg
(
n
=
90
)
,
celecoxib
200
mg
(
n
=
91
)
,
or
ibuprofen
400
mg
(
n
=
46
)
.

Using
a
patient
diary
,
patients
recorded
pain
intensity
,
pain
relief
,
and
global
evaluations
throughout
the
24-hour
period
after
dosing
.

The
overall
analgesic
effect
,
onset
of
action
,
peak
effect
,
and
duration
of
effect
were
evaluated
,
with
the
primary
end
point
being
total
pain
relief
over
8
hours
(
TOPAR8
)
.

The
safety
profile
was
assessed
on
the
basis
of
physical
findings
,
laboratory
results
,
and
spontaneous
reports
of
adverse
experiences
.

The
results
showed
that
compared
with
celecoxib
,
rofecoxib
had
superior
analgesic
effects
on
all
measures
of
analgesic
efficacy
,
including
overall
analgesic

(

,

,
peak

,
and
duration

(

)
.

In
addition
,
rofecoxib's
analgesic
efficacy
was
similar
to
that
of
ibuprofen
(
TOPAR8
,

.

,
but
the
duration
was
longer
(
P<0

)
;
with
ibuprofen
,
the
time
to
on
set
was
24
minutes
,
peak
pain
relief
score
was
2
.

,
and
duration
of
analgesic
effect
was
8
.
9
hours
.

The
safety
profile
was
similar
across
all
treatment
groups
.

Thus
rofecoxib
provided
analgesic
efficacy
superior
to
that
of
celecoxib
and
comparable
to
that
of
ibuprofen
in
the
treatment
of
patients
with
acute
postoperative
dental

Low-dimensional
nanostructures
offer
a
host
of
intriguing
properties
which
are
distinct
from
those
of
the
bulk
material
,
owing
to
size-confinement
effects
and
amplified
surface
areas
.

Here
,
we
report
on
the
scalable
,
bottom-up
synthesis
of
ultrathin
coordination
polymer
nanosheets
via
surfactant-mediated
synthesis
and
subsequent
exfoliation
.

Layers
of
a
two-dimensional
(
2D
)
zinc
coordination
polymer
are
self-assembled
in
the
interlamellar
space
of
a
reverse
microemulsion
mesophase
into
stacks
of
nanosheets
interleaved
with
cethyltrimethylammonium
bromide
(
CTAB
)
at
regular
intervals
,
thus
giving
rise
to
a
lamellar
hybrid
mesostructure
with
a
lattice
period
of
∼8
nm
and
an
underlying
highly
crystalline
substructure
.

The
basic
structural
motif
is
composed
of
2D
acetato-benzimidazolato-zinc
layers
of
tetrahedrally
coordinated
zinc
joined
together
by
anionic
acetate
and
benzimidazolate
ligands
.

The
hierarchical
structure
was
studied
by
PXRD
,
TEM
,
EDX
,
EELS
,
AFM
,
and
solid-state
NMR
spectroscopy
,
revealing
a
high
level
of
order
on
both
the
atomic
and
mesoscale
,
suggesting
fairly
strong
interactions
along
the
organic-inorganic
hybrid
interface
.

Exfoliation
of
the
hybrid
material
in
organic
solvents
such
as
THF
and
chloroform
yields
sheet-
and
belt-like
nanostructures
with
lateral
sizes
between
10's
and
100's
of
nanometers
and
a
height
of
about
10
nm
measured
by
AFM
,
which
precisely
maps
the
basal
spacing
of
the
lamellar
mesostructure;
further
exfoliation
results
in
nanobelts
with
minimum
sizes
around
4
nm
.

Finally
,
the
sheetlike
nanostructures
behave
as
morphological
chameleons
,
transforming
into
highly
regular
multiwalled
coordination
polymer
nanotubes
upon
treatment
with
organic
solvents
.

with
an
IC

of
6

comparable

the

Glimepiride
was
much

effective
at

These
results
are

the
suggestion

However
,
glimepiride
is
much
less
effective
when
K

this
may
reflect
a
reduction

While
manganese
(
Mn
)
is
essential
for
proper
central
nervous
system
(
CNS
)
development
,
excessive
Mn
exposure
may
lead
to
neurotoxicity
.

Mn
preferentially
accumulates
in
the
basal
ganglia
,
and
in
adults
it
may
cause
Parkinson's
disease-like
disorder
.

Compared
to
adults
,
younger
individuals
accumulate
greater
Mn
levels
in
the
CNS
and
are
more
vulnerable
to
its
toxicity
.

Moreover
,
the
mechanisms
mediating
developmental
Mn-induced
neurotoxicity
are
not
completely
understood
.

The
present
study
investigated
the
developmental
neurotoxicity
elicited
by
Mn
exposure
(
5
,
10
and
20
mg
/
kg;
i
.

p
.

)
from
postnatal
day
8
to
PN27
in
rats
.

Neurochemical
analyses
were
carried
out
on
PN29
,
with
a
particular
focus
on
striatal
alterations
in
intracellular
signaling
pathways
(
MAPKs
,
Akt
and
DARPP-32
)
,
oxidative
stress
generation
and
cell
death
.

Motor
alterations
were
evaluated
later
in
life
at
3
,
4
or
5
weeks
of
age
.

Mn
exposure
(
20
mg
/
kg
)
increased
p38
(
MAPK
)
and
Akt
phosphorylation
,
but
decreased
DARPP-32-Thr-34
phosphorylation
.

Mn
(
10
and
20
mg
/
kg
)
increased
caspase
activity
and
F
(
2
)
-isoprostane
production
(
a
biological
marker
of
lipid
peroxidation
)
.

Paralleling
the
changes
in
striatal
biochemical
parameters
,
Mn
(
20
mg
/
kg
)
also
caused
motor
impairment
,
evidenced
by
increased
falling
latency
in
the
rotarod
test
,
decreased
distance
traveled
and
motor
speed
in
the
open-field
test
.

Notably
,
the
antioxidant
Trolox™
reversed
the
Mn
(
20
mg
/
kg
)
-dependent
augmentation
in
p38
(
MAPK
)
phosphorylation
and
reduced
the
Mn
(
20
mg
/
kg
)
-induced
caspase
activity
and
F
(
2
)
-isoprostane
production
.

Trolox™
also
reversed
the
Mn-induced
motor
coordination
deficits
.

These
findings
are
the
first
to
show
that
long-term
exposure
to
Mn
during
a
critical
period
of
neurodevelopment
causes
motor
coordination
dysfunction
with
parallel
increment
in
oxidative
stress
markers
,
p38
(
MAPK
)
phosphorylation
and
caspase
activity
in
the
striatum
.

Moreover
,
we
establish
Trolox™
as
a
potential
neuroprotective
agent
given
its
efficacy
in
reversing
the
Mn-induced
neurodevelopmental
effects
.
Previous
studies
by
this
research
team
proved
that
vasodilating
prostaglandins
(
PGs
)
E1
,
E2
and
I2
inhibit
carbonic
anhydrase
(
CA
)
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
,
which
suggested
involvement
of
CA
in
gastric
acid
secretion
inhibition
and
the
increase
of
gastric
mucosa
blood
flow
produced
by
this
group
of
PGs
.

Relying
on
these
findings
,
as
well
as
on
our
clinical
observations
,
we
studied
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
the
effects
of
nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory
drugs
(
NSAIDs
)
on
CA
I
and
CA
II
.

We
also
followed
in
vitro
the
effects
on
these
isozymes
of
NSAIDs
associated
to
histamine
,
Ca
,
PGE2
and
acetazolamide
.

The
results
show
that
the
NSAIDs
used
here
,
which
reduce
the
activity
of
cyclooxygenase
and
PG
production
,
activated
CA
I
and
CA
II
in
a
dose-dependent
manner
by
a
mechanism
of
the
noncompetitive
type
.

Histamine
and
Ca
added
to
NSAIDs
amplified
the
activating
effect
of
the
latter
on
CA
II
.

Association
of
PGE2
or
acetazolamide
to
NSAIDs
reduced
NSAID-induced
activation
of
CA
I
and
CA
II
.

Indomethacin
abolished
the
inhibitory
effect
of
acetazolamide
on
CA
I
and
CA
II
.

Our
data
imply
that
between
CA
and
cyclooxygenase
there
is
an
inverse
relationship
,
CA
activation
being
accompanied
by
reduction
of
cyclooxygenase
activity
,
a
reduction
achieved
by
the
pH
modifications
induced
by
CA
activation
.

In
this
way
,
cyclooxygenase
,
inhibition
occurs
"via
CA
,
"
with
the
pH
variations
it
brings
about
.
Oxidative
stress
caused
hepatic
fibrosis
by
activating
hepatic
stellate
cells
(
HSCs
)
,
which
were
implemented
by
depressing
PPARγ
activation
.

Hydroxysafflor
yellow
A
(
HSYA
)
as
a
nature
active
ingredient
with
antioxidant
capacity
was
able
to
effectively
attenuate
oxidative
stress
mediated
injury
.

So
it
will
be
very
interesting
to
study
effect
of
HSYA
on
HSCs
activation
and
liver
fibrosis
,
and
reveal
the
role
of
PPARγ·CCl4
and
H2O2
were
used
to
mimic
oxidative
stress
mediated
hepatic
injury
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
respectively
.

The
anti-fibrosis
effects
of
HSYA
were
evaluated
and
its
mechanisms
were
disclosed
by
applying
western
blot
,
histopathological
analysis
,
flow
cytometry
,
RT-PCR
and
ELISA
.

Our
results
showed
that
HSCs
activation
and
proliferation
could
be
induced
by
oxidative
stress
,
and
the
expressive
levels
of
TGF-β1
and
TIMP-1
,
the
serum
levels
of
ALT
,
AST
,
HA
,
LN
,
III-C
and
IV-C
were
also
enhanced
by
oxidative
stress
,
which
is
correlated
with
liver
fibrosis
(
p<0
.
05
or
p<0
.
01
)
.

HSYA
was
able
to
effectively
inhibit
oxidative
stress
mediated
hepatic
injury
by
increasing
the
activities
of
antioxidant
enzymes
,
up
regulating
the
expression
of
PPARγ
and
MMP-2
,
and
down
regulating
the
expression
of
TGF-β1
and
TIMP-1
,
and
reducing
α-SMA
level
.

The
protective
effect
of
HSYA
can
be
significantly
attenuated
by
GW9662
via
blocking
PPARγ
(
p<0
.
05
or
p<0
.
01
)
.

Taken
together
,
these
results
demonstrate
that
HSYA
is
able
to
significantly
protect
the
liver
from
oxidative
stress
,
which
requires
for
HSYA
to
stimulate
PPARγ
activity
,
reduce
cell
proliferation
and
suppress
ECM
synthesis
.

alkaloids
from
the
marine
sponge
Crambe
crambe
.

Although
very
little
information
about
their
biological
effect
has
been
reported
,
it
is
known
that
crambescidin
816
(
Cramb816
)
blocks
calcium
channels
in
a
neuroblastoma
X
glioma
cell
line
.

Taking
this
into
account
,
and
the
fact
that
ion
channels
are
frequent
targets
for
natural
toxins
,
we
examined
the
effect
of
Cramb816
and
three
compounds
from
the
crambescin
family
,
norcrambescin
A2
(
NcrambA2
)
,
crambescin
A2
(
CrambA2
)
,
and
crambescin
C1
(
CrambC1
)
,
in
the
main
voltage-dependent
ion
channels
in
neurons
:
sodium
,
potassium
,
and
calcium
channels
.

Electrophysiological
recordings
of
voltage
gated
sodium
,
potassium
,
and
calcium
currents
,
in
the
presence
of
these
guanidine
alkaloids
,
were
performed
in
cortical
neurons
from
embryonic
mice
.

Different
effects
were
discovered
:
crambescins
inhibited
K
(
+
)
currents
with
the
following
potency
:
NcrambA2
>
CrambC1
>
CrambA2
,
while
Cramb816
lacked
an
effect
.

Only
CrambC1
and
Cramb816
partially
blocked
Na
(
+
)
total
current
.

However
,
Cramb816
partially
blocked
Ca
(
2
+
)
,
while
NcrambA2
did
not
.

Since
the
blocking
effect
of
Cramb816
on
calcium
currents
has
not
been
previously
reported
in
detail
,
we
further
pharmacologically
isolated
the
two
main
fractions
of
HVA
Ca
(
2
+
)
channels
in
neurons
and
investigated
the
Cramb816
effect
on
them
.

Here
,
we
revealed
that
Cav1
or
L-type
calcium
channels
are
the
main
target
for
Cramb816
.

These
two
families
of
guanidine
alkaloids
clearly
showed
a
structure-activity
relationship
with
the
crambescins
acting
on
voltage-gated
potassium
channels
,
while
Cramb816
blocks
the
voltage-gated
calcium
channel
Cav1
with
higher
potency
than
nifedipine
.

The
novel
evidence
that
Cramb816
partially
blocked
Ca
(
V
)
and
Na
(
V
)
channels
in
neurons
suggests
that
this
compound
might
be
involved
in
decreasing
the
neurotransmitter
release
and
synaptic
transmission
in
the
central
nervous
system
.

The
findings
presented
here
provide
the
first
detailed
approach
on
the
different
effects
of
crambescin
and
crambescidin
compounds
in
voltage-gated
sodium
,
potassium
,
and
calcium
channels
in
neurons
and
thus
provide
a
basis
for
future
studies
.

Advanced
glycation
end-products
(
AGEs
)
play
a
pivotal
role
in
the
development
of
diabetic
complications
by
inducing
inflammation
.

We
previously
reported
that
the
fresh
roots
of
Rehmannia
glutinosa
Libosch
.

,
which
have
been
used
for
the
treatment
of
diabetes
in
traditional
Korean
medicine
,
also
have
the
potential
to
suppress
AGE-mediated
inflammatory
response
in
THP-1
cells
.

In
the
present
study
,
we
isolated
catalpol
from
R
.

glutinosa
,
and
examined
whether
it
has
anti-inflammatory
effects
on
AGE-stimulated
THP-1
cells
.

Catalpol
reduced
the
expression
of
pro-inflammatory
mediates
,
such
as
monocyte
chemotactic
protein-1
(
MCP-1
)
,
tumor
necrosis
factor-α
(
TNF-α
)
,
inducible
NO
synthase
(
iNOS
)
,
and
receptor
for
AGE
(
RAGE
)
.

Promoter
and
electromobility
shift
assays
showed
that
transcriptional
activation
of
NF-κB
was
significantly
reduced
by
catalpol
treatment
,
while
AP-1
was
not
.

Catalpol
also
suppressed
AGE-induced
phosphorylation
of
mitogen
activated
protein
(
MAP
)
kinases
,
degradation
of
IκBα
and
the
nuclear
localization
of
NF-κB
.

Moreover
,
the
production
of
intracellular
reactive
oxygen
species
(
ROS
)
elicited
by
AGE
was
also
suppressed
by
catalpol
treatment
,
through
dual
action
of
reducing
ROS
itself
and
inhibiting
NADPH
oxidase
activity
.

Our
findings
indicate
that
catalpol
suppresses
AGE-mediated
inflammation
by
inhibiting
ROS
production
and
NF-κB
activity
.

We
suggest
that
catalpol
,
a
major
constituent
of
the
fresh
roots
of
R

glutinosa
,
contributes
to
the
prevention
of

Carnitine
acyltransferases
are
a
family
of
ubiquitous
enzymes
that
play
a
pivotal
role
in
cellular
energy
metabolism
.

We
report
here
the
x-ray
structure
of
human
carnitine
acetyltransferase
to
a
1
.
6-A
resolution
.

This
structure
reveals
a
monomeric
protein
of
two
equally
sized
alpha
/
beta
domains
.

Each
domain
is
shown
to
have
a
partially
similar
fold
to
other
known
but
oligomeric
enzymes
that
are
also
involved
in
group-transfer
reactions
.

The
unique
monomeric
arrangement
of
the
two
domains
constitutes
a
central
narrow
active
site
tunnel
,
indicating
a
likely
universal
feature
for
all
members
of
the
carnitine
acyltransferase
family
.

Superimposition
of
the
substrate
complex
of
a
related
protein
,
dihydrolipoyl
trans-acetylase
,
reveals
that
both
substrates
localize
to
the
active
site
tunnel
of
human
carnitine
acetyltransferase
,
suggesting
the
location
of
the
ligand
binding
sites
for
carnitine
and
coenzyme
A
.

Most
significantly
,
this
structure
provides
critical
insights
into
the

Nonalcoholic
fatty
liver
disease
(
NAFLD
)
is
considered
the
most
common
liver
disorder
in
the
Western
world
.

It
is
commonly
associated
with
insulin
resistance
,
obesity
,
dyslipidaemia
,
type
2
diabetes
mellitus
(
T2DM
)
and
cardiovascular
disease
.

Nonalcoholic
steatohepatitis
(
NASH
)
is
characterized
by
steatosis
with
necroinflammation
and
eventual
fibrosis
,
which
can
lead
to
end-stage
liver
disease
and
hepatocellular
carcinoma
.

Its
pathogenesis
is
complex
,
and
involves
a
state
of
'lipotoxicity'
in
which
insulin
resistance
,
with
increased
free
fatty
acid
release
from
adipose
tissue
to
the
liver
,
play
a
key
role
in
the
onset
of
a
'lipotoxic
liver
disease'
and
its
progression
to
NASH
.

The
diagnosis
of
NASH
is
challenging
,
as
most
affected
patients
are
symptom
free
and
the
role
of
routine
screening
is
not
clearly
established
.

A
complete
medical
history
is
important
to
rule
out
other
causes
of
fatty
liver
disease
(
alcohol
abuse
,
medications
,
other
)
.

Plasma
aminotransferase
levels
and
liver
ultrasound
are
helpful
in
the
diagnosis
of
NAFLD
/
NASH
,
but
a
liver
biopsy
is
often
required
for
a
definitive
diagnosis
.

However
,
there
is
an
active
search
for
plasma
biomarkers
and
imaging
techniques
that
may
non-invasively
aid
in
the
diagnosis
.

The
treatment
of
NASH
requires
a
multifaceted
approach
.

The
goal
is
to
reverse
obesity-associated
lipotoxicity
and
insulin
resistance
via
lifestyle
intervention
.

Although
there
is
no
pharmacological
agent
approved
for
the
treatment
of
NAFLD
,
vitamin
E
(
in
patients
without
T2DM
)
and
the
thiazolidinedione
pioglitazone
(
in
patients
with
and
without
T2DM
)
have
shown
the
most
consistent
results
in
randomized
controlled
trials
.

This
review
concentrates
on
our
current
understanding
of
the
disease
,
with
a
focus
on
the
existing
therapeutic
approaches
and
potential
future
pharmacological
developments
for
NAFLD
and
NASH
.

have
been

The

over
a
period

.

This
super-stability
is
attributed
to
the
nanosized
confinement
effect
of
ultrafine
nanocrystals
.

The
magnetism
measurements
showed
that
the
β-W
nanocrystals
have
weak

properties
at

K
,
which
may
arise
from

These
findings
provided

The
jerboa
is
a
semi-desert
rodent
,
in
which
reproductive
activity
depends
on
the
seasons
,
being
sexually
active
in
the
spring-summer
.

The
present
study
aimed
to
determine
whether
the
expression
of
two
RF-amide
peptides
recently
described
to
regulate
gonadotrophin-releasing
hormone
neurone
activity
,
kisspeptin
(
Kp
)
and
RF-amide-related
peptide
(
RFRP
)
-3
,
displays
seasonal
variation
in
jerboa
.

Kp
and
/
or
RFRP-3
immunoreactivity
was
investigated
in
the
hypothalamus
of
jerboas
captured
in
the
field
of
the
Middle
Atlas
mountain
(
Morocco
)
,
either
in
the
spring
or
autumn
.

As
in
other
rodents
,
the
Kp-immunoreactive
(
-IR
)
neurones
were
found
in
the
anteroventro-periventricular
and
arcuate
nuclei
.

RFRP-3
neurones
were
noted
within
the
dorso
/
ventromedial
hypothalamus
.

A
marked
sexual
dimorphism
in
the
expression
of
Kp
(
but
not
RFRP-3
)
was
observed
.

The
number
of
Kp-IR
neurones
was
nine-fold
higher
,
and
the
density
of
Kp-IR
fibres
and
terminal-like
elements
in
the
median
eminence
was
two-fold
higher
in
females
than
in
males
.

Furthermore
,
a
significant
seasonal
variation
in
peptide
expression
was
obtained
with
an
increase
in
both
Kp-
and
RFRP-3-IR
cell
bodies
in
sexually
active
male
jerboas
captured
in
the
spring
compared
to
sexually
inactive
autumn
animals
.

In
the
arcuate
nucleus
,
the
level
of
Kp-IR
cells
and
fibres
was
significant
higher
during
the
sexually
active
period
in
the
spring
than
during
the
autumnal
sexual
quiescence
.

Similarly
,
the
number
of
RFRP-3-IR
neurones
in
the
ventro
/
dorsomedial
hypothalamus
was
approximately
three-fold
higher
in
sexually
active
jerboa
captured
in
the
spring
compared
to
sexually
inactive
autumn
animals
.

Altogether
,
the
present
study
reports
the
distribution
of
Kp
and
RFRP-3
neurones
in
the
hypothalamus
of
a
desert
species
and
reveals
a
seasonal
difference
in
their
expression
that
correlates
with
sexual
activity
.

These
findings
suggest
that
these
two
RF-amide
peptides
may
act
in
concert
to
synchronise
the
gonadotrophic
activity
of
jerboas
with
the
seasons
.

Evidence
has
accumulated
in
the
last
few
years
that
the
expression
of
the
microsomal
/
peroxidase
antigen
(
M
/
TPO-Ag
)
in
thyroid
cells
is
induced
by
TSH
,
through
pathways
which
involve
intracellular
cAMP
accumulation
and
protein
synthesis
.

These
data
have
been
found
true
in
any
thyroid
system
studied
so
far
,
both
in
terms
of
immunologic
and
enzymatic
activity
of
TPO
.

TSH
and
cAMP
also
increase
the
levels
of
the
specific
mRNA
for
TPO
in
thyroid
cells
from
different
species
.

Whether
this
phenomenon
is
due
to
a
direct
transcriptional
regulation
of
the
TPO
gene
,
as
shown
in
dog
thyroid
cells
,
or
to
posttranscriptional
effects
,
as
it
would
appear
in
FRTL-5
cells
,
remains
to
be
clarified
by
future
experiments
.

Thyroid
stimulating
antibody
(
TSAb
)
of
Graves'
disease
also
stimulates
the
expression
of
M
/
TPO-Ag
.

This
finding
gives
further
support
to
the
relevance
of
TSAb
in
the
pathogenesis
of
hyperthyroidism
and
explains
the
well
known
observation
that
the
"microsomal"
antigen
is
particularly
abundant
in
glands
of
Graves'
patients
.

The
modulation
of
M
/
TPO-Ag
surface
expression
by
TSH
can
explain
the
decrease
of
circulating
anti-MAb
observed
during
L-thyroxine
therapy
in
hypothyroid
patients
with
Hashimoto's
thyroiditis
.

Other
agents
,
such
as
methimazole
and
sodium
iodide
,
which
influence
thyroid
cell
function
,
do
not
directly
interfere
with
the
expression
of
M
/
TPO-Ag
.

Cytokines
,
such
as
gamma-interferon
,
interleukin-1
,
and
interleukin-6
have
been
shown
to
inhibit
the
TSH-induced
increase
of
TPO
mRNA
,
but
further
investigations
are
required
to
elucidate
the
exact
role
of
cytokines
in
the
regulation
of
M
/
TPO-Ag
expression
.
Consumption
of
coffee
is
associated
with
reduced
risk
of
Parkinson's
disease
(
PD
)
,
an
effect
that
has
largely
been
attributed
to
caffeine
.

However
,
coffee
contains
numerous
components
that
may
also
be
neuroprotective
.

One
of
these
compounds
is
eicosanoyl-5-hydroxytryptamide
(
EHT
)
,
which
ameliorates
the
phenotype
of
α-synuclein
transgenic
mice
associated
with
decreased
protein
aggregation
and
phosphorylation
,
improved
neuronal
integrity
and
reduced
neuroinflammation
.

Here
,
we
sought
to
investigate
if
EHT
has
an
effect
in
the
MPTP
model
of
PD
.

Mice
fed
a
diet
containing
EHT
for
four
weeks
exhibited
dose-dependent
preservation
of
nigral
dopaminergic
neurons
following
MPTP
challenge
compared
to
animals
given
control
feed
.

Reductions
in
striatal
dopamine
and
tyrosine
hydroxylase
content
were
also
less
pronounced
with
EHT
treatment
.

The
neuroinflammatory
response
to
MPTP
was
markedly
attenuated
,
and
indices
of
oxidative
stress
and
JNK
activation
were
significantly
prevented
with
EHT
.

In
cultured
primary
microglia
and
astrocytes
,
EHT
had
a
direct
anti-inflammatory
effect
demonstrated
by
repression
of
lipopolysaccharide-induced
NFκB
activation
,
iNOS
induction
,
and
nitric
oxide
production
.

EHT
also
exhibited
a
robust
anti-oxidant
activity
in
vitro
.

Additionally
,
in
SH-SY5Y
cells
,
MPP
(
+
)
-induced
demethylation
of
phosphoprotein
phosphatase
2A
(
PP2A
)
,
the
master
regulator
of
the
cellular
phosphoregulatory
network
,
and
cytotoxicity
were
ameliorated
by
EHT
.

These
findings
indicate
that
the
neuroprotective
effect
of
EHT
against
MPTP
is
through
several
mechanisms
including
its
anti-inflammatory
and
antioxidant
activities
as
well
as
its
ability
to
modulate
the
methylation
and
hence
activity
of
PP2A
.

Our
data
,
therefore
,
reveal
a
strong
beneficial
effect
of
a
novel
component
of
coffee
in

PURPOSE
:
The
pipecolinate
derivative
VX-710
(
biricodar;
Incel
)
is
a
clinically
applicable
modulator
of
P-glycoprotein
(
Pgp
)
and
multidrug

protein
(
MRP-1
)
;
we
studied
its
activity
against
the
third

(
MDR
)

,
breast

studied
in

.

RESULTS
:
In
8226
/
Dox6
cells
(
Pgp
)
,
VX-710
increased
mitoxantrone
and
daunorubicin
uptake
by
55
and
100%
,
respectively
,
increased
their

,
and
increased
their

,
respectively
.

In

Adr
cells
(

,
VX-710
increased
mitoxantrone
and
daunorubicin
uptake
by
43
and
130%
,
increased
their

by
90

.

In

)
,
VX-710
increased
mitoxantrone
uptake

by
60
and
40%
,
respectively
,
and
increased

2
.
4-fold
.

VX-710
increased
daunorubicin
uptake
and
retention
by
only
10%
in
8226
/
MR20
cells
,
consistent
with
the
fact
that
daunorubicin
is
not
a
substrate
for
BCRP
(
R482
)
,
but
,
nevertheless
,
it
increased
daunorubicin
cytotoxicity
3
.
6-fold
,
and
this
increase
was
not
associated
with
intracellular
drug
redistribution
.

VX-710
had
little
effect
on
uptake
,
retention
,
or
cytotoxicity
of
mitoxantrone
,
daunorubicin
,
doxorubicin
,
topotecan
,
or
SN38
in

CONCLUSIONS
:
VX-710
modulates
Pgp
,
MRP-1
,
and
BCRP
(
R482
)
,
and
has
potential
as
a
clinical

as
the
acute

are

An

the

the

In

confirmed
that
knocking
out
the

subunit
of
the
K
(

)
channels
increases
ischemic

,
and
overexpression
of
the
Kir6

2
subunit
reduces
neuronal
injury
from
ischemic
insults
.

These
findings
provide
the
basis
for
a
practical
strategy
whereby
activation
of
endogenous
K
(

channels
reduces
cellular
damage
resulting
from
cerebral
ischemic
stroke
.

K

may
prove
to
be

PKMζ
is
an
autonomously
active
,
atypical
protein
kinase
C
(
aPKC
)
isoform
that
is
both
necessary
and
sufficient
for
maintaining
long-term
potentiation
(
LTP
)
and
long-term
memory
.

The
myristoylated
ζ-pseudosubstrate
peptide
,
ZIP
,
potently
inhibits
PKMζ
biochemically
in
vitro
,
within
cultured
cells
,
and
within
neurons
in
hippocampal
slices
,
and
reverses
LTP
maintenance
and
erases
long-term
memory
storage
.

A
recent
study
(
Wu-Zhang
et
al
.

,
2012
)
,
however
,
suggested
ZIP
was
not
effective
on
a
PKMζ
fusion
protein
overexpressed
in
cultured
cells
.

Chelerythrine
,
a
redox-sensitive
PKC
inhibitor
that
inhibits
PKMζ
and
disrupts
LTP
maintenance
and
memory
storage
,
was
also
reported
by
Wu-Zhang
et
al
.

(
2012
)
not
to
inhibit
the
expressed
PKMζ
fusion
protein
.

However
,
the
efficacy
of
inhibitors
on
endogenous
enzymes
in
cells
may
not
be
adequately
assessed
in
expression
systems
in
which
levels
of
expression
of
exogenous
enzymes
greatly
exceed
those
of
endogenous
enzymes
.

Thus
,
we
show
,
biochemically
,
that
when
PKMζ
reaches
a
level
beyond
that
necessary
for
substrate
phosphorylation
such
that
much
of
the
enzyme
is
excess
or
'spare'
kinase
,
ZIP
and
chelerythrine
do
not
effectively
block
substrate
phosphorylation
.

We
also
show
that
the
cellular
overexpression
techniques
used
by
Wu-Zhang
et
al
.

(
2012
)
increase
kinase
levels
~30-40
fold
above
normal
levels
in
transfected
cells
.

Using
a
mathematical
model
we
show
that
at
such
level
of
overexpression
,
standard
concentrations
of
inhibitor
should
have
no
noticeable
effect
.

Furthermore
,
we
demonstrate
the
standard
concentrations
of
ZIP
,
but
not
scrambled
ZIP
,
inhibit
the
ability
of
PKMζ
to
potentiate
AMPAR
responses
at
postsynaptic
sites
,
the
physiological
function
of
the
kinase
.

Wu-Zhang
et
al
.

(
2012
)
had
also
claimed
that
staurosporine
,
a
general
kinase
inhibitor
that
does
not
effectively
inhibit
PKMζ
biochemically
in
vitro
,
nonetheless
indirectly
blocked
the
PKMζ
fusion
protein
overexpressed
in
cultured
cells
by
inhibiting
phosphoinositide-dependent
protein
kinase-1
(
PDK1
)
.

However
,
here
we
show
that
staurosporine
does
not
affect
PDK1
phosphorylation
of
the
endogenous
PKMζ
in
hippocampal
slices
.

Thus
,
the
biochemical
in
vitro
effects
of
PKMζ
inhibitors
correspond
with
their
intracellular
effects
,
and
ZIP
and
chelerythrine
,
together
with
scrambled
ZIP
and
staurosporine
as
controls
,
are
effective
tools
to
examine
the
function
of
PKMζ
in
neurons
.

that
at

,
H

was
able
to
inhibit

induced

through

of

.

Pretreatment
with
H
(
2
)
S
or
NaHS
significantly
inhibited
LPS-induced
iNOS
expression
and
NO
production
.

Moreover
,
NO
production
in
LPS-stimulated
macrophages
that
are
expressing
CSE
mRNA
was
significantly
reduced
by
the
addition
of
L-Cys

,
but
enhanced
by

While

reversed
the

,

produced
the

of

.

In
addition

Interestingly
,
the
inhibitory

(

S
on
NF-kappaB
activation
was
reversed
by
the
transient
transfection
with

was
mimicked
by

or
treatment
with

CO
treatment
also
inhibited

via
its
inactivation
of

Collectively
,
our
results
suggest
that
H

can
inhibit

Acetazolamide

is
an
carbonic
anhydrase
inhibitor
,
which
has
been
used
in
the
treatment
of
seizures
,
mountain
sickness
and
glaucoma
.

Memory
impairment
by
AZ
has
been
reported
in
patient
interviews;
however
,
the
related
mechanism
is
unclear
.

We
applied
two
fear
conditioning
paradigms
,
shuttle
avoidance
and
passive
avoidance
,
in
both
rats
and
mice
to
investigate
this
clinical
anecdote
.

Adult
Wistar
rats
receiving
AZ
1
h
before
the
shuttle
avoidance
test
showed
decreased
avoidance
rates
,
especially
at
high
dosage
.

Adult
ICR
mice
receiving
AZ
both
before
and
after
acquisition
trials
showed
the
decreased
step-through
latencies
during
the
passive
avoidance
test
.

This
impairment
of
fear
memory
was
corroborated
with
decreased
LTP
by
AZ
in
the
amygdala
.

AZ
only
inhibited
fear
conditioning-induced
ERK
phosphorylation
and
had
no
effect
on
Akt
phosphorylation
.

In
conclusion
,
our
study
confirmed
the
adverse
cognitive
effect
of
AZ
in
animal
and
electrophysiological
studies
.

In
clinical
practice
,
clinicians
should
be
aware
of
this
side
effect
in
patients
taking
AZ
.

In
addition
,
this
inhibition
of
fear
memory
by
AZ
could
potentially
be
applied
to
patients
with

.
The
initial
excitement
and
countless
efforts
to
find
a
pharmacological
agent
that
disrupts
the
excitotoxic
pathway
of
ischemic
neuronal
death
have
only
led
to
disappointing
clinical
trials
.

Currently
,
a
thrombolytic
agent
called
recombinant
tissue
plasminogen
activator
(
rt-PA
)
is
the
only
pharmacological
treatment
available
for
patients
with
acute
ischemic
stroke
in
most
countries
.

Even
though
its
efficacy
has
been
confirmed
repeatedly
,
rt-PA
is
considerably
underused
due
to
reasons
including
a
short
therapeutic
window
and
repeated
complications
associated
with
its
use
.

A
search
for
alternative
mechanisms
that
may
operate
dependently
or
independently
with
the
well-established
excitotoxic
mechanism
has
led
researchers
to
the
discovery
of
newly
described
non-glutamate
mechanisms
.

Among
the
latter
,
transient
receptor
potential
melastatin
7
(
TRPM7
)
is
one
of
the
important
nonglutamate
mechanisms
in
stroke
,
which
has
been
evaluated
in
both
in-vitro
and
in-vivo
.

In
this
review
,
we
will
discuss
the
current
state
of
pharmacological
treatments
of
ischemic
stroke
and
provide
evidence
that
TRPM7
is
a
promising
therapeutic
target
of
stroke
.
BACKGROUND
:
We
previously
found
that
S100P
,
a
member
of
the
S100
protein
family
,
is
expressed
in
more
than
90%
of
pancreatic
tumors
and
is
associated
with
tumor
growth
and
invasion
.

In
the
current
study
,
we
investigated
the
ability
of
the
antiallergy
drug
,
cromolyn
,
to
block
S100P
function
.

METHODS
:
Interactions
between
cromolyn
and
S100P
were
investigated
using
a
drug
affinity
column
and
by
examining
cromolyn's
effects
on
coimmunoprecipitation
of
S100P
and
receptor
for
advanced
glycation
end-products
(
RAGE
)
.

The
effects
of
cromolyn
on
cell
growth
,
invasion
,
and
nuclear
factor-kappaB
(
NFkappaB
)
activity
of
pancreatic
cancer
cells
with
(
BxPC-3
and
MPanc-96
)
and
without
(
Panc-1
)
endogenous
S100P
were
investigated
by
cell
proliferation
assay
,
by
cell
invasion
assay
,
and
by
luciferase
reporter
gene
assay
,
respectively
.

The
effects
of
cromolyn
on
tumor
growth
in
vivo
were
investigated
in
three
orthotopic
models
(
n
=
20
mice
per
model
)
by
administration
of
cromolyn
(
5
mg
/
kg
body
weight
,
daily
)
with
and
without
gemcitabine
(
125
mg
/
kg
body
weight
,
biweekly
)
,
the
drug
currently
used
to
treat
pancreatic
cancer
.

Tumor
growth
was
assayed
by
reporter
gene
expression
.

All
statistical
tests
were
two-sided
.

The
identification
of
new
molecular
components
of
the
DNA

opens
novel
avenues
to
enhance
the
efficacy
of
chemotherapeutic

.

High-mobility

protein
1
(
HMGB1
)
is
a
DNA
damage
sensor
responsive
to
the
incorporation
of
nonnatural
nucleosides
into
DNA;
several
nuclear
and
cytosolic
proteins
are
functionally
integrated
with
HMGB1
in
the
context
of
DNA
damage
response
.

The
functional
role
of
HMGB1
and
HMGB1-associated
proteins
(
high-mobility
group
protein
B2
,
HMGB2;
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate

,

,

and

)
in
DNA
damage
response
was
assessed
in
human
carcinoma
cells
A549
and
UO31
by
transient
knockdown
with
short
interfering
RNAs
.

Using
the
cell
proliferation
assay
,
we
found
that
knockdown
of
HMGB1-associated
proteins
resulted
in
8-fold
to
50-fold
decreased
chemosensitivity
of
A549
cells
to
cytarabine
.

Western
blot
analysis
and
immunofluorescent
microscopy
were
used
to
evaluate
genotoxic
stress
markers
in
knocked-down
cancer
cells
after
24
to
72
hours
of
incubation
with
1
micromol
/
L
of
cytarabine
.

Our
results
dissect
the
roles
of
HMGB1-associated
proteins
in
DNA
damage
response
:
HMGB1
and
HMGB2
facilitate
p53
phosphorylation
after
exposure
to
genotoxic
stress
,
and
PDIA3
has
been
found
essential
for
H2AX
phosphorylation
(
no
gamma-H2AX
accumulated
after
24-72
hours
of
incubation
with
1
micromol
/
L
of
cytarabine
in
PDIA3
knockdown
cells
)
.

We
conclude
that
phosphorylation
of
p53
and
phosphorylation
of
H2AX
occur
in
two
distinct
branches
of
the
DNA
damage
response
.

These
findings
identify
new
molecular
components
of
the
DNA
damage
signaling
cascade
and
provide
novel
promising
targets
for
chemotherapeutic
intervention

Pimozide

agent
also
used
to
treat

.

Pimozide
can
cause
acquired
long
QT
syndrome
and
ventricular
arrhythmias
.

To
elucidate
the
mechanism
behind
these
clinical
findings
,
we
examined
the
effects
of
pimozide
on
the
cloned
human
cardiac
K
(
+
)
channels
HERG
(
human
ether-a-go-go-related

(

)
and
KvLQT1
/
minK
(
slow
component
of

)
.

Using
patch
clamp
electrophysiology
,
we
found
that
pimozide
was
a
potent
inhibitor
of
HERG
displaying
an
IC
(
50
)
value
of
18
nM
.

In
contrast
,
pimozide
(
10
microM
)
was
a
weak
inhibitor
of
KvLQT1
/
minK
and
Kv1
.
5
.

We
conclude
that
pimozide
is
a
specific
,
high
affinity
antagonist
of
HERG
,
and
that
this
interaction
leads
to
prolongation
of
cardiac
repolarization
.
Here
,
we
report
for
the
first
time
in
vitro
reconstitution
of
the
respiratory
supercomplexes
from
individual
complexes
III
and
IV
.

Complexes
III
and
IV
were
purified
from
Saccharomyces
cerevisiae
mitochondria
.

Complex
III
contained
eight
molecules
of
cardiolipin
,
and
complex
IV
contained
two
molecules
of
cardiolipin
,
as
determined
by
electrospray
ionization-mass
spectrometry
.

Complex
IV
also
contained
Rcf1p
.

No
supercomplexes
were
formed
upon
mixing
of
the
purified
complexes
,
and
low
amounts
of
the
supercomplex
trimer
III
(
2
)
IV
(
1
)
were
formed
after
reconstitution
into
proteoliposomes
containing
only
phosphatidylcholine
and
phosphatidylethanolamine
.

Further
addition
of
cardiolipin
to
the
proteoliposome
reconstitution
mixture
resulted
in
distinct
formation
of
both
the
III
(
2
)
IV
(
1
)
supercomplex
trimer
and
III
(
2
)
IV
(
2
)
supercomplex
tetramer
.

No
other
anionic
phospholipid
was
as
effective
as
cardiolipin
in
supporting
tetramer
formation
.

Phospholipase
treatment
of
complex
IV
prevented
trimer
formation
in
the
absence
of
cardiolipin
.

Both
trimer
and
tetramer
formations
were
restored
by
cardiolipin
.

Analysis
of
the
reconstituted
tetramer
by
single
particle
electron
microscopy
confirmed
native
organization
of
individual
complexes
within
the
supercomplex
.

In
conclusion
,
although
some
trimer
formation
occurred
dependent
only
on
tightly
bound
cardiolipin
,
tetramer
formation
required
additional
cardiolipin
.

This
is
consistent
with
the
high
cardiolipin
content
in
the
native
tetramer
.

The
dependence
on
cardiolipin
for
supercomplex
formation
suggests
that
changes
in
cardiolipin
levels
resulting
from
changes
in
physiological
conditions
may
control
the
equilibrium
between
individual
respiratory
complexes
and
supercomplexes
in
vivo

IL-6
is
a
multi-functional
cytokine
that
plays
an
important
role
in
normal
biologic
homeostasis
and
disease
pathogenesis
.

Retinoids
are
vitamin
A
analogs
that
regulate
the
function
of
a
wide
variety
of
inflammatory
and
structural
cells
.

To
further
understand
the
biology
of
retinoids
and
IL-6
we
determined
whether
all-trans-retinoic
acid
(
RA
)
and
other
retinoids
regulate
lung
fibroblast
IL-6
production
.

RA
did
not
stimulate
fibroblast
IL-6
production
.

Instead
,
it
inhibited
the
production
of
IL-6
by
IL-1-stimulated
cells
.

This
effect
was
dose-dependent
with
an
IC50
of
10
(
-7
)
M
RA
and
significant
inhibition
being
noted
with
doses
of
RA
as
low
as
10
(
-8
)
M
.

These
inhibitory
effects
could
not
be
explained
by
cytotoxicity
or
a
shift
in
the
kinetics
of
IL-6
production
.

They
also
did
not
appear
to
involve
alterations
in
the
early
events
in
IL-1-induced
IL-6
production
,
because
RA
inhibited
IL-6
production
even
when
added
6
h
after
IL-1
and
RA
did
not
inhibit
IL-1
binding
to
cell
surface
IL-1
receptors
.

RA
inhibition
of
IL-6
protein
production
was
associated
with
a
comparable
decrease
in
IL-6
mRNA
accumulation
and
gene
transcription
.

13-cis-retinoic
acid
,
retinol
,
retinaldehyde
,
all-trans
etretin
,
Ro
13-6298
,
and
9-cis
retinoic
acid
also
inhibited
IL-1-induced
IL-6
production
.

However
,
4-hydroxyphenyl
retinamide
and
etretinate
did
not
share
this
property
.

The
inhibitory
effects
of
these
analogues
may
be
mediated
by
nuclear
retinoic
acid
receptors
as
mRNA
encoding
RAR-alpha
,
RAR-gamma
,
and
RXR-alpha
were
present
,
and
RAR-beta
was
induced
by
RA
in
human
lung
fibroblasts
.

These
studies
demonstrate
that
RA
and
other
retinoid
analogs
inhibit
IL-1-induced
IL-6
production
and
that
this
effect
is
analog-specific
and
,
at
least
partially
,
transcriptionally
mediated
.
The
suppressors
of
cytokine
signaling
(
SOCS
)
proteins
inhibit
cytokine
action
by
direct
interaction
with
Janus
kinases
or
activated
cytokine
receptors
.

In
addition
to
the
N-terminal
and
Src
homology
2
domains
that
mediate
these
interactions
,
SOCS
proteins
contain
a
C-terminal
SOCS
box
.

DNA
data
base
searches
have
identified
a
number
of
other
protein
families
that
possess
a
SOCS
box
,
of
which
the
ankyrin
repeat
and
SOCS
box-containing
(
Asb
)
proteins
constitute
the
largest
.

Although
it
is
known
that
the
SOCS
proteins
are
involved
in
the
negative
regulation
of
cytokine
signaling
,
the
biological
and
biochemical
functions
of
the
Asbs
are
largely
undefined
.

Using
a
proteomics
approach
,
we
demonstrate
that
creatine
kinase
B
(
CKB
)
interacts
with
Asb-9
in
a
specific
,
SOCS
box-independent
manner
.

This
interaction
increases
the
polyubiquitylation
of
CKB
and
decreases
total
CKB
levels
within
the
cell
.

The
targeting
of
CKB
for
degradation
by
Asb-9
was
primarily
SOCS
box-dependent
and
suggests
that
Asb-9
acts
as
a
specific
ubiquitin
ligase
regulating
levels
of
this
evolutionarily
conserved
enzyme
.

has
been
shown
to
decrease

concentrations
through
bacterial

.

Bioreduction
also
changed
the

,
altering
the
mobility
of
several
other
redox-sensitive
elements
present
in
the

,
including
iron
,

,
and
arsenic
.

Following
acetate
amendment
at
the
site
,
elevated
concentrations

in
the
groundwater
were
observed
.

Ion
chromatography-inductively
coupled

was
used
to
determine
the

Upgradient

unexposed

showed
low
levels
of
arsenic
(
≈1
μM
)
,
with
greater
than
90%
as

(
As

)
and
a
small
amount
of
arsenite
(
As

)
.

Downgradient
acetate-stimulated
water
samples
had
much
higher
levels
of
arsenic
(
up
to
8
μM
)
,
and
4
additional
thioarsenic
species
were
present
under
sulfate-reducing
conditions
.

These
thioarsenic
species
demonstrate
a
strong
correlation
between
arsenic
release
and
sulfide
concentrations
in
groundwater
,
and
their
formation
may
explain
the
elevated

arsenic
concentrations
.

patients
with
blood
eosinophilia
has
transformed
the
diagnostic
as
well
as
treatment
approach
to
eosinophilic
disorders
.

Primary
(
i
.

e
.

nonreactive
)
eosinophilia
is
considered
either
"clonal"
or
"idiopathic"
based
on
the
presence
or
absence
,
respectively
,
of
either
a
molecular
or
bone
marrow
histological
evidence
for
a
myeloid
neoplasm
.

Clonal
eosinophilia
might
accompany
a
spectrum
of
clinicopathological
entities
,
the
minority
of
whom
are
molecularly
characterized;
Fip1-like-1-platelet-derived
growth
factor
receptor
alpha
(
FIP1L1-PDGFRA
(
+
)
)
systemic
mastocytosis
,
platelet-derived
growth
factor
receptor
beta
(
PDGFRB
)
-rearranged
atypical
myeloproliferative
disorder
,
chronic
myeloid
leukemia
,
and
the
8p11
syndrome
that
is
associated
with
fibroblast
growth
factor
receptor
1
(
FGFR1
)
rearrangement
.

Hypereosinophilic
syndrome
(
HES
)
is
a
subcategory
of
idiopathic
eosinophilia
and
is
characterized
by
an
absolute
eosinophil
count
of
>
or
=
1
.
5
x
10
(
9
)
/
l
for
at
least
6
months
as
well
as
eosinophil-mediated
tissue
damage
.

At
present
,
a
working
diagnosis
of
primary
eosinophilia
mandates
a
bone
marrow
examination
,
karyotype
analysis
,
and
additional
molecular
studies
in
order
to
provide
the
patient
with
accurate
prognostic
information
as
well
as
select
appropriate
therapy
.

For
example
,
the
presence
of
either
PDGFRA
or
PDGFRB
mutations
warrants
the
use
of
imatinib
in
clonal
eosinophilia
.

In
HES
,
prednisone
,
hydroxyurea
,
and
interferon-alpha
constitute
first-line
therapy
,
whereas
imatinib
,
cladribine
,
and
monoclonal
antibodies
to
either
interleukin-5
(
mepolizumab
)
or
CD52
(
alemtuzumab
)
are
considered
investigational
.

Allogeneic
transplantation
offers
a
viable
treatment
option
for
drug-refractory
cases
.

Kinetic
studies
of
tetrameric
recombinant
human
tyrosine
hydroxylase
isoform
1
(
hTH1
)
have
revealed
properties
so
far
not
reported
for
this
enzyme
.

Firstly
,
with
the
natural
cofactor
(
6R
)
-Lerythro-5
,
6
,
7
,
8-tetrahydrobiopterin
(
H4biopterin
)
a
time-dependent
change
(
burst
)
in
enzyme
activity
was
observed
,
with
a
half-time
of
about
20
s
for
the
kinetic
transient
.

Secondly
,
nonhyperbolic
saturation
behaviour
was
found
for
H4biopterin
with
a
pronounced
negative
cooperativity
(

.

On
phosphorylation
of
Ser40
by
protein
kinase
A
,
the
affinity
for
H4biopterin
increased
(
[
S
]
0
.
5
=
11
+
/
-
2
microM
)
and
the
negative
cooperativity
was
amplified
(
h
=
0
.
27
+
/
-
0
.
03
)
.

The
dimeric
C-terminal
deletion
mutant
(
Delta473-528
)
of
hTH1
also
showed
negative
cooperativity
of
H4biopterin
binding
(
h
=
0
.
4
)
.

Cooperativity
was
not
observed
with
the
cofactor
analogues
6-methyl-5
,
6
,
7
,
8-tetrahydropterin
(
h
=
0
.
9

/
-

.

Km
=

.

/

microM
)
and
3-methyl-5
,
6
,
7
,
8-tetrahydropterin
(
H43-methyl-pterin
)
(
h
=
1
.
0
+
/
-
0
.
1;
Km
=
687
+
/
-
50
microM
)
.

In
the
presence
of
1
mM
H43-methyl-pterin
,
used
as
a
competitive
cofactor
analogue
to
BH4
,
hyperbolic
saturation
curves
were
also
found
for
H4biopterin
(
h
=
1
.
0
)
,
thus
confirming
the
genuine
nature
of
the
kinetic
negative
cooperativity
.

This
cooperativity
was
confirmed
by
real-time
biospecific
interaction
analysis
by
surface
plasmon
resonance
detection
.

The
equilibrium
binding
of
H4biopterin
to
the
immobilized
iron-free
apoenzyme
results
in
a
saturable
positive
resonance
unit
(
DeltaRU
)
response
with
negative
cooperativity
(
h
=
0
.
52-0
.
56
)
.

Infrared
spectroscopic
studies
revealed
a
reduced
thermal
stability
both
of
the
apo-and
the
holo-hTH1
on
binding
of
H4biopterin
and
Lerythro-dihydrobiopterin
(
H2biopterin
)
.

Moreover
,
the
ligand-bound
forms
of
the
enzyme
also
showed
a
decreased
resistance
to
limited
tryptic
proteolysis
.

These
findings
indicate
that
the
binding
of
H4biopterin
at
the
active
site
induces
a
destabilizing
conformational
change
in
the
enzyme
which
could
be
related
to
the
observed
negative
cooperativity
.

Thus
,
our
studies
provide
new
insight
into
the
regulation
of
TH
by
the
concentration
of
H4biopterin
which
may
have
significant
implications
for
the
physiological
regulation
of
catecholamine
biosynthesis
in
neuroendocrine
cells
.
Humans
and
other
organisms
have
adapted
to
a
24-h
solar
cycle
in
response
to
life
on
Earth
.

The
rotation
of
the
planet
on
its
axis
and
its
revolution
around
the
sun
cause
predictable
daily
and
seasonal
patterns
in
day
length
.

In
order
to
successfully
anticipate
and
adapt
to
these
patterns
in
the
environment
,
a
variety
of
biological
processes
oscillate
with
a
daily
rhythm
approximately
24
h
in
length
.

These
rhythms
arise
from
hierarchally-coupled
cellular
clocks
generated
by
positive
and
negative
transcription
factors
of
core
circadian
clock
gene
expression
.

From
these
endogenous
cellular
clocks
,
overt
rhythms
in
activity
and
patterns
in
hormone
secretion
and
other
homeostatic
processes
emerge
.

These
circadian
rhythms
in
physiology
and
behavior
can
be
organized
by
a
variety
of
cues
,
but
they
are
most
potently
entrained
by
light
.

In
recent
history
,
there
has
been
a
major
change
from
naturally
occurring
light
cycles
set
by
the
sun
,
to
artificial
and
sometimes
erratic
light
cycles
determined
by
the
use
of
electric
lighting
.

Virtually
every
individual
living
in
an
industrialized
country
experiences
light
at
night
(
LAN
)
,
but
despite
its
prevalence
,
the
biological
effects
of
such
unnatural
lighting
have
not
been
fully
considered
.

Using
female
Siberian
hamsters
(
Phodopus
sungorus
)
,
we
investigated
the
effects
of
chronic
nightly
exposure
to
dim
light
on
daily
rhythms
in
locomotor
activity
,
serum
cortisol
concentrations
,
and
brain
expression
of
circadian
clock
proteins
(
i
.

e
.

,
PER1
,
PER2
,
BMAL1
)
.

Although
locomotor
activity
remained
entrained
to
the
light
cycle
,
the
diurnal
fluctuation
of
cortisol
concentrations
was
blunted
and
the
expression
patterns
of
clock
proteins
in
the
SCN
and
hippocampus
were
altered
.

These
results
demonstrate
that
chronic
exposure
to
dim
LAN
can
dramatically
affect
fundamental
cellular
function
and
emergent
physiology

OBJECTIVE
:
To
analyse
fenoterol-induced
tachycardia
and
hypokalaemia
,
the
most
important
and
most
frequent
adverse
effects
of
tocolytic
therapy
with
beta
2-adrenoceptor
agonists
in
females
of
childbearing
age
.

METHODS
:
The
study
was
performed
as
a
double
blind
,
randomised
,
placebo
controlled
,
cross
over
trial
.

Seven
healthy
women
aged
22-38
y
,
received
intravenous
infusions
of
fenoterol
at
3
different
rates
within
the
therapeutic
range
for
tocolysis
(

)
and
placebo
.

The
time
courses
of
the
plasma
concentrations
of
fenoterol
and
potassium
,
and
the
heart
rate
were
analysed
with
mixed
effects
pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic
(
PKPD
)
modeling
using
NONMEM
.

RESULTS
:
The
plasma
concentration-time
course
followed
a
linear
two
compartment
model
.

Fenoterol-induced
tachycardia
was
described
by
a
linear
concentration-effect
model
with

.

The
estimated

were
78

respectively
.

Fenoterol-induced
hypokalaemia
could
be
described
by
a
physiological
indirect

model
including
feedback;
the
Estimated
basal
plasma
potassium
concentration
was

and
the
slope
factor
for
the
fenoterol-induced
relative

from
the
extracellular

was
6

.

CONCLUSION
:
The
estimated
population
parameters
permitted
calculation
of
the
expected
time
course
of
tachycardia
and
hypokalaemia
in
women
after
the
initiation
of
tocolysis
with
fenoterol
over
the
clinically
relevant
concentration
range
,
and
prediction
of
its
variability
.

Based
on

,
our
model
predicted
that
a
continuous
infusion
of

(
highest
rate
examined
)
would
increase
heart
rate
to

Cooperative

Sirtuins
are
NAD
(
+
)
-dependent
protein
deacetylases
and
are
emerging
as
molecular
targets
for
the
development
of
pharmaceuticals
to
treat
human
metabolic
and
neurological
diseases
and
cancer
.

To
date
,
several
sirtuin
inhibitors
and
activators
have
been
identified
,
but
the
structural
mechanisms
of
how
these
compounds
modulate
sirtuin
activity
have
not
yet
been
determined
.

We
identified
suramin
as
a
compound
that
binds
to
human
SIRT5
and
showed
that
it
inhibits
SIRT5
NAD
(
+
)
-dependent
deacetylase
activity
with
an
IC
(
50
)
value
of
22
microM
.

To
provide
insights
into
how
sirtuin
function
is
altered
by
inhibitors
,
we
determined
two
crystal
structures
of
SIRT5
,
one
in
complex
with
ADP-ribose
,
the
other
bound
to
suramin
.

Our
structural
studies
provide
a
view
of
a
synthetic
inhibitory
compound
in
a
sirtuin
active
site
revealing
that
suramin
binds
into
the
NAD
(
+
)
,
the
product
,
and
the
substrate-binding
site
.

Finally
,
our
structures
may
enable
the
rational
design
of
more
potent
inhibitors
.
The
most
important
group
of
antifungals
is
the
azoles
(
e
.

g
.

miconazole
)
,
which
act
by
inhibiting
lanosterol
demethylase
in
the
sterol
biosynthesis
pathway
.

Azole
activity
can
be
modulated
through
structural
changes
in
lanosterol
demethylase
,
altered
expression
of
its
gene
ERG11
,
alterations
in
other
sterol
biosynthesis
enzymes
or
altered
expression
of
multidrug
transporters
.

We
present
evidence
that
azole
activity
versus
Saccharomyces
cerevisiae
is
also
modulated
by
Ca2
+
-regulated
signalling
.

(
i
)
Azole
activity
was
reduced
by
the
addition
of
Ca2
+
.

Conversely
,
azole
activity
was
enhanced
by
the
addition
of
Ca2
+
chelator
EGTA
.

(
ii
)
Three
structurally
distinct
inhibitors
(
fluphenazine
,
calmidazolium
and
a
W-7
analogue
)
of
the
Ca2
+
-binding
regulatory
protein
calmodulin
enhanced
azole
activity
.

(
iii
)
Two
structurally
distinct
inhibitors
(
cyclosporin
and
FK506
)
of
the
Ca2
+
-calmodulin-regulated
phosphatase
calcineurin
enhanced
azole
activity
.

(
iv
)
Strains
in
which
the
Ca2
+
binding
sites
of
calmodulin
were
eliminated
and
strains
in
which
the
calcineurin
subunit
genes
were
disrupted
demonstrated
enhanced
azole
sensitivity;
conversely
,
a
mutant
with
constitutively
activated
calcineurin
phosphatase
demonstrated
decreased
azole
sensitivity
.

(
v
)
CRZ1
/
TCN1
encodes
a
transcription
factor
regulated
by
calcineurin
phosphatase;
its
disruption
enhanced
azole
sensitivity
,
whereas
its
overexpression
decreased
azole
sensitivity
.

All
the
above
treatments
had
comparable
effects
on
the
activity
of
terbinafine
,
an
inhibitor
of
squalene
epoxidase
within
the
sterol
biosynthesis
pathway
,
but
had
little
or
no
effect
on
the
activity
of
drugs
with
unrelated
targets
.

(
vi
)
Treatment
of
S
.

cerevisiae
with
azole
or
terbinafine
resulted
in
transcriptional
upregulation
of
genes
FKS2
and
PMR1
known
to
be
Ca2
+
regulated
.

A
model
to
explain
the
role
of
Ca2
+
-regulated
signalling
in
azole
/
terbinafine
tolerance
is
proposed
.
The
efficacy
of
cetirizine

comparison
with
meclizine
,
another
piperazine
H1
receptor
antagonist
,
in
rat
pleurisy

by
allergen
or
autacoid
was
investigated
.

Sensitization
was
achieved
by
subcutaneous
injection
of
a
mixture
of
ovalbumin
and
aluminium
hydroxide
.

Fourteen
days
later
,
the
animals
were
challenged
with
an
intrathoracic
injection
of
ovalbumin
(
12
micrograms
/
cavity
)
,
which
caused
drastic
mast
cell
degranulation
,
followed
by
pleural
oedema
and
leucocyte
influx
.

Cetirizine
and
meclizine
(
2
.

mg

)
,
1
h
before
challenge
,
inhibited
the
exudatory
response
evoked
by
antigen
,
under
conditions
where
neutrophil
and
eosinophil
accumulation
was
affected
only
by
the
former
.

When
administered
intrathoracically
22
h
after

,
i
.

e
.

using
a
curative
approach
,
cetirizine
(
15
micrograms
/
cavity
)
drastically
reduced
the
pleural
eosinophilia
noted
24
h
post-challenge
,
indicating
that
this
drug
can
reverse
an
already
established
eosinophilia
.

Cetirizine
(
15
mg
/
kg
i
.

p
.

)
also
restored
,
to
about
39%
(
P
<
0
.

)
,
the
number
of
uninjured
mast
cells
recovered
from
the
pleural
cavity
following
allergen
stimulation
.

In
normal
rats
,
cetirizine
(
5-15
micrograms
/
cavity
)
completely
inhibited
the
pleural
exudation
elicited
by
histamine
and
only
partially
the
exudation
caused
by
5-hydroxytryptamine
or
bradykinin
,
but
was
quite
inactive
against
platelet-activating
factor
.

We
conclude
that
the
pleural
exudation
triggered
by
allergen
,
vasoactive
amines
or
bradykinin
is
clearly
sensitive
to
cetirizine
.

In
addition
,
the
ability
of
the
drug
to
interfere
with
pleural
neutrophil
or
eosinophil
mobilization
and
mast
cell
degranulation
seems
not
to
be
associated
with
its
ability
to
block
the
histamine

OBJECTIVES
:
Sleep

common
in
minimal

and
the
mechanisms
are
not
fully
elucidated
.

Dysregulated

is

CONCLUSIONS
:
In

well
as
with

The

an

trial

Coronary
heart
disease
(
CHD
)
is
the
leading
cause
of
death
worldwide
,
and
effective
treatment
of
hyperlipidaemia
can
prevent
development
of
CHD
and
significantly
reduce
the
risk
for
cardiovascular
events
and
mortality
in
this
disease
.

The
advent
of
3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl
coenzyme
A
(
HMG-CoA
)
reductase
inhibitors
(
statins
)
has
revolutionised
the
treatment
of
hyperlipidaemia
,
but
many
patients
receiving
these
drugs
still
do
not
achieve
their
therapeutic
goals
.

Rosuvastatin
(
Crestor;
formerly
ZD4522
)
is
a
new
,
potent
and
long-lasting
inhibitor
of
HMG-CoA
reductase
that
is
highly
selective
for
hepatocytes
.

Its
pharmacokinetics
permit
once-daily
dosing
,
and
a
lack
of
oxidative
hepatic
metabolism
results
in
a
reduced
potential
for
drug-drug
interactions
.

Preliminary
clinical
results
indicate
that
it
produces
rapid
dose-related
reductions
in
total
cholesterol
,
low-density
lipoprotein
cholesterol
,
triglycerides
,
and
apolipoprotein
B
that
may
exceed
those
achieved
with
other
currently
available
statins
.

Increases
in
high-density
lipoprotein
cholesterol
have
also
been
observed
.

Rosuvastatin
is
also
well
tolerated
,
with
no
evidence
of
either
hepato-
or
myotoxicity
.

It
is
hoped
that
new
agents
such
as
rosuvastatin
may
help
to
reduce
the
high
global
morbidity
,
mortality
and
associated
costs
of
CHD
and
related
vascular
disorders

BACKGROUND
:
In
previous
studies
of
cynomolgus
monkey
lung
allograft
recipients
,
we
demonstrated
significant
immunosuppressive
efficacy
but
reduced
tolerability
after
combined
treatment
with
high
doses
of
microemulsion
cyclosporine
(
CsA
)
and
SDZ
RAD
(
40-O-
(
2-hydroxyethyl
)
-rapamycin
)
.

The
current
study
was
designed
to
compare
efficacy
and
tolerability
of
a
combination
of
low-dose
CsA
and
high-dose
SDZ
RAD
(
CTL
group
)
to
triple
therapy
using
the
chimeric
anti-interleukin-2
(
IL-2
)
receptor
(
CD25
)
monoclonal
antibody
(
mAb
)
basiliximab
(
anti-IL-2

)
for
induction
therapy
(

and

)
plus
low-dose
CsA
and
low-dose
SDZ
RAD
for
maintenance
immunosuppression
(
CD25
group
)
.

CsA
and
anti-IL-2
receptor
mAb
are
drugs
that
reduce
cytokine
synthesis
and
block
IL-2-mediated
lymphocyte
stimulation
,
respectively
.

SDZ

,

)
that
are
not
inhibited
by
anti-IL-2
receptor
mAb
.

METHODS
:
Twelve
unilateral
lung
transplants
were
performed
.

Recipients
were
observed
for
49
days
by
daily
weight
assessment
,
hemograms
,
blood
chemistries
,
radiographs
,
and
lung
biopsies
.

Monkeys
were
euthanized
before
day
49
in
the
event
of
excessive
weight
loss
(
>25%
)
or
organ
failure
.

Target
CsA
trough
levels
were
100-200
ng
/
ml
.

Target
SDZ
RAD
trough
levels
in
the
CTL
group
(
no
mAb
)
were
20-40
ng
/
ml
,
and
10-20
ng
/
ml
in
the
CD25
group
.

RESULTS
:
None
of
the
monkeys
in
the
CD25
group
needed
to
be
euthanized
early
due
to
signs
of
drug
toxicity
.

In
contrast
,
four
monkeys
in
the
CTL
group
were
sacrificed
on
days
28-35
as
a
result
of
excessive
weight
loss
(
n
=
3
)
and
renal
functional
impairment
(
n
=
1
)
.

Three
recipients
in
the
CD25
group
were
euthanized
on
days
36
,
38
,
and
46
as
a
result
of
persistent
high
fever
associated
with
severe
rejection
.

The
median
animal
survival
in
the
CTL
group
was
32
vs
.

46
days
in
the
CD25
group
(
P<0
.
04
)
.

The
only
two
long-term
survivors
in
the
CTL
group
showed
moderate
rejection
at
day
49
.

The
median
rejection
scores
at
day
14
(
A0
)
and
day
28
(
A2
)
were
identical
in
the
two
groups
,
despite
the
fact
that
the
mean
SDZ
RAD
trough
level
was
significantly
lower
in
the
CD25
group
(
CTL
:
38
+
/
-3
ng
/
ml
,
CD25
:
18
+
/
-2
ng
/
ml
,
P<0
.
0001
)
.

After
basiliximab
levels
fell
below
the
minimum
therapeutic
level
(
1
mg
/
ml
)
on
day
28
,
the
median
rejection
score
at
day
49
increased
to
A4
in
the
CD25
group
.

CONCLUSION
:
This
is
the
first
study
to
combine
an
anti-IL-2
receptor
mAb
with
a
drug
from
the
rapamycin
class
plus
CsA
.

Our
study
shows
that
induction
therapy
with
basiliximab
enabled
SDZ
RAD
blood
levels
to
be
significantly
reduced
,
which
led
to
improved
tolerability
without
the
penalty
of
increased
rejection

Cell
cholesterol
metabolism
is
a
tightly
regulated
process
,
dependent
in
part
on
activation
of
nuclear
liver
X
receptors
(
LXRs
)
to
increase
expression
of
genes
mediating
removal
of
excess
cholesterol
from
cells
in
the
reverse
cholesterol
transport
pathway
.

LXRs
are
thought
to
be
activated
predominantly
by
oxysterols
generated
enzymatically
from
cholesterol
in
different
cell
organelles
.

Defects
resulting
in
slowed
release
of
cholesterol
from
late
endosomes
and
lysosomes
or
reduction
in
sterol-27-hydroxylase
activity
lead
to
specific
blocks
in
oxysterol
production
and
impaired
LXR-dependent
gene
activation
.

This
block
does
not
appear
to
be
compensated
by
oxysterol
production
in
other
cell
compartments
.

The
purpose
of
this
review
is
to
summarize
current
knowledge
about
oxysterol-dependent
activation
by
LXR
of
genes
involved
in
reverse
cholesterol
transport
,
and
what
these
defects
of
cell
cholesterol
homeostasis
can
teach
us
about
the
critical
pathways
of
oxysterol
generation
for
expression
of
LXR-dependent
genes
.
Oxalate
synthesis
in
human
hepatocytes
is
not
well
defined
despite
the
clinical
significance
of
its
overproduction
in
diseases
such
as
the
primary
hyperoxalurias
.

To
further
define
these
steps
,
the
metabolism
to
oxalate
of
the
oxalate
precursors
glycolate
and
glyoxylate
and
the
possible
pathways
involved
were
examined
in
HepG2
cells
.

These
cells
were
found
to
contain
oxalate
,
glyoxylate
,
and
glycolate
as
intracellular
metabolites
and
to
excrete
oxalate
and
glycolate
into
the
medium
.

Glycolate
was
taken
up
more
effectively
by
cells
than
glyoxylate
,
but
glyoxylate
was
more
efficiently
converted
to
oxalate
.

Oxalate
was
formed
from
exogenous
glycolate
only
when
cells
were
exposed
to
high
concentrations
.

Peroxisomes
in
HepG2
cells
,
in
contrast
to
those
in
human
hepatocytes
,
were
not
involved
in
glycolate
metabolism
.

Incubations
with
purified
lactate
dehydrogenase
suggested
that
this
enzyme
was
responsible
for
the
metabolism
of
glycolate
to
oxalate
in
HepG2
cells
.

The
formation
of
14C-labeled
glycine
from
14C-labeled
glycolate
was
observed
only
when
cell
membranes
were
permeabilized
with
Triton
X-100
.

These
results
imply
that
peroxisome
permeability
to
glycolate
is
restricted
in
these
cells
.

Mitochondria
,
which
produce
glyoxylate
from
hydroxyproline
metabolism
,
contained
both
alanine
:
glyoxylate
aminotransferase
(
AGT
)
2
and
glyoxylate
reductase
activities
,
which
can
convert
glyoxylate
to
glycine
and
glycolate
,
respectively
.

Expression
of
AGT2
mRNA
in
HepG2
cells
was
confirmed
by
RT-PCR
.

These
results
indicate
that
HepG2
cells
will
be
useful
in
clarifying
the
nonperoxisomal
metabolism
associated
with
oxalate
synthesis
in
human
hepatocytes
.

the

The
half-life
of
nicotine
elimination
was
33

,
and

were
undetectable
by
4h
.

Average
plasma

over

was

similar
to

seen
in

Nicotine

To
understand
the
potential
for
drug
interactions
and
regulation
of
nicotine
metabolism
in
zebra
finches
,
we
characterized
in

nicotine
metabolism
and
the
hepatic
enzyme
involved
.

In
humans
,
cytochrome
P450
(
CYP
)

metabolizes
nicotine
to
cotinine
,
and
CYP2A-like
activity
and

have
been
reported
in
some

to

with

Nicotine
and

were
inhibited
by

(

)
but
not
CYP2A-specific

correlated
with

,
suggesting

We
have
demonstrated
that
aryl
hydrocarbon
receptor
(
AhR
)
is
overexpressed
in
lung
adenocarcinoma
(
AD
)
.

AhR
is
usually
associated
with
heat
shock
protein
90
(
Hsp90
)
in
the
cytoplasm
.

17-Allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin
(
17-AAG
)
,
an
Hsp90
inhibitor
,
is
currently
under
evaluation
for
its
anticancer
activity
in
clinical
trials
.

Here
we
investigated
whether
AhR
plays
a
role
in
17-AAG-mediated
anticancer
activity
by
functioning
as
a
downstream
target
or
by
modulating
its
anticancer
efficacy
.

AhR
expression
in
lung
AD
cells
was
modulated
by
siRNA
interference
or
overexpression
.

Tumor
growth
was
determined
with
colony
formation
in
vitro
or
in
vivo
.

Anticancer
activity
of
17-AAG
was
determined
by
measuring
cell
viability
,
cell
cycle
distribution
,
and
expression
of
cell
cycle
regulators
.

Proteins
and
mRNA
levels
were
examined
by
immunoblotting
and
the
real-time
reverse
transcription-polymerase
chain
reaction
,
respectively
.

In
this
study
,
AhR
overexpression
positively
modulated
growth
of
lung
AD
cells
,
at
least
partially
,
via
RelA-dependent
mechanisms
.

Although
treatment
with
17-AAG
reduced
AhR
levels
and
AhR-regulated
gene
expression
in
lung
AD
cells
,
AhR
expression
increased
anticancer
activity
of
17-AAG
.

In
addition
,
17-AAG
treatment
reduced
cell
viability
,
CDK2
,
CDK4
,
cyclin
E
,
cyclin
D1
,
and
phosphorylated
Rb
levels
in
AhR-expressing
lung
AD
cells
.

NAD
(
P
)
H
:
quinone
oxidoreductase
(
NQO1
)
,
which
is
regulated
by
AhR
,
was
shown
to
increase
anticancer
activity
of
17-AAG
in
cells
.

Knockdown
of
NQO1
expression
attenuated
the
reduction
of
cell
cycle
regulators
by
17-AAG
treatment
in
AhR
overexpressed
cells
.

We
demonstrated
that
AhR
protein
not
only
functions
as
a
downstream
target
of
17-AAG
,
but
also
enhances
anticancer
activity
of
17-AAG
in
lung
AD
cells
.
Rifampicin
,
an
important
drug
in
the
treatment
of
tuberculosis
,
is
used
extensively
despite
its
broad
effects
on
drug-drug
interactions
,
creating
serious
problems
.

The
clinical
importance
of
such
interactions
includes
autoinduction
leading
to
suboptimal
or
failed
treatment
.

The
concomitantly
administered
effects
of
rifampicin
on
other
drugs
can
result
in
their
altered
metabolism
or
transportation
that
are
metabolised
by
cytochromes
P450
or
transported
by
p-glycoprotein
in
the
gastrointestinal
tract
and
liver
.

This
review
paper
summarises
recent
findings
with
emphases
on
the
molecular
mechanisms
used
to
explain
these
broad
drug-drug
interactions
.

In
general
,
rifampicin
can
act
on
a
pattern
:
rifampicin
activates
the
nuclear
pregnane
X
receptor
that
in
turn
affects
cytochromes
P450
,
glucuronosyltransferases
and
p-glycoprotein
activities
.

This
pattern
of
action
may
explain
many
of
the
rifampicin
inducing
drug-drug
interactions
.

However
,
effects
through
other
mechanisms
have
also
been
reported
and
these
make
any
explanation
of
such
drug-drug
interactions
more
complex
.

Despite
abundant
research
that
has
been
carried
out
on
the
potential
health
benefits
of
pu-erh
tea
,
no
consensus
till
now
,
has
been
reached
on
which
constituent
is
mainly
responsible
for
its
bioactivity
.

In
this
work
,
the
aqueous
extract
(
AE
)
and
its
fraction
enriched
with
active
constituents
were
prepared
from
pu-erh
tea
,
and
their
bioactivities
were
investigated
.

It
was
found
that
tea
polyphenols
(
TP
)
,
tea
polysaccharides
(
TPS
)
,
caffeine
(
Caf
)
,
protein
(
Pro
)
,
amino
acids
(
AA
)
were
accumulated
in
several
fractions
after
solvent
extraction
despite
not
being
separated
completely
.

Meanwhile
,
95%
ethanol
precipitate
(
EP
)
and
ethyl
acetate
fraction
(
EF
)
possessed
remarkable
antioxidant
activity
and
potent
inhibitory
effects
against
α-glycosidase
in
vitro
.

Furthermore
,
all
the
extracts
(
50
mg
/
kg
BW
)
showed
a
significant
(
p<0
.
05
)
effect
on
postprandial
hyperglycemia
in
diabetic
mice
as
compared
with
a
model
group
,
and
the
suppression
of
EP
was
not
significantly
(
p>0
.
05
)
different
from
that
of
acarbose
at
the
same
dosage
(
50
mg
/
kg
BW
)
,
which
indicate
that
these
fractions
could
be
developed
as
potential
anti-diabetic
agents
.
Beta-amyloid
(
Aβ
)
is
a
major
pathogenic
peptide
in
Alzheimer's
disease
(
AD
)
and
is
generated
by
the
processing
of
amyloid
precursor
protein
(
APP
)
.

We
have
previously
reported
that
the
brown
algae
Ecklonia
cava
,
which
has
anti-oxidant
and
anti-inflammatory
functions
,
decreased
Aβ
production
and
further
aggregation
in
HEK293
cells
expressing
the
APP
Swedish
mutation
.

Here
,
we
show
the
reduction
mechanism
of
Aβ
production
using
the
butanol
extract
of
Ecklonia
cava
through
the
examination
of
expression
and
activity
of
alpha-
,
beta-
,
and
gamma-secretase
.

Treatment
with
the
extract
resulted
in
the
activation
of
alpha-secretase
with
a
contrasting
decrease
in
its
mRNA
and
protein
expression
.

This
activation
was
consistent
with
the
translocation
of
the
extract
into
the
plasma
membrane
of
the
secretase
.

Gamma-secretase
activity
was
lowered
by
E
.

cava
,
and
this
effect
may
be
due
to
the
decreased
expression
of
PSEN1
mRNA
and
protein
.

In
addition
,
the
basal
nuclear
location
of
PSEN1
,
which
may
affect
chromosome
missegregation
in
neurodegenerative
disease
,
was
reduced
by
the
extract
,
despite
the
significance
of
this
finding
remains
unclear
.

Taken
together
,
these
results
led
us
to
conclude
that
E
.

cava
regulated
the
expression
and
activity
of
gamma-secretase
and
alpha-secretase
,
leading
to
a
reduction
in
Aβ
production
by
the
stable
cells
.

Our
data
indicate
that
E
.

cava
is
a
novel
natural-product
candidate
for
AD
treatment
,
although
further
in
vivo
studies
are
needed
.

The
field
of
proteomics
is
undergoing
rapid
development
in
a
number
of
different
areas
including
improvements
in
mass
spectrometric
platforms
,
peptide
identification
algorithms
and
bioinformatics
.

In
particular
,
new
and
/
or
improved
approaches
have
established
robust
methods
that
not
only
allow
for
in-depth
and
accurate
peptide
and
protein
identification
and
modification
,
but
also
allow
for
sensitive
measurement
of
relative
or
absolute
quantitation
.

These
methods
are
beginning
to
be
applied
to
the
area
of
neuroproteomics
,
but
the
central
nervous
system
poses
many
specific
challenges
in
terms
of
quantitative
proteomics
,
given
the
large
number
of
different
neuronal
cell
types
that
are
intermixed
and
that
exhibit
distinct
patterns
of
gene
and
protein
expression
.

This
review
highlights
the
recent
advances
that
have
been
made
in
quantitative
neuroproteomics
,
with
a
focus
on
work
published
over
the
last
five
years
that
applies
emerging
methods
to
normal
brain
function
as
well
as
to
various
neuropsychiatric
disorders
including
schizophrenia
and
drug
addiction
as
well
as
of
neurodegenerative
diseases
including
Parkinson's
disease
and
Alzheimer's
disease
.

While
older
methods
such
as
two-dimensional
polyacrylamide
electrophoresis
continued
to
be
used
,
a
variety
of
more
in-depth
MS-based
approaches
including
both
label
(
ICAT
,
iTRAQ
,
TMT
,
SILAC
,
SILAM
)
,
label-free
(
label-free

,
SWATH
)
and
absolute
quantification
methods
,
are
rapidly
being
applied
to
neurobiological
investigations
of
normal
and
diseased
brain
tissue
as
well
as
of
cerebrospinal
fluid
(
CSF
)
.

While
the
biological
implications
of
many
of
these
studies
remain
to
be
clearly
established
,
that
there
is
a
clear
need
for
standardization
of
experimental
design
and
data
analysis
,
and
that
the
analysis
of
protein
changes
in
specific
neuronal
cell
types
in
the
central
nervous
system
remains
a
serious
challenge
,
it
appears
that
the
quality
and
depth
of
the
more
recent
quantitative
proteomics
studies
is
beginning
to
shed
light
on
a
number
of
aspects
of
neuroscience
that
relates
to
normal
brain
function
as
well
as
of
the
changes
in
protein
expression
and
regulation
that
occurs
in
neuropsychiatric
and
neurodegenerative
disorders
.
Currently
,
there
is
no
ideal
noninvasive
method
to
quantify
the
progressive
loss
of
pancreatic
β-cell
mass
(
BCM
)
that
occurs
in
type
1
diabetes
.

Magnetic
resonance
imaging
has
detected
gross
differences
in
BCM
between
healthy
and
diabetic
mice
using
the
contrast
agent
manganese
,
which
labels
functional
β-cells
and
increases
the
water
proton
relaxation
rate
(
R1
)
,
but
its
ability
to
measure
gradations
in
BCM
during
disease
progression
is
unknown
.

Our
objective
was
to
test
the
hypothesis
that
measurements
of
the
manganese-enhanced
pancreatic
R1
could
detect
decreasing
BCM
in
a
mouse
model
of
type
1
diabetes
.

We
used
cyclophosphamide-accelerated
BDC2

5
T-cell
receptor
transgenic
nonobese
diabetic
mice
,
which
experience
development
of
type
1
diabetes
during
a
7-day
time
period
after
cyclophosphamide
injection
,
whereas
transgene-negative
mice
do
not
.

We
measured
the
manganese-enhanced
pancreatic
R1
before
cyclophosphamide
injection
(
day
0
)
and
on
days
3
,
4
,
5
,
and
7
afterward
.

Pancreatic
R1
remained
constant
in
transgene-negative
mice
and
decreased
stepwise
day-to-day
in
transgene-positive
mice
,
mirroring
their
loss
of
BCM
,
confirmed
by
pancreatic
insulin
measurements
and
histology
.

Changes
in
R1
in
transgene-positive
mice
occurred
before
elevations
in
blood
glucose
,
a
clinical
indicator
of
diabetes
,
suggesting
potential
for
early
noninvasive
detection
of
changes
in
functional
BCM

Currently
the

is
in

It

to
be
safe

effective
at
promoting
aquaresis
and
raising
serum

in
both
short-

.

Tolvaptan
is
also
effective
for

exacerbation
,
but
whether
there
are
long
standing
beneficial
effects
on

is
still
controversial
.

Prolonged
use
of
tolvaptan
leads
to
increased
endogenous
levels
of
AVP
and
perhaps
over-stimulation
of
V
(
1A
)
receptors
.

Theoretically
this
activation
could
lead
to
increased
afterload
and
cardiac
myocyte
fibrosis
,
causing
progression
of
CHF
.

However
,
after
52
weeks
of
tolvaptan
therapy
there
was
no
worsening
of
left
ventricular
dilatation
.

In
addition
,
tolvaptan
is
metabolized
by
the
CYP3A4
system;
thus
physicians
should
be
aware
of
the
potential
for
increased
interactions
with
other
medications
.

Tolvaptan
is
a
breakthrough
in
the
therapy
of
hyponatremia
as
it
directly
combats
elevated
AVP
levels
associated
with
the
syndrome
of
inappropriate
secretion
of
antidiuretic
hormone
,
congestive
heart
failure
,
and

A

Microvascular
dysfunction
critically
contributes
to
the
morbidity
and
mortality
of
this
disease
.

The
angiopoietin
(
Angpt
)
/
Tie2
system
consists
of
the
transmembrane
endothelial
tyrosine
kinase
Tie2
and
its
circulating
ligands
(
Angpt-1
,
-2
,
and
-3
/
4
)
.

The
balance
between
the
canonical
agonist
Angpt-1
and
its
competitive
inhibitor
,
Angpt-2
,
regulates
basal
endothelial
barrier
function
and
the
leakage
and
vascular
inflammation
that
develop
in
response
to
pathogens
and
cytokines
.

Here
we
summarize
recent
work
in
mice
and
men
to
highlight
the
therapeutic
potential
in
this
pathway
to
prevent
or
even
reverse
microvascular
dysfunction
in
this
deadly
disease
.

dwarf

are
deficient
in
growth
hormone
,
prolactin
,
and
thyroid-stimulating
hormone
and
live
significantly
longer
than
their
normal
siblings
.

In
the
current
study
,
we
found
that
the
hormone
deficiencies
affect
methionine
metabolism
.

We
previously
reported
that
the
dwarf
mice
exhibit
enzyme
activities
and
levels
that
combat
oxidative
stress
more
efficiently
than
those
of
normal
mice
.

Moreover
,
methionine
or
metabolites
of
methionine
are
involved
in
antioxidative
processes
.

Thus
,
we
performed
an
experiment
that
compared
various
parameters
of
methionine
metabolism
between
18-month
old
male
dwarf
(
N
=
6
)
and
wild
type
(
N
=
5
)
mice
.

The
specific
activity
of
liver
methionine
adenosyltransferase
(
MAT
)
was
significantly
elevated
(
205%
,
p<0
.
0001
)
in
the
dwarf
mice
,
as
were
cystathionine
synthase
(
50%
,
p<0
.
01
)
,
cystathionase
(
83%
,
p<0
.
001
)
,
and
glycine
N-methyltransferase
(
GNMT
,
91%
,
p<0
.
001
)
activities
.

Even
though
the
activities
of
MAT
and
GNMT
were
elevated
,
the
concentration
of
liver
S-adenosylmethionine
was
decreased
(
24%
,
p<0
.
001
)
and
S-adenosylhomocysteine
increased
(
113%
,
p<0
.
001
)
in
the
dwarf
mice
.

These
data
indicate
that
dwarf
mice
,
compared
to
wild
type
mice
,
have
a
markedly
different
metabolism
of
methionine
.

Altered
methionine
metabolism
may
partially
explain
earlier
reports
indicating
less
oxidative
damage
to
proteins
in
dwarf
mice
.

Taken
together
,
the
data
suggest
that
methionine
metabolism
may
play
a
role
in
oxidative
defense
in
the
dwarf
mouse
and
should
be
studied
as
a
potential
mechanism
of
extended
lifespan
.

High

)
rats
have
been
developed
by
divergent
artificial
selection
for
treadmill
endurance
running
capacity
to
explore
an
aerobic
biology-disease
connection
.

The
beneficial
effects
of
resveratrol
supplementation
have
been
demonstrated
in
endurance
running
and
the
antioxidant
capacity
of
resveratrol
is
also
demonstrated
.

In
this
study
we
examine
whether
12weeks
of
treadmill
exercise
training
and
/
or
resveratrol
can
enhance
performance
in
HCR
.

Indeed
,
resveratrol
increased
aerobic
performance
and
strength
of
upper
limbs
of
these
rats
.

Moreover
,
we
have
found
that
resveratrol
activated
the
AMP-activated
protein
kinase
,
SIRT1
,
and
mitochondrial
transcription
factor
A
(
p<0
.
05
)
.

The
changes
in
mitochondrial
fission
/
fusion
and
Lon
protease
/
HSP78
levels
suggest
that
exercise
training
does
not
significantly
induce
damage
of
proteins
.

Moreover
,
neither
exercise
training
nor
resveratrol
supplementation
altered
the
content
of
protein
carbonyls
.

Changes
in
the
levels
of
forkhead
transcription
factor
1
and
SIRT4
could
suggest
increased
fat
utilization
and
improved
insulin
sensitivity
.

These
data
indicate
,
that
resveratrol
supplementation
enhances
aerobic
performance
due
to
the
activation
of
the
AMPK-SIRT1-PGC-1α
pathway
.

Current

for

focus
on

.

After
physicochemical
studies
focusing
on

solubilization
,
3-drug
PEG-b-PCL
micelles
were
evaluated
in

in
2-D

in

models
of
ovarian
cancer
,
tracking
bioluminescence
signals
from

.

3-Drug
PEG-b-PCL
micelles
were
not
significantly
more
potent
in
2-D
cell
culture
in
comparison
to
paclitaxel;
however
,
they
disaggregated
ES-2
tumor

,
whereas
single
drugs
or
2-drug
combinations
only
slowed
growth
of
ES-2
tumor
spheroids
or
had
no
noticeable
effects
.

In
ES-2
and
SKOV3
xenograft
models
,
3-drug
PEG-b-PCL
micelles
had
significantly
less
tumor
burden
than
paclitaxel

(

)
F-FLT-PET
images
clearly
showed
that
3-drug
PEG-b-PCL
micelles
dramatically
reduce
tumor
volumes
over
paclitaxel
and
vehicle
controls
.

In
summary
,
PEG-b-PCL
micelles
enable
the
IP
combination
drug
delivery
of
paclitaxel
,
cyclopamine
and
gossypol
,
resulting
in
tumor
growth
inhibition
and
prolonged
survival
over

profile
from
the
use
of

Physicians
should

.

The
optimal
timing
for

is
from
6
to
24
hours
from
onset
of

When

Intermittent
PTH
is
the
major
anabolic
therapy
for
osteoporosis
while
continuous
PTH
causes
bone
loss
.

PTH
acts
on
the
osteoblast
(
OB
)
lineage
to
regulate
bone
resorption
and
formation
.

PTH
also
induces
cyclooxygenase-2
(
COX-2
)
,
producing
prostaglandin
E2
(
PGE2
)
,
that
can
act
on
both
OBs
and
osteoclasts
(
OCs
)
.

Because
intermittent
PTH
is
more
anabolic
in
Cox-2
knockout
(
KO
)
than
wild
type
(
WT
)
mice
,
we
hypothesized
COX-2
might
contribute
to
the
effects
of
continuous
PTH
by
suppressing
PTH-stimulated
differentiation
of
mesenchymal
stem
cells
into
OBs
.

We
compared
effects
of
continuous
PTH
on
bone
marrow
stromal
cells
(
BMSCs
)
and
primary
OBs
(
POBs
)
from
Cox-2
KO
mice
,
mice
with
deletion
of
PGE2
receptors
(
Ptger4
and
Ptger2
KO
mice
)
,
and
WT
controls
.

PTH
increased
OB
differentiation
in
BMSCs
only
in
the
absence
of
COX-2
expression
or
activity
.

In
the
absence
of
COX-2
,
PTH
stimulated
differentiation
if
added
during
the
first
week
of
culture
.

In
Cox-2
KO
BMSCs
,
PTH-stimulated
differentiation
was
prevented
by
adding
PGE2
to
cultures
.

Co-culture
of
POBs
with
M-CSF-expanded
bone
marrow
macrophages
(
BMMs
)
showed
that
the
inhibition
of
PTH-stimulated
OB
differentiation
required
not
only
COX-2
or
PGE2
but
also
BMMs
.

Sufficient
PGE2
to
mediate
the
inhibitory
effect
was
made
by
either
WT
POBs
or
WT
BMMs
.

The
inhibitory
effect
mediated
by
COX-2
/
PGE2
was
transferred
by
conditioned
media
from
RANKL-treated
BMMs
and
could
be
blocked
by
osteoprotegerin
,
which
interferes
with
RANKL
binding
to
its
receptor
on
OC
lineage
cells
.

Deletion
of
Ptger4
,
but
not
Ptger2
,
in
BMMs
prevented
the
inhibition
of
PTH-stimulated
OB
differentiation
.

As
expected
,
PGE2
also
stimulated
OB
differentiation
,
but
when
given
in
combination
with
PTH
,
the
stimulatory
effects
of
both
were
abrogated
.

These
data
suggest
that
PGE2
,
acting
via
EP4R
on
BMMs
committed
to
the
OC
lineage
,
stimulated
secretion
of
a
factor
or
factors
that
acted
to
suppress
PTH-stimulated
OB
differentiation
.

This
suppression
of
OB
differentiation
could
contribute
to
the
bone
loss
seen
with
continuous
PTH
in
vivo
.

in

study
in

In
addition
,
the
beneficial
effects
of
treatment
with
abciximab
previously
observed
in
the
randomised
,
multicentre
,
placebo-controlled
EPILOG
and
EPISTENT
studies
have
been
maintained
to
1
year
,
with
a
significantly
reduced
incidence
of
ischaemic
complications
relative
to
placebo
consistently
observed
across
a
range
of
subgroups
including
age
,
sex
,
bodyweight
and
indication
for
revascularisation
.

The
incidence
of
the
composite
endpoint
was
reduced
in
patients
presenting
with
acute
MI
of
<48
hours'
duration
in
comparison
with
either
fibrinolytic
therapy
or
stenting
alone
in
the
randomised
STOPAMI
and
ADMIRAL
trials
,
primarily
because
of
a
reduced
requirement
for
urgent
repeat
revascularisation
and
reduced
incidence
of
mortality
.

In
the
randomised
,
nonblind
,
multicentre
CADILLAC
trial
in
patients
with
acute
myocardial
infarction
(
MI
)
,
stenting
alone
was
superior
to
percutaneous
transluminal
coronary
angioplasty
(
PTCA
)
and
stenting
alone
was
not
inferior
to
PTCA
plus
abciximab
.

Recent
large
randomised
,
multicentre
studies
(
ASSENT-3
and
GUSTO-V
)
have
shown
higher
efficacy
(
on
various
ischaemic
endpoints
)
of
abciximab
in
combination
with
either
a
reduced
dose
of
tenecteplase
or
reteplase
compared
with
the
fibrinolytic
drug
alone
.

TIMI
grade
3
flow
rates
at
60
and
90
minutes
in
the
TIMI-14
and
SPEED
trials
were
higher
in
patients
who
received
abciximab
in
combination
with
either
alteplase
or
reteplase
than
abciximab
alone
and
were
similar
to
that
seen
with
the
full-dose
fibrinolytic
alone
.

In
the
randomised
,
multicentre
GUSTO
IV-ACS
study
,
no
significant
differences
in
any
of
the
ischaemic
endpoints
at
either
7
or
30
days
in
patients
with
acute
coronary
syndromes
who
were
not
scheduled
to
undergo
early
revascularisation
(
within
12
hours
of
end
of
infusion
)
were
apparent
between
those
who
received
abciximab
(
bolus
and
either
24-
or
48-hour
infusion
)
and
those
who
received
placebo
in
addition
to
aspirin
and
heparin
.

The
most
common
adverse
events
associated
with
the
use
of
abciximab
are
bleeding
complications
and
thrombocytopenia
,
although
the
risk
of
major
bleeding
can
be
limited
through
adhering
to
current
administration
protocols
.

Treatment
costs
are
generally
higher
in
both
stent
plus
abciximab
and
angioplasty
plus
abciximab
groups
than
stent
plus
placebo
,
primarily
because
of
the
acquisition
cost
of
abciximab
.

Abciximab
appeared
most
cost
beneficial
in
high-risk
patients
undergoing
elective
percutaneous
coronary
revascularisation;
among
lower
risk
patients
,
abciximab
therapy
has
been
associated
with
higher
total
in-hospital
and
6-month
medical
costs
than
eptifibatide
.

CONCLUSION
:
The
GP
IIb
/
IIIa
receptor
antagonist
abciximab
,
when
used
with
aspirin
and
heparin
,
has
demonstrated
efficacy
in
reducing
the
short-
and
long-term
risk
of
ischaemic
complications
in
patients
with
ischaemic
heart
disease
undergoing
percutaneous
coronary
intervention
,
when
used
with
aspirin
and
heparin
.

High-risk
patients
(
including
those
with
diabetes
mellitus
)
derive
particular
benefits
from
abciximab
treatment
.

Abciximab
remains
an
important
therapeutic
option
for
the
prevention
of
complications
in
patients
with

Podocytes
expressed
most
isoforms
of
retinoic
acid
receptors
(
RAR
)
and
retinoid
X
receptors
(
RXR
)
with
the
exception
of
RXRgamma
.

RARalpha
antagonists
blocked
atRA-induced
cAMP
production
and
its
antiproliferative
and
prodifferentiation
effects
on
podocytes
,
suggesting
that
RARalpha
is
required
.

For
determination
of
the
effect
of
increased
intracellular
cAMP
on
HIV-infected
podocytes
,
cells
were
stimulated
with
either
forskolin
or
8-bromo-cAMP
.

Both
compounds
inhibited
cell
proliferation
significantly
and
restored
synaptopodin
expression
in
HIV-infected
podocytes
.

The
effects
of
atRA
were
abolished
by
Rp-cAMP
,
an
inhibitor
of
the
cAMP
/
protein
kinase
A
pathway
and
were
enhanced
by
rolipram
,
an
inhibitor
of
phosphodiesterase
4
,
suggesting
that
the
antiproliferative
and
prodifferentiation
effects
of
atRA
on
HIV-infected
podocytes
are
cAMP
dependent
.

Furthermore
,
both
atRA
and
forskolin
suppressed
HIV-induced
mitogen-activated
protein
kinase
1
and
2
and
Stat3
phosphorylation
.

In
vivo
,
atRA
reduced
proteinuria
,
cell
proliferation
,
and
glomerulosclerosis
in
HIV-1-transgenic
mice
.

These
findings
suggest
that
atRA
reverses
the
abnormal
phenotype
in
HIV-1-infected
podocytes
by
stimulating
RARalpha-mediated
intracellular
cAMP
production
.

These
results
demonstrate
the
mechanism
by
which
atRA
reverses
the
proliferation
of
podocytes
that
is
induced
by
HIV-1

The

was
to

In
this

from
transgenic
rats
harboring
the
temperature-sensitive

were
used
as
an

TR-MUL
cells
express
large
T-antigen
and
grow
well
at
33
degrees
C
with
a
doubling
time
of
30
h
,
but
do
not
grow
at

degrees

.

TR-MUL
cells
express
typical
Muller
cell
markers
such
as
S-100
,
glutamine

,
and
EAAT1

GLAST
,
whereas
EAAT2

EAAT5
are
not
detected
.

TR-MUL
cells
also
exhibit
little
or
no
expression
of
glial

.

We
found
that
TR-MUL5
cells
exhibited
[
(

C
]
L-cystine
uptake
activity
and
expressed
xCT
and

The
uptake

L-cystine
was
significantly
inhibited
by
L-glutamic

had
no
effect
.

Following
diethyl

(
DEM

treatment
,
the
glutathione
concentration
in
TR-MUL5
cells
was
reduced
in
the
first
24
h
,
then
gradually
recovered
for
more
than
24
h
.

The
L-cystine
uptake
rate
and
the
xCT
expression
level
in
TR-MUL5
cells
were
enhanced
by
DEM
treatment
.

In
contrast
,
the
4F2hc
expression
level
was
unchanged

In
conclusion
,
TR-MUL

Current
theories
on
the
mechanism
of
migraine
suggest
the
central
role
of
vasodilation
of
intracranial
,
extracerebral
blood
vessels
and
activation
of
perivascular
trigeminal
sensory
nerves
.

There
abundantly
exist
5-HT

1B
)
receptors
in
meningeal
blood
vessels
and
5-HT
(
1D
)
receptors
in
the
trigeminal
ganglia
.

The
therapeutic
activity
of
rizatriptan
in
migraine
can
most
likely
be
attributed
to
agonist
effects
at
5-HT
(
1B

receptors
on
these
target
sites
.

Two

,
are
available
.

The
latter
may
have
a
clinical
relevance
for
patients
who
administer
it

resulting
in

and
also

Bioavailability
was
estimated
to
be
about

.

The
efficacy
and
good
tolerability
and
underlying
profiles
of
pharmacokinetics
of
rizatriptan
are
almost
similar
between
Japanese
and
other
races
,
and
a
reduction
in
headache
response
up
to
2
h
can
be
attained
in
a
large
majority
of
patients
.

Several
reports
have
described
the
favorable
clinical
profile
of
rizatriptan
in
comparison
to
other
triptans
.

Rizatriptan
is
thus
effective
and
provides
migraine

INTRODUCTION
:
The
association
between
use
of
nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory
drugs
(
NSAIDs
)
and
breast
cancer
risk
remains
unclear
.

Inconsistencies
in
previously
reported
findings
may
be
partly
due
to
differences
in
expression
of
cyclooxygenase
(
COX
)
-2
.

We
hypothesized
that
genetic
polymorphisms
(
COX-2
.
926
,
COX-2
.
5209
,
and
COX-2
.
8473
)
may
reduce
overall
breast
cancer
risk
or
risk
for
subtypes
of
breast
cancer
by
modulating
the
inflammatory
response
and
may
interact
with
aspirin
or
any
NSAID
use
.

METHODS
:
We
conducted
a
population-based
,
case-control
study
in
which
we
genotyped
1
,
067
breast
cancer
cases
and
1
,
110
control
individuals
included
in
the
Long
Island
Breast
Cancer
Study
Project
.

RESULTS
:
No
major
effects
of
the
three
COX-2
variant
alleles
on
breast
cancer
risk
were
found
.

A
total
of
eight
distinct
haplotypes
and
18
diplotypes
were
observed
in
the
population
.

Overall
,
no
significant
associations
between
COX-2
haplotypes
/
diplotypes
and
breast
cancer
risk
were
observed
.

Among
women
who
used
aspirin
or
any
NSAID
there
was
little
evidence
for
an
interaction
with
the
at-risk
COX-2
genotypes
,
with
one
exception
.

Among
women
with
hormone
receptor
positive
breast
cancer
,
the
reduced
risk
for
any
NSAID
use
was
only
evident
among
those
who
had
at
least
one
variant
C
allele
of
COX-2
.
8473

.

There
was
no

for
aspirin
use
,
possibly
because
of
limited
power
.

CONCLUSION
:
These
data
provide
modest
evidence
that
the
C
allele
of
COX-2
.
8473
may
interact
with
NSAIDs
to
reduce
risk
for

Vitamin
E
plays
an
essential
role
in
maintaining
the
structure
and
function
of
the
nervous
system
,
and
its
deficiency
,
commonly
associated
with
fat
malabsorption
diseases
,
may
reduce
neuronal
survival
.

We
previously
demonstrated
that
the
somatostatinergic
system
,
implicated
in
neuronal
survival
control
,
can
be
modulated
by
α-tocopherol
in
the
rat
dentate
gyrus
,
increasing
cyclic
adenosine
monophosphate
response
element
binding
protein
phosphorylation
.

To
gain
a
better
understanding
of
the
molecular
actions
of
tocopherols
and
examine
the
link
among
vitamin
E
,
somatostatin
and
neuronal
survival
,
we
have
investigated
the
effects
of
a
deficiency
and
subsequent
administration
of
tocopherol
on
the
somatostatin
signaling
pathway
and
neuronal
survival
in
the
rat
hippocampus
.

No
changes
in
somatostatin
expression
were
detected
in
vitamin-E-deficient
rats
.

These
rats
,
however
,
showed
a
significant
increase
in
the
somatostatin
receptor
density
and
dissociation
constant
,
which
correlated
with
a
significant
increase
in
the
protein
levels
of
somatostatin
receptors
.

Nevertheless
,
vitamin
E
deficiency
impaired
the
ability
of
the
somatostatin
receptors
to
couple
to
the
effectors
adenylyl
cyclase
and
phosphotyrosine
phosphatase
by
diminishing
Gi
protein
functionality
.

Furthermore
,
vitamin
E
deficiency
significantly
increased
phosphotyrosine
phosphatase
activity
and
PTPη
expression
,
as
well
as
PKCδ
activation
,
and
decreased
extracellular-signal-regulated
kinase
phosphorylation
.

All
these
changes
were
accompanied
by
an
increase
in
neuronal
cell
death
.

Subsequent
α-tocopherol
administration
partially
or
completely
reversed
all
these
values
to
control
levels
.

Altogether
,
our
results
prove
the
importance
of
vitamin
E
homeostasis
in
the
somatostatin
receptor-effector
system
and
suggest
a
possible
mechanism
by
which
this
vitamin
may
regulate
the
neuronal
cell
survival
in
the
adult
hippocampus
.

Ceramide
is
an
important
regulatory
molecule
implicated
in
a
variety
of
biological
processes
in
response
to
stress
and
cytokines
.

To
understand
the
signal
transduction
pathway
of
ceramide
to
the
nucleus
,
in
the
present
study
,
we
examined
whether
C2-ceramide
,
a
cell
permeable
ceramide
,
activates
c-fos
serum
response
element
(
SRE
)
.

Treatment
of
Rat-2
fibroblast
cells
with
C2-ceramide
caused
the
stimulation
of
c-fos
SRE-dependent
reporter
gene
activity
in
a
dose-
and
time-dependent
manner
by
transient
transfection
analysis
.

Next
,
we
examined
the
role
of
Rho
family
GTPases
in
the
ceramide-induced
signalling
to
SRE
activation
.

By
reporter
gene
analysis
following
transient
transfections
with
various
plasmids
expressing
a
dominant
negative
mutant
form
of
Cdc42
,
Rac1
or
RhoA
,
C2-ceramide-induced
SRE
activation
was
shown
to
be
selectively
repressed
by
pEXV-RacN17
encoding
a
dominant
negative
mutant
of
Rac1
,
suggesting
that
Rac
activity
is
essential
for
the
signalling
cascade
of
ceramide
to
the
nucleus
.

In
a
further
study
to
analyse
the
downstream
mediator
of
Rac
in
the
ceramide-signalling
pathway
,
we
observed
that
either
pretreatment
with
mepacrine
,
a
potent
and
specific
inhibitor
of
phospholipase
A2
,
or
co-transfection
with
antisense
cytosolic
phospholipase
A2
(
cPLA2
)
oligonucleotide
repressed
the
C2-ceramide-induced
SRE
activation
selectively
,
implying
a
critical
role
of
cPLA2
in
C2-ceramide-induced
signalling
to
nucleus
.

Consistent
with
these
results
,
the
translocation
of
cPLA2
protein
as
well
as
the
release
of
arachidonic
acid
,
a
principal
product
of
phospholipase
A2
,
was
rapidly
induced
by
the
addition
of
C2-ceramide
in
a
Rac-dependent
manner
.

Together
,
our
findings
suggest
the
critical
role
of
'Rac
and
subsequent
activation
of
phospholipase
A2'
in
ceramide-signalling
to
nucleus
.

Mercury
and
lead
are
widespread
in
the
environment
,
causing
chronic
exposure
of
a
large
population
to
low
concentrations
of
these
metals
.

While
several
studies
demonstrated
that
low
levels
of
both
metals
affect
the
immune
system
,
little
is
known
about
underlying
molecular
mechanisms
.

The
objective
of
this
study
was
to
investigate
the
impact
of
mercuric
(
Hg
(
2
+
)
)
and
lead
(
Pb
(
2
+
)
)
ions
on
T
cells
.

Up
to
100
μM
Pb
(
NO
(
3
)
)
(
2
)
had
no
effect
on
cellular
viability
and
proliferation
.

In
contrast
,
HgCl
(
2
)
caused
a
concentration-dependent
decline
of
viable
leukocytes
and
especially
of
activated
T
cells
.

Additionally
,
Hg
(
2
+
)
induced
reactive
oxygen
species
(
ROS
)
generation
accompanied
by
the
loss
of
mitochondrial
transmembrane
potential
,
measured
by
Dihydrorhodamine
and
Rhodamine-123
,
respectively
.

The
antioxidant
N-acetylcysteine
partially
reversed
the
toxic
effects
of
Hg
(
2
+
)
,
pointing
to
an
involvement
of
ROS
.

The
major
cytokine
controlling
T-cell
survival
and
proliferation
is
interleukin
(
IL
)
-2
.

Hg
(
2
+
)
had
no
effect
on
the
secretion
of
IL-2
,
but
on
IL-2
mediated
signal
transduction
pathways
,
reducing
phosphorylation
of
the
downstream
kinases
ERK1
/
2
and
AKT
.

Moreover
,
Hg
(
2
+
)
led
to
an
arrest
of
the
cells
in
the
S
phase
of
the
cell
cycle
.

Taken
together
,
these
data
fit
a
model
in
which
Hg
(
2
+
)
disrupts
mitochondria
,
and
the
resulting
release
of
ROS
inhibits
IL-2-dependent
signal
transduction
,
reducing
proliferation
and
survival
of
T
cells
.
The
active
transport
of
solutes
mediated

the
bile
salt
export
pump
(
BSEP
/
ABCB11
)
and
multidrug
resistance
associated
protein-2
(
MRP2
/
ABCC2
)
are
thought
to
involve
bile
acid-dependent
and
-independent
bile
formation
,
respectively
.

To
evaluate
the
potential
of
therapeutic
agents
as
inhibitors
of
such
transporters
on
bile
canalicular
membranes
,
we
examined
the
inhibition
of
the
primary
active
transport
of
typical
substrates
by
15
drugs
,
clinically
known
to
cause
cholestasis
in
canalicular
membrane
vesicles
.

The
inhibition
by
most
of
the
compounds
in
rat
canalicular
membrane
vesicles
(
CMVs
)
was
minimal
or
observed
at
much
higher
concentrations
than
obtained
in
clinical
situations
.

However
,
cloxacillin
,
cyclosporin
A
and
midecamycin
inhibited
BSEP
,
and
cyclosporin
A
and
midecamycin
inhibited
MRP2
with
an
inhibition
constant
close
to
the
clinical
concentration
.

By
comparing
the
inhibition
potential
between
rat
and
human
CMVs
,
the
inhibition
of
BSEP-
and
MRP2-mediated
transport
by
midecamycin
and
cyclosporin
A
was
relatively
similar
whereas
the
inhibitory
effect
on
BSEP-mediated
transport
by
cloxacillin
and
glibenclamide
was
more
marked
in
humans
than
in
rats
.

These
results
suggest
that
the
majority
of
cholestasis-inducing
drugs
have
a
minimal
inhibitory
effect
on
rat
BSEP
and
MRP2
although
species
differences
in
inhibitory
potential

The

in
the

The

Taken

the

Full

to
the

associated
with
a
series
of
undesired
side
effects
,
such
as
weight

,
fluid

,
cardiac

,
and
hepatotoxicity
.

Nevertheless
,
PPARγ
is
involved
in
the
expression
of
genes
that
control
glucose

lipid
metabolism
and
is
an
important
target
for
drugs
against
type

,

,
and

disease
.

In
an
effort
to
identify
novel
PPARγ
ligands
with
an
improved
pharmacological
profile
,
emphasis
has
shifted
to
selective
ligands
with
partial

binding
properties
.

Toward
this
end
we
applied
an
integrated
in

workflow
,
based
on
pharmacophore-
and
structure-based
virtual
screening
of
the
ZINC

coupled
with
competitive

transactivation
assays
,
and
adipocyte

.

Hit

was
identified
as
the
most
potent
ligand
(

)
and
a
relatively
poor
inducer
of
adipocyte

.

The
binding
mode
of

was
confirmed
by

was

A

,
the

,
was
identified
to
be
a
key
substituent
in
the
ligand-protein
interactions
.

Further
studies
on
the
transcriptional
regulation
properties
of
compound
9
revealed
a
gene
regulatory
profile
that
was
to
a
large
extent
unique

closer
to
that
of

Several
types
of
human
tumors
overexpress
cyclooxygenase
(
COX
)
-2
but
not
COX-1
,
and
gene
knockout
transfection
experiments
demonstrate
a
central
role
of
COX-2
in
experimental
tumorigenesis
.

COX-2
produces
prostaglandins
that
inhibit
apoptosis
and
stimulate
angiogenesis
and
invasiveness
.

Selective
COX-2
inhibitors
reduce
prostaglandin
synthesis
,
restore
apoptosis
,
and
inhibit
cancer
cell
proliferation
.

In
animal
studies
they
limit
carcinogen-induced
tumorigenesis
.

In
contrast
,
aspirin-like
nonselective
NSAIDs
such
as
sulindac
and
indomethacin
inhibit
not
only
the
enzymatic
action
of
the
highly
inducible
,
proinflammatory
COX-2
but
the
constitutively
expressed
,
cytoprotective
COX-1
as
well
.

Consequently
,
nonselective
NSAIDs
can
cause
platelet
dysfunction
,
gastrointestinal
ulceration
,
and
kidney
damage
.

For
that
reason
,
selective
inhibition
of
COX-2
to
treat
neoplastic
proliferation
is
preferable
to
nonselective
inhibition
.

Selective
COX-2
inhibitors
,
such
as
meloxicam
,
celecoxib
(
SC-58635
)
,
and
rofecoxib
(
MK-0966
)
,
are
NSAIDs
that
have
been
modified
chemically
to
preferentially
inhibit
COX-2
but
not
COX-1
.

For
instance
,
meloxicam
inhibits
the
growth
of
cultured
colon
cancer
cells
(
HCA-7
and
Moser-S
)
that
express
COX-2
but
has
no
effect
on
HCT-116
tumor
cells
that
do
not
express
COX-2
.

NS-398
induces
apoptosis
in
COX-2
expressing
LNCaP
prostate
cancer
cells
and
,
surprisingly
,
in
colon
cancer
S
/
KS
cells
that
does
not
express
COX-2
.

This
effect
may
due
to
induction
of
apoptosis
through
uncoupling
of
oxidative
phosphorylation
and
down-regulation
of
Bcl-2
,
as
has
been
demonstrated
for
some
nonselective
NSAIDs
,
for
instance
,
flurbiprofen
.

COX-2
mRNA
and
COX-2
protein
is
constitutively
expressed
in
the
kidney
,
brain
,
spinal
cord
,
and
ductus
deferens
,
and
in
the
uterus
during
implantation
.

In
addition
,
COX-2
is
constitutively
and
dominantly
expressed
in
the
pancreatic
islet
cells
.

These
findings
might
somewhat
limit
the
use
of
presently
available
selective
COX-2
inhibitors
in
cancer
prevention
but
will
probably
not
deter
their
successful
application
for
the
treatment
of
human
cancers
.

Fisetin
,
a
flavonol
present
in
vegetables
and
fruits
,
possesses
antioxidative
and
anti-inflammatory
properties
.

In
this
study
,
we
have
demonstrated
that
fisetin
prevents
diet-induced
obesity
through
regulation
of
the
signaling
of
mammalian
target
of
rapamycin
complex
1
(
mTORC1
)
,
a
central
mediator
of
cellular
growth
,
cellular
proliferation
and
lipid
biosynthesis
.

To
evaluate
whether
fisetin
regulates
mTORC1
signaling
,
we
investigated
the
phosphorylation
and
kinase
activity
of
the
70-kDa
ribosomal
protein
S6
kinase
1
(
S6K1
)
and
mTORC1
in
3T3-L1
preadipocytes
.

Fisetin
treatment
of
preadipocytes
reduced
the
phosphorylation
of
S6K1
and
mTORC1
in
a
time-
and
concentration-dependent
manner
.

To
further
our
understanding
of
how
fisetin
negatively
regulates
mTORC1
signaling
,
we
analyzed
the
phosphorylation
of
S6K1
,
mTOR
and
Akt
in
fisetin-treated
TSC2-knockdown
cells
.

The
results
suggested
that
fisetin
treatment
inhibits
mTORC1
activity
in
an
Akt-dependent
manner
.

Recent
studies
have
shown
that
adipocyte
differentiation
is
dependent
on
mTORC1
activity
.

Fisetin
treatment
inhibited
adipocyte
differentiation
,
consistent
with
the
negative
effect
of
fisetin
on
mTOR
.

The
inhibitory
effect
of
fisetin
on
adipogenesis
is
dependent
of
mTOR
activity
,
suggesting
that
fisetin
inhibits
adipogenesis
and
the
accumulation
of
intracellular
triglycerides
during
adipocyte
differentiation
by
targeting
mTORC1
signaling
.

Fisetin
supplementation
in
mice
fed
a
high-fat
diet
(
HFD
)
significantly
attenuated
HFD-induced
increases
in
body
weight
and
white
adipose
tissue
.

We
also
observed
that
fisetin
efficiently
suppressed
the
phosphorylation
of
Akt
,
S6K1
and
mTORC1
in
adipose
tissue
.

Collectively
,
these
results
suggest
that
inhibition
of
mTORC1
signaling
by
fisetin
prevents
adipocyte
differentiation
of
3T3-L1
preadipocytes
and
obesity
in
HFD-fed
mice
.

Therefore
,
fisetin
may
be
a
useful
phytochemical
agent
for
attenuating
diet-induced
obesity
.

To
find
out
the
reason
of
weak

property
of
dihydroetorphine
,
we
compared
the
affinities
of
dihydroetorphine
to
the
type
selective
opioid
receptor
and
inhibition
effect
on
the
adenylyl
cyclase
activity
with
those
of
etorphine
.

Dihydroetorphine
and
etorphine
have
almost
the
same
binding
affinities
to
all
types
(
mu
,
delta
,
and
kappa
)
of
opioid
receptors
and
antagonist
binding
sites
,
and
have
similar
inhibition
activities
to
forskolin
stimulated
adenylyl
cyclase
.

However
,
dihydroetorphine
showed
significantly
smaller
value
of
DTNB-index
compared
with
that
of
etorphine
.

This
differentiation
may
explain
partly
the
high
analgesic

low
dependence
properties
of
dihydroetorphine
.

During
early

in
sheep
,
the
elongating
conceptus
secretes
interferon-τ
(
IFNT
)
and
the
conceptus
as
well
as
endometrial
epithelia
produce
prostaglandins

(
PTGS2
)
and
cortisol
via
hydroxysteroid
(
11-β
)

(
HSD11B1
)
.

Ovarian
progesterone
induces
and
PG
and
IFNT
stimulates
endometrial
HSD11B1
expression
and
keto-reductase
activity
as
well
as
many
epithelial
genes
that
govern
trophectoderm
proliferation
,
migration
,
and
attachment
during
elongation
.

The
primary
aim
of
these
studies
was
to
test
the
hypothesis
that
HSD11B1-derived
cortisol
has
a
biological
role
in
endometrial
function
and
conceptus
development
during
early
pregnancy
in
sheep
.

In

1
,
cyclic

received

PF

(
PF;
a
selective

recombinant

IFNT
,
or
IFNT
and
PF
into
the
uterus
from
day
10
to
day14
after
estrus
.

Cortisol
and
IFNT
stimulated
endometrial
HSD11B1
expression
and
activity
,
increased
endometrial
PTGS2
activity
and
the
amount
of
PG
in
the
uterine
lumen
,
and
up-regulated
many
conceptus
elongation-related
genes
in
the
endometrium
.

Some
effects
of
cortisol
and
IFNT
were
mediated
by
PTGS2-derived
PG
.

In
study
2
,
bred
ewes
received
PF
915275
or
recombinant
ovine
IFNT
and
into
the
uterus
from
day
10
to
day
14
after
mating
.

Inhibition
of
HSD11B1
activity
in
utero
prevented
conceptus
elongation
,
whereas
IFNT
rescued
conceptus
elongation
in
PF-infused
ewes
.

These
results
suggest
that
HSD11B1-derived
cortisol
mediates
,
in
part
,
actions
of
ovarian
progesterone
and
the
conceptus
on
endometrial
function
and
support
the
hypothesis
that
IFNT
,
PG
,
and
cortisol
coordinately
regulate
endometrial
functions
important
for
conceptus
elongation
and
implantation
during

Rooibos
leaves

fine
stems

linearis;
Fabaceae

are
increasingly
enjoyed
as
herbal
tea

largely
in
fermented
(
oxidised
)
red-brown
form
,
but
also
in
unfermented
(
unoxidised
)
green
form
.

Rooibos
is
rich
in
antioxidant
polyphenols
,
with
the
dihydrochalcone
,
aspalathin
,
as
a
major
active
ingredient
.

We
used
Caenorhabditis
elegans
as
model
organism
to
investigate
the
effect
of
rooibos
extracts
against
oxidative
stress
in
vivo
.

In
a
high
glucose
environment
,
C
.

elegans
treated
with
rooibos
extract
exhibited
an
extended
lifespan
.

Furthermore
,
green
rooibos
was
a
more
potent
antioxidant
than
red
rooibos
,
probably
due
to
its
substantially
higher
aspalathin
content
.

In
addition
,
rooibos
decreased
acute
oxidative
damage
caused
by
the
superoxide
anion
radical
generator
,
juglone
,
with
aspalathin
playing
a
major
role
in
improving
the
survival
rate
of
C
.

elegans
.

Quantitative
real-time
PCR
results
demonstrated
that
aspalathin
targets
stress
and
ageing
related
genes
,
reducing
the
endogenous
intracellular
level
of
ROS
.

These
findings
suggest
that
rooibos
increases
stress
resistance
and
promotes
longevity
under
stress
,
probably
mediated
via
a
regulation
of
the
DAF-16
/
FOXO
insulin-like
signalling
pathway
,
supporting
some
of
the
health
claims
put
forward
for

The
approved
treatments
for
Alzheimer's
disease
(
AD
)
exploit
mainly
a
symptomatic
approach
based
on
the
use
of
cholinesterase
inhibitors
or
N-methyl-d-aspartate
(
NMDA
)
receptor
antagonists
.

Natural
antioxidant
compounds
,
able
to
pass
through
the
blood-brain
barrier
(
BBB
)
,
have
been
extensively
studied
as
useful
neuroprotective
agents
.

A
novel
approach
towards
excitotoxicity
protection
and
oxidative
stress
associated
with
excess
β
amyloid
(
Aβ
)
preservation
in
AD
is
represented
by
selective
glutamatergic
antagonists
that
possess
as
well
antioxidant
capabilities
.

In
the
present
work
,
GSH
(
1
)
or
(
R
)
-α-lipoic
acid
(
LA
)
(
2
)
have
been
covalently
linked
with
the
NMDA
receptor
antagonists
memantine
(
MEM
)
.

The
new
conjugates
,
proposed
as
potential
antialzheimer
drugs
,
should
act
both
as
glutamate
receptor
antagonists
and
radical
scavenging
agents
.

The
physico-chemical
properties
and
"in

,
the
enzymatic
and

,
the
demonstrated
"in

antioxidant
activity
associated
to
the
capacity
to
inhibit
Aβ
(

)
aggregation
makes
at
least
compound
2
a
promising
candidate
for
treatment
of
AD
patients
.
The
two
basic
mainstays
of
gastrointestinal
stromal
tumours
(
GIST
)
treatment
are
surgery
and
imatinib
,
a
selective
tyrosine
kinase
inhibitor
that
allows
achieving
a
stable
or
responding
disease
in
about
80%
of
patients
with
unresectable
/
metastatic
GIST
.

Response
to
imatinib
mainly
depends
from
KIT
and
PDGFRα
mutational
status
.

Nevertheless
,
some
patients
with
a
potentially
responsive
genotype
do
not
respond
,
and
others
develop
a
pattern
of
resistance
to
imatinib
which
is
not
associated
with
secondary
mutations
.

This
emphasizes
the
presence
of
mechanisms
of
resistance
other
than
the
receptor-related
genotype
,
and
the
need
of
biological
predictors
to
select
the
optimal
therapeutic
strategy
,
particularly
now
that
other
potent
inhibitors
are
available
.

We
investigated

associated

Included
in

were
polymorphisms
in

family
SLC22

,
and
in
the
metabolizing

CYP-3A4
and

was
significantly
improved
in
presence
of
the
C
allele
in
SLC22A4
(
OCTN1

)
,
and
the
two
minor
alleles
(
G
)
in
SLC22A5
(
OCTN2
rs2631367
and
rs2631372
)
.

Importantly
,
multivariate
analysis
,
adjusting
for
age
,

,
KIT

,
and
tumour
size
,
revealed
that
all
the
three
genotypes
maintained
independent
predictive
significance
.

In
conclusion
,
in
this
study
we
showed
that
SLC22A4
and
SLC22A5
genotypes
may
be
an
important
predictor
of
time
to
progression
in
GIST

are
required
in

Currently
,
there
is
no
satisfactory
treatment
for
pulmonary
fibrosis
,
and
effective
agents
urgently
need
to
be
developed
.

The
aim
of
the
present
study
was
to
investigate
the
effects
of
baicalein
on
bleomycin-induced
pulmonary
fibrosis
,
and
the
novel
mechanisms
involved
in
the
anti-fibrosis
effects
.

Pulmonary
fibrosis
was
induced
by
a
single
intratracheal
instillation
of
5
mg
/
kg
bleomycin
.

Two
bleomycin-treated
groups
were
orally
administered
daily
with
50
and
100
mg
/
kg
of
baicalein
from
day
1
to
28
.

The
results
showed
baicalein
decreased
hydroxyproline
content
and
α-SMA
levels
and
increased
lung
index
.

Histopathological
examinations
demonstrated
baicalein
could
obviously
lower
the
degree
of
alveolitis
and
lung
fibrosis
.

The
total
antioxidant
capacity
in
bleomycin-treated
rats
with
baicalein
was
also
remarkably
higher
than
in
those
without
baicalein
.

Baicalein
remarkably
decreased
miR-21
levels
and
inhibited
the
increased
expression
of
TGF-β1
and
p-Smad-2
/
3
in
bleomycin-treated
rats
.

Baicalein
can
attenuate
bleomycin-induced
pulmonary
fibrosis
.

The
attenuation
is
partly
achieved
by
improving
antioxidant
activity
,
alleviating
inflammation
,
repressing
miR-21
,
and
inhibiting
TGF-β
/
Smad
signaling
.
Although
mitochondrial
import
of
nuclear
DNA-encoded
RNAs
is
widely
occurring
,
their
functions
in
the
organelles
are
not
always
understood
.

Mitochondrial
function
(
s
)
of
tRNA
(
Lys
)
(
CUU
)
,
tRK1
,
targeted
into
Saccharomyces
cerevisiae
mitochondria
was
mysterious
,
since
mitochondrial
DNA-encoded
tRNA
(
Lys
)
(
UUU
)
,
tRK3
,
was
hypothesized
to
decode
both
lysine
codons
,
AAA
and
AAG
.

Mitochondrial
targeting
of
tRK1
depends
on
the
precursor
of
mitochondrial
lysyl-tRNA
synthetase
,
pre-Msk1p
.

Here
we
show
that
substitution
of
pre-Msk1p
by
its
Ashbya
gossypii
ortholog
results
in
a
strain
in
which
tRK3
is
aminoacylated
,
while
tRK1
is
not
imported
.

At
elevated
temperature
,
drop
of
tRK1
import
inhibits
mitochondrial
translation
of
mRNAs
containing
AAG
codons
,
which
coincides
with
the
impaired
2-thiolation
of
tRK3
anticodon
wobble
nucleotide
.

Restoration
of
tRK1
import
cures
the
translational
defect
,
suggesting
the
role
of
tRK1
in
conditional
adaptation
of
mitochondrial
protein
synthesis
.

In
contrast
with
the
known
ways
of
organellar
translation
control
,
this
mechanism
exploits
the
RNA
import
pathway

BACKGROUND
:
Increasing
evidence
from
clinical
trials
indicates
that
carvedilol
,
an
antagonist
of
alpha1-
and
beta-adrenergic
receptors
(
ARs
)
,
provides
an
effective
treatment
for
chronic
heart
failure
,
whereas
nonselective
alpha1-AR
blockade
has
an
adverse
outcome
in
this
disease
.

It
is
,
however
,
not
clear
whether
carvedilol
exhibits
a
subtype-dependent
impact
on
three
distinct
alpha1-adrenergic
receptors
(
alpha1-ARs
)
.

METHODS
AND
RESULTS
:
We
determined
binding
properties
of
human
ARs
for
carvedilol
using
HEK293
human
embryonic
kidney
cells
expressing
a
single
AR
subtype
.

Our
results
showed
that
the
affinities
of
alpha1D-AR
and
alpha1B-AR
for
carvedilol
are
higher
than
that
of
the
beta1-AR
subtype
,
a
major
target
in
heart
failure
treatment
.

The
affinity
rank
order
and
pKi
values
of
ARs
for
carvedilol
were
as
follows
:
alpha1D-AR
(
8
.
9
)
>alpha1B-AR
(
8
.
6
)
>beta1-AR
(
8
.
4
)
>beta2-AR
(
8
.
0
)
>alpha1A-AR
(
7
.
9
)
?alpha2C-AR
(
5
.
9
)
>alpha2B-AR
(
5
.
5
)
>alpha2A-AR
(

.

)
.

Furthermore
,

kinetics
of
intracellular
calcium
signaling
mediated
via
alpha1D-
and
alpha1B-ARs
,
but
not
via
alpha1A-AR

.

)
,
showed
oscillatory
patterns
with
frequencies
ranging
from
0
.
3
to
3
per
minute
in
human
smooth
muscle
and
HEK293
cells
,
which
were
inhibited
by
the
therapeutic
concentrations
of
carvedilol
(
10
nM
)
in
a
subtype-dependent
manner
.

When
oscillatory
alpha1B-AR
and
non-oscillatory
alpha1A-AR
were
co-expressed
and
heteromer
receptors
were
detected
with
bioluminescence
resonance
energy
transfer
and
co-immunoprecipitation
,
carvedilol
suppressed
only
oscillatory
component
of
global
cytosolic
free
calcium
change
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
These
results
indicate
that
in
addition
to
beta-ARs
,
receptor
inhibition
by
carvedilol
is
directed
to
alpha1-ARs
,
preferably
to
alpha1D-
and
alpha1B-AR-mediated
signaling
events
,
including
intracellular
calcium
oscillations
in
vascular
smooth
muscle

OBJECTIVE
:
To
synthesise
results
from
investigations
reporting
on
the
effect
of
antidepressants
on
glucose-insulin
homeostasis
.

METHOD
:
The
authors
conducted
a
MedLine
search
of
all
English
language
articles
from
1966
to
October
2005
using
the
keywords
:
bipolar
disorder
,
major
depressive
disorder
,
diabetes
mellitus
,
glucose
homeostasis
,
and
the
name
of
each
antidepressant
that
has
been
indicated
for
major
depression
in
Canada
and
the
US
up
to
October
2005
.

The
search
was
supplemented
with
a
manual
review
of
relevant
references
.

Both
preclinical
and
clinical
investigations
were
reviewed
.

RESULTS
:
Some
serotonergic
antidepressants
(
e
.

g
.

,
fluoxetine
)
reduce
hyperglycaemia
,
normalise
glucose
homeostasis
and
increase
insulin
sensitivity
,
whereas
some
noradrenergic
antidepressants
(
e
.

g
.

,
desipramine
)
exert
opposite
effects
.

Dual-mechanism
antidepressants
(
e
.

g
.

,
duloxetine
and
venlafaxine
)
do
not
appear
to
disrupt
glucose
homeostatic
dynamics
,
whereas
nonselective
hydrazine
monoamine
oxidase
inhibitors
(
e
.

g
.

,
phenelzine
)
are
associated
with
hypoglycaemia
and
an
increased
glucose
disposal
rate
.

CONCLUSION
:
Some
antidepressants
exert
a
clinically
significant
effect
on
metabolism
relevant
to
both
therapeutic
outcome
and
adverse
events
.
